						<h1>Pool.com Privacy Statement</h1>
						<h2>Why A Privacy Statement?</h2>
						<p>We respect your individual privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy 
							Statement, which embodies our commitment to the protection of your privacy 
							through adherence to fair electronic information practices. This Privacy 
							Statement puts you, the individual, in control of how your personal information 
							is processed, and you have our promise that we will not electronically process 
							your personal information in any way that is incompatible with this Privacy 
							Statement. This Privacy Statement protects your privacy by:</p>
						<h3><u>informing</u> you about:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
							the types of personal information Pool.com collects about you through its 
							website;
							</li><li>
							how it collects that information;
							</li><li>
							the general purposes for which it collects such information;
							</li><li>
							the types of organizations to which it discloses the information;
							</li><li>
								the choices and means by which individuals may limit its use and disclosure.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3><u>empowering</u> you to choose:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
							whether and how certain personal information you provide is used (where such 
							use is unrelated to the uses for which you originally disclosed it); and
							</li><li>
								whether and the manner in which a third party uses certain personal information 
								you provide (where such use is unrelated to the uses for which you originally 
								disclosed it).
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3><u>assuring</u> you that Pool.com:
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
							takes reasonable precautions to protect personal information from loss, misuse, 
							unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction;
							</li><li>
							implements reasonable policies and procedures to ensure that personal 
							information is kept only for the purposes for which it has been gathered;
							</li><li>
							uses reasonable measures to ensure that we have accurately and completely 
							recorded the personal information you have provided; and
							</li><li>
								provides you reasonable access to your personal information as well as 
								procedures for correcting or modifying that information where appropriate.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3><u>ensuring</u> accountability to individuals who believe that Pool.com has 
							not complied with these privacy principles.
						</h3>
						<p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Statement, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@pool.com">
								privacy@pool.com</a>.</p>
						<h2>Getting To Know Our Customers</h2>
						<p>Pool.com is in the business of providing compelling, tailored services to our 
							customers. That requires more than simply offering innovative technical 
							services. It also requires that we understand you, our customer, and your 
							needs.</p>
						<p>We get to know you primarily through the information you provide to us when 
							signing up for, or using, one or more of our services. The information you 
							provide ranges from basic contact information and your payment information. The 
							application for domain backorder services is a representative illustration of 
							the information we request of you. All of the information we request from you 
							when purchasing our services is obligatory unless otherwise noted on the 
							relevant form. When you purchase our services, you agree to provide and 
							maintain accurate, complete and updated information.</p>
						<p>After you've signed up for our services, we may be in communication with you 
							about your account, technical questions you may have about services provided by 
							us, or other matters relating to those services. Those communications are 
							essential to our relationship with you and to our ability to provide you with 
							quality services that are responsive to your needs. At the same time, those 
							communications give us helpful insights about you, your preferences and the 
							ways in which we might improve our services. We therefore may maintain this 
							information for future use.</p>
						<p>Additionally, for operational and quality assurance purposes, we take note of 
							whether and how you use the information and services that we provide, such as 
							by recording site traffic patterns and by maintaining log files of users' 
							access to site files.
						</p>
						<p>The information we receive from or about you is stored on systems designed to 
							prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or 
							destruction of that information. We also encrypt your transmission of sensitive 
							information to us (e.g., credit card numbers, account passwords) in the 
							interest of heightened privacy protection and information integrity.</p>
						<p>By providing a domain backorder service, we gather and transmit to partner 
							registrars information about you that is required to complete a domain name 
							registration on your behalf. This information includes basic information about 
							each domain acquired through us, including the names, telephone numbers and 
							email addresses of individuals designated as the owners of a given domain name. 
							Please see the Pool.com Terms and Conditions for additional information that we 
							require in order to complete a domain registration on your behalf, and your 
							obligations with respect to that information.</p>
						<h2>Information Corrections Or Changes</h2>
						<p>You have the ability to correct or change certain information in our records, 
							such as your address and contact information. All aspects of your account can 
							be managed and changed through the <a href="MyAccount/Preferences.aspx" target="_blank">
								Preferences</a> page located within your account. You may change this 
							information at any time and as often as necessary. If you need assistance or 
							have questions about correcting information, you can contact our <a href="contactus.aspx">customer service department</a>
                            .</p>
						<h2>How We Put Information To Good Use</h2>
						<p>We use information about you for purposes of monitoring and improving our 
							internal operations, as well as to ensure that we: (i) bill you properly, (ii) 
							administer your account in accordance with your agreements with us and (iii) 
							properly perform the services you have requested.</p>
						<p>We also use the information we collect to monitor and improve our internal 
							operations, as well as to improve the experience of users in our network of 
							sites. For example, we may correlate website traffic information with data 
							about individual users. We may also break down overall usage statistics 
							according to customers' domain names, browser types, and MIME types by reading 
							this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's 
							browser).</p>
						<p>Another example of our use of information to enhance the experience of users in 
							our network of sites is our reliance on cookie files. We use cookie files to 
							make it easier for users to access our site or services. A cookie file is a 
							small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit 
							them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site 
							uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a 
							cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data 
							off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies 
							to track user traffic patterns (as described above) when you register for 
							Pool.com’s services. When you register, we may use a cookie to store a unique, 
							random user ID. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and 
							to track the pages you visit on our site. This type of temporary cookie lasts 
							only for your current session on our web page and is not used after your 
							session expires. We use it primarily to keep track of information during your 
							session, such as what services you have selected to register.</p>
						<p>If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will 
							receive the warning message with each cookie. You may refuse cookies by turning 
							them off in your browser; however, some of our sites may require a cookie for 
							access.</p>
						<p>Finally, we use the information we collect to direct important notices and 
							information affecting your account or services such as explicitly identified 
							email notifications regarding the status of backordered domains, keyword 
							alerts, auctions/bid statuses as well as confirmations of domain purchases. We 
							may also from time to time provide general information that may be of interest 
							to you, including surveys, contest and sweepstake announcements, and 
							information about our service or product offerings or the offerings of our 
							business partners and affiliates. You may opt out of receiving information from 
							us simply by notifying us of your desire in accordance with the opt-out 
							instructions contained in any information message you receive from us. Note, 
							however, that in order to fulfill our service obligations to you, we must 
							continue sending you notices and other important information affecting your 
							account or services.
						</p>
						<h2>With Whom We May Share Information</h2>
						<p>When you acquire a backordered domain through us, we must disclose information 
							about your domain name and your contact details with a partner registrar who 
							will be registering the domain for you. Our partner registrars, in turn, are 
							required to share such information with the domain registry. Our partner 
							registrars also currently make certain information about you available to the 
							general public via their domain name registration database look-up and 
							directory services. These services give users access to such data on a 
							query-by-query basis. Qualified persons may also access such data on a bulk 
							basis provided they agree, among other things, not to use the data to enable or 
							otherwise support the transmission of mass unsolicited commercial advertising 
							or solicitations via email; or (ii) sell or redistribute the data to third 
							parties. Please see the <a href="terms.aspx" target="_blank">Pool.com Terms and 
								Conditions</a> for additional information that we require in order to 
							complete a domain registration on your behalf, and your obligations with 
							respect to that information. Please note, that consistent with the current 
							rules and policies for the Domain Name System, information about you must 
							remain available in the publicly accessible registration database.</p>
						<p>We may share certain information about you with those of our vendors who are 
							responsible for handling your account or performing other necessary services 
							that you require. Although we may share sensitive financial information (i.e., 
							credit card numbers, banking information), security information (e.g., account 
							passwords) and personal communications (e.g., personal email messages or 
							message board postings) with such vendors where necessary and appropriate, we 
							will not share such information with other third parties, except in response to 
							formal requests (e.g., subpoena or court order) made in connection with 
							reasonable dispute resolution mechanisms, litigation or arbitration proceedings 
							directly relating to a domain name registration or other services we provide. 
							In the event that certain services provided to you by or through Pool.com or 
							one of its business partners, are to be provided to you by a substitute service 
							provider, your information may be transferred to the substitute service 
							provider provided that such substitute entity agrees to be bound by the terms 
							of this privacy statement in effect at the time of performance of the services.</p>
						<p>Additionally, we may share your information, as well as other information that 
							is not of a sensitive nature, with carefully selected business partners, 
							including those who offer services that complement those provided by us or 
							which may otherwise be of interest to you. We may collect your information and 
							aggregate it with other data for statistical purposes, and share such 
							aggregated data with other business partners.
						</p>
						<h2>Our Accountability To You</h2>
						<p>By purchasing our services, you obtain the protections of, and consent to the 
							data processing practices described in, this Privacy Statement. When you 
							purchase our services, you also represent to us that you have provided notice 
							to, and obtained consent from, any third party individuals whose personal data 
							you supply to us with regard to: (i) the purposes for which such third party's 
							personal data have been collected, (ii) the intended recipients or categories 
							of recipients of the third party's personal data, (iii) which of the third 
							party's data are obligatory and which data, if any, are voluntary, and (iv) how 
							the third party can access and, if necessary, rectify the data held about them.</p>
						<p>In addition to the privacy protections that we provide, our employees, agents, 
							business partners and affiliates are independently responsible for ensuring 
							compliance with this Privacy Statement, as described below.</p>
						<h2>Employee Accountability</h2>
						<p>Only those Pool.com employees that have a legitimate business purpose for 
							accessing and handling personal information obtained by us are given 
							authorization to do so. The unauthorized access or use of such information by a 
							Pool.com employee is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary 
							action.</p>
						<p>Additionally, our information management systems are configured in such a way as 
							to block or inhibit employees from accessing information that they have no 
							authority to access.</p>
						<h2>The Accountability of Pool.com's Agents and Business Partners</h2>
						<p>Our trusted vendors, business partners and affiliates are responsible for 
							processing or handling some of the information that we receive. These vendors, 
							business partners and affiliates are not authorized to use such information for 
							purposes beyond those specified by us and are required to preserve the 
							confidentiality with which we treat such information.</p>
						<p>If you feel that Pool.com, or any of our agents, representatives or employees, 
							is violating this Privacy Statement, please contact our <a href="../contactus.aspx">customer service department</a>.</p>
