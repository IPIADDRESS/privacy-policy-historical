      <h1><strong>APA Website Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
      <p><strong>Effective January 8, 2008:</strong></p>
      <p> <br>
        We operate  all American Poolplayers Association, Inc. (APA) branded   URL, including without  limitation our National Website, Local League   Websites, and Member Website  (collectively the “APA Website”).&nbsp; <br>
        This  Privacy Policy describes our use and sharing of Personal   Identifiable  Information (PII) — your full name, email address, mailing   address, telephone  number, or credit card number that Users   voluntarily provide to us when they  register (also known as   “Registration PII”).&nbsp;The Term “User” refers to a  Visitor or a   Registered User.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies only to information  that   we collect from the APA Website. This Website Privacy Policy does not    apply to other information that we may collect through other sources or   from  other means, including, without limitation, information that we   may collect  from any email messages and associated information that you   may send to  addresses published on the APA Website. <br>
        The APA Website  is a general audience site and does not knowingly   collect PII from children  under 13 years of age. <br>
        From time  to time we may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry   initiatives or  changes in the law, our PII collection and use   practices, the features of the  Services, or technology, and such   modifications shall be effective upon posting  by us on the APA   Website.&nbsp;When we do make changes to the Website Privacy  Policy, we will   change the "effective date” at the top of this Privacy  Policy. Your   continued use of the Services after we post a revised Privacy  Policy   signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.&nbsp;It is    therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to   ensure you  are updated as to any changes.&nbsp;If we materially change our   practices  regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will   continue to be governed  by the Policy under which it was collected   unless you have been provided notice  of, and have not objected to, the   change.</p>
      <h2> <br>
        <strong>COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION OF PII AND NON-PII</strong></h2>
      <p><strong><u>General.</u></strong> When we collect PII from you it is    because you are voluntarily submitting Registration&nbsp;PII to us in order   to  register to become a Member of APA or a Registered User of the   Services.&nbsp;  We may also collect PII from you if you choose to   participate in Services  activities, like sweepstakes, contests, and   surveys, because you want us to  furnish you with products, services,   newsletters, or information, or in  connection with content or   suggestions you submit to us for review. <br>
        In  addition, we collect other non-PII including IP address, aggregate   user data,  and browser type. This data is used to manage and improve   the Services, track  usage, and for security purposes.&nbsp;<br>
        Services  may allow Registered Users to choose to provide or store   non-PII information in  user profiles, including but not limited to date   of birth, interests, hobbies,  lifestyle choices, groups with whom they   are affiliated (schools, companies),  videos and/or pictures, private   messages, bulletins or personal statements  (collectively “Profile   Information”).&nbsp;The Profile Information in a  Registered User’s profile   is provided at his or her sole discretion.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small bits of  information that   we place on your computer. We use cookies to identify your  Internet   browser, store User preferences, and determine whether you have    installed the enabling software needed to access certain material on   Services.  Data in cookies may be read to authenticate User sessions or   provide services.<br>
        Third  party advertisements displayed on Services may also contain   cookies set by  Internet advertising companies or advertisers (known as   “third party cookies”).&nbsp;We  do not control these third party cookies and   Users of the Services should check  the privacy policy of the Internet   advertising company or advertiser to see  whether and how it uses   cookies. &nbsp;A pixel tag is a tiny image inserted in  a Web page and used   to record the number and types of views for that page. We may  allow   third party pixel tags to be present on Services for purposes of    advertising, providing services or data and statistics collection. <br>
        You can  program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being   sent, block third  party cookies or block all cookies.&nbsp;However, by   blocking all cookies you  may not have access to certain features on   Services.</p>
      <p><strong>Information Use and Sharing </strong><br>
        We use PII  for the purposes for which it was collected. For example,   to the extent that we  collect PII for membership registration, we will   use such information in  connection with, among other things, providing   you with membership services  which may include the creation of a   membership directory which may be provided  to others. <br>
        In  addition to using PII for the purposes for which it was collected,   we may also  use PII to send you publications, invitations and other   marketing materials  that may be of interest to you. <br>
        We may  share your PII with third parties including, without   limitation, affiliated  entities, and third parties performing services   for or on our behalf (such as  communications, event management, and/or   marketing services). <br>
        We may  disclose PII when we reasonably believe that the law requires   it, and/or when  we have reason to believe that disclosing such   information is necessary to  identify, contact, or bring legal action   against someone who may be causing  injury to, or interference with   (either intentionally or unintentionally), our  rights or property,   other Users of the APA Website, or anyone else who could be  harmed by   such activities. <br>
        We might  sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such   transactions, PII may be  one of the transferred business assets. <br>
        We use  non-PII to help us run and maintain the APA Website, study   traffic patterns and  generally learn about the usage of the APA   Website. We may also use such  information for purposes of system   administration, to improve the design and  content of the APA Website,   and/or to enable us to personalize your Internet  experience. We may   disclose non-PII to third parties including advertisers,  business   partners, and sponsors, to analyze site usage and manage and improve    our business relationships. <br>
        Services  may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies.   Services may also  carry advertisements from other companies.&nbsp;We are   not responsible for the  privacy practices of websites or other services   operated by third parties that  are linked to or integrated with   Services or for the privacy practices of third  party Internet   advertising companies.&nbsp;Once you leave Services via such a  link, access a   third party application (such as widgets) or click on an    advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the   third  party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how   they will handle  any PII they collect from you.<br>
        We may  periodically use your email address to send you such materials   related to  Services and APA Pool Leagues, events and activities. &nbsp;If   you want to stop  receiving such materials from us, you can change your   profile settings under  “Account Settings,” or follow the unsubscribe   instructions at the bottom of  each email.&nbsp;<br>
        We may  customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive   on the APA Website,  or may work with outside companies to do so.&nbsp;Your   non-PII and/or Profile  Information may be shared with these companies   so this customization can be  accomplished.&nbsp;We prohibit these companies   from sharing your non-PII and/or  Profile Information with any third   party or from using it for any other  purpose. Anonymous click stream,   number of page views calculated by pixel tags,  and aggregated   demographic information may also be shared with our advertisers  and   business partners. <br>
        There may  be instances when we may access or disclose PII, Profile   Information or non-PII  without providing you a choice in order to: (i)   protect or defend the legal  rights or property of APA, our Affiliated   Companies or their employees, agents  and contractors (including   enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the  safety and security of   Users of the APA Services or members of the public  including acting in   urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or for  risk   management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process.&nbsp;In    addition, if we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or   transfer of  all or a material part of our assets or are otherwise   involved in a merger or  transfer of all or a material part of its   business, we may transfer your PII to  the party or parties involved in   the transaction as part of that transaction.</p>
      <p><strong>Updating Your Information </strong><br>
        If you  want to change, correct, or update personally identifiable   information you  submit on our APA Website, please contact us as   provided in the contact section  below, and we will use reasonable   efforts to make any necessary revisions. </p>
      <p><strong>Security </strong><br>
        We use  commercially reasonable administrative, technical personnel and   physical  measures to safeguard PII and any credit card information in   its possession  against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or    modification.&nbsp;Unfortunately, information transmitted on the Internet    and/or stored on systems is not 100% secure. As a result, we do not   ensure,  warrant or guarantee the security or integrity of any   information transmitted  to us over the Internet or stored on our   systems. </p>
      <p><strong>Contact Information </strong><br>
        If you  have questions or concerns regarding this Website Privacy   Policy, please send  an email to <a href="https://www.poolplayers.com/forms/website-feedback.html" target="_blank">the Webmaster</a> . </p>
      <p><strong>How do I opt-out? </strong><br>
        From time  to time we have sponsors who may want to send you an offer or   information based  on the information you provide through your   membership application. We may  share our membership information with   our sponsors for these purposes. If you  would prefer to be eliminated   from these lists, <a href="https://www.poolplayers.com/opt-out.html"><strong>please   fill in the opt-out form</strong></a> located on this page and click    "submit"; your name will be withheld from these particular  lists.&nbsp;   Choosing to opt-out, however,  does not eliminate you from the list that   we may use on occasion for its own  purposes.</p>
