<p class="story_text">We are committed to protecting the online privacy of visitors to  our websites.  This Policy does not cover  any interaction you may have with us by telephone, postal mail, or other  offline communications. Our websites are not designed for use by children. We  ask that anyone under the age of thirteen not submit any personal information  through our websites. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from  children under the age of thirteen, and therefore we do not knowingly distribute  such information to third parties.</p>
<p><strong class="stockinfo_header">I. Information That We Collect</strong></p>
<p><span class="related_linkhead">Personal  Information</span><br>
    <span class="story_text">At various locations on our websites, we may request that you supply us with  "personal information," such as your name, email address, mailing and  shipping addresses, home or work telephone number, and/or credit card  information. You will always know when we are collecting personal information  because we only collect personal information when you voluntarily submit it to  us. If you do choose to give us personal information through our websites, we  will collect and retain that information. </span><br>
    <span class="related_linkhead"><br>
      Non-Personal  Information</span><br>
  <span class="story_text">When you use our websites, we may also collect "non-personal  information," which is information that, by itself, cannot be used to  identify or contact you, such as demographic information (such as your age,  gender, income, education, profession, zip code, etc.) or technical information  (such as your IP address, the type of browser you are using, the websites you  visit immediately before and immediately after you visit our websites, and  other anonymous data involving your use of our websites). Non-personal  information may also include information that you provide us through your use  of our websites, such as the terms you enter into the search functions of our  websites. </span><br>
  <span class="related_linkhead"><br>
    Cookies</span><br>
  <span class="story_text">We use "cookies" to enhance your visits to our websites. Our cookies  can store your password, personalize pages, and keep track of selections, such  as your time zone and episode selections, or items you have placed in a  "shopping cart." </span></p>
<p><strong class="stockinfo_header">II. How We Use the Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p><span class="related_linkhead">Our Services  and Websites</span><br>
    <span class="story_text">We use your personal information to provide you any services that you may  request or require, to communicate with you, to allow you to make purchases,  and to allow you to participate in online contests, surveys and games. We use  aggregated non-personal information about our users to understand our website's  demographics, such as the percentage of male and female users, the geographic  distribution of our users, the age ranges of our users, or a combination of  these or other demographics. We use the non-personal information we collect to  analyze how our websites are being used, and to improve the content of our  websites, online product offerings, and marketing and promotional efforts. </span><br>
    <span class="related_linkhead"><br>
      Email Communications</span><br>
  <span class="story_text">If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personal  information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your  questions or comments for future reference. There may be times when you will  have the opportunity to subscribe to an email list or electronic newsletter  that will send information about our websites or our advertisers to your email  address. However, we will provide you with the option to change your  preferences and opt-out of receiving those communications by clicking the  "unsubscribe" link included in the email. If you unsubscribe, we will  make reasonable efforts to discontinue these email communications as soon as  practicable.</span>
</p>
<p><strong class="stockinfo_header">III. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</strong><br>
  <span class="related_linkhead"><br>
Affiliates and Non-Affiliates</span><br>
<span class="story_text">Except as specifically set forth in this Policy, we do not share your personal  information with any non-affiliated third party without your permission. We may  disclose aggregate information, such as demographic information, and our  statistical analyses to third parties, including advertisers or other business  partners. This aggregate information does not include your personal  information. We may, however, share your personal information with certain  websites that control us, are controlled by us, or under common control with us  (our "Affiliates"), and websites operated by our Affiliates or other  businesses of SCP Pool Corporation, our parent company, so that they and we can  offer you products and services that may be of interest to you. </span> <br>
<span class="related_linkhead"><br>
Service Providers</span><br>
<span class="story_text">We sometimes engage unaffiliated businesses to assist us in providing you  certain services. In those instances, we may need to share your personal  information with them. We sometimes offer promotions (like sweepstakes) in  conjunction with a third party sponsor. If you choose to participate in one of  those promotions, we may share your information with the sponsor. </span> <br>
<span class="related_linkhead"><br>
Business  Transactions</span><br>
<span class="story_text">We may buy, sell or combine with other businesses. If so, personal and  non-personal information that we or other businesses have collected will likely  be transferred as part of the transaction.</span> <br>
<span class="related_linkhead"><br>
Third Party  Advertisers</span><br>
<span class="story_text">We use third-party advertising companies to deliver specific advertisements to  you, which appear on pages throughout our websites. These companies collect  non-personal information about your visits to our websites and other websites  in order to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of  interest to you. These companies may also aggregate your non-personal  information for use in targeted advertising, marketing research, and other  similar purposes. These companies may place their own cookies on your computer. </span><br>
<span class="related_linkhead"><br>
Other  Disclosures</span><br>
<span class="story_text">We may disclose personal information when we are required or requested to do so  by law, court order or other government or law enforcement authority or  regulatory agency; to enforce or apply our rights and agreements; or when we  believe in good faith that disclosing this information is necessary or  advisable, including, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety  of mypoolparts.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information  with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk  reduction. We may share your personal information with our  subsidiaries and affiliates. </span></p>
<p><strong class="stockinfo_header">IV. Security of the Information We Collect</strong><br>
  <span class="related_linkhead"><br>
  </span><span class="story_text">The security of  your personal information is important to us. We maintain physical, electronic,  and procedural safeguards to secure your personal information. However, there  is always some risk in transmitting information electronically. As we deem  appropriate, we use security measures consistent with industry standards.  However, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we  guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being  transmitted to us over the Internet. Of course, any information you post to any  message board, discussion group, or other public posting area on our websites  is available to anyone with Internet access.</span></p>
<p><strong class="stockinfo_header">V. Accuracy of the Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p><span class="story_text">Any questions  you may have regarding our Privacy Policy, the accuracy of your personal  information or the use of your personal information, or any requests that we  correct, update, or remove your information in our databases, should be  directed via email to <a href="mailto:privacy@poolcorp.com">privacy@poolcorp.com</a>.                    After receiving  a request to change your information, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure  that all of your personal information stored in databases we actively use to  operate our website will be updated as soon as reasonably practicable. However,  we reserve the right to retain in our archival files any information we remove  from or change in our active website databases. In addition, it is not  technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you  have provided to us. A copy of your personal information may exist in a  non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate.          We reserve the  right to change this Policy at any time, and will post any changes to this  Policy as soon as they go into effect. Please refer back to this Policy on a  regular basis. </span></p>
