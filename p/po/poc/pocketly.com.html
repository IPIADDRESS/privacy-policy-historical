<p>Here at Pocketly we recognize that your privacy is very important, and to keep you informed about our privacy
    practices we ask that you please read the guidelines described below. Keep in mind that because Pocketly is
    growing and internet technologies are constantly evolving, these guidelines are subject to change and any said
    changes will be posted on this page. Pocketly is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of

</p><h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p>During registration for membership, we may collect personal information such as your name, email address,
    birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For some financial products
    and services we may also ask for more information. Additionally, with your permission we may use location
    data via the GPS in your mobile or other device running the Pocketly App. With your permission or if you
    login using 3rd party accounts, we also may gather information from your Facebook or Twitter profiles,
    which my include your user name and IDs associated with those accounts. We usually collect personal
    information directly from you although sometimes we may use agents or service providers to do this for us.
    When you are online, we collect information regarding the pages within our network that you visit. We may
    also acquire lists from other sources, both from other companies and from other public documents. For each
    visitor on our website, our web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, but not
    the e-mail address (where possible). Additionally, we may collect device and usage information that may
    include (i) information specific to your mobile device (e.g., make, model, operating system, device identifier
    and similar information); (ii) information about your use of features, functions, or notifications on the device;
    and (iii) signal strength relating to WiFi or Bluetooth functionality, temperature, battery level, and similar
    technical data.</p>

<h3>Location Information</h3>

<p>Use of our mobile application may, at your election, include location-based services. When you use the app, you
    may transmit information about your location to Pocketly. That information will be used to offer you deals and
    coupons that are close to your geographic location.</p>

<h3>Use of Information</h3>

<p>
    We use your information to provide our services to you, to fulfill administrative functions associated with
    these services, to enter into contracts with you or third parties, and for marketing and client relationship
    purposes. We share the information we collect with third-party business partners who commit to comply with
    applicable laws concerning their usage of the information.  Our third-party business partners may share the
    information with their own third party business partners and use the information either for themselves or on
    behalf of their own business partners to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Operate and improve their services;</li>
    <li>Provide you with advertisements and information for products and services or send you other notifications
        based on variables such as your location, and assess your level of engagement with them; and</li>
    <li>Carry out other purposes that are disclosed to you and to which you consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You may receive e-mails from us to let you know about new products, services, and upcoming events that may
    interest you. If you do not want to receive e-mails from us or you want to make changes to your e-mail settings,
    please change your setting under your setting tab. We will never sell or distribute your e-mail address to other
    companies or organizations, and your account password will always remain protected. We may use customer information
    for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change
    at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our website to notify you of these changes, and
    provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used,
    you should check our Privacy Policy periodically.

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a piece of data that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
    Cookies can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site or app, and they allow us to track usage
    patterns and to compile data that can help us improve our content and target advertising. If you do not want
    information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you
    to deny or accept the cookie feature. But you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you with
    features such as merchandise transactions or registered services.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 provides safeguards to protect children who use the
    internet by regulating the online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. Because
    of these safeguards, children under the age of 13 are not able to access or use all products and services on
    Pocketly.</p>

<h3>Use of Aggregate Data</h3>

<p>We may collect certain non-personal information to optimize our website for your computer or mobile device (e.g.,
    the identity of your Internet browser, model of your mobile device, the type of operating system you use, your
    IP address, and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may use such non-personal information for
    internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of our website and App. Pocketly may use
    personally identifiable information in aggregate form to improve our goods and services, including our website,
    and to make them more responsive to the needs of our customers. This statistical compilation and analysis of
    information may also be used by Pocketly, or provided to others as a summary report for marketing, advertising,
    or research purposes.</p>

<h3>Confidentiality and Security</h3>

<p>We limit access to personal information about you to employees for whom we reasonably believe it is necessary in
    order to provide products or services to you. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that
    comply with federal regulations to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have
    collected from you at our website.</p>

<h3>What else you should know about privacy on the Internet</h3>

<p>Remember to close your browser or log out of the app when you have finished your Pocketly session. This is to
    ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer or mobile
    device with someone else or are using a computer or mobile device in a public place, like a library or internet
    cafe. You as an individual are responsible for the security of and access to your own computer.
    Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the internet, this information can be collected and
    used by others. In short, if you post personal information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive
    unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
    Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords and any
    account information.
    Please be careful and responsible whenever you are using the internet.</p>
