    <h1>Privacy Policy <small>It's long, but it's written in English, not Legalese.</small></h1>
</div>
<div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span6">

    <p>This policy covers how IC Group treats personal information that we
    collect and receive through our Pobox.com and Listbox.com web sites.
    Personal information is information about you that is personally
    identifiable, such as your name, address, email address, or phone number,
    and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>

    <p><strong>Advertising</strong> We do not sell advertising space on any of
    our websites.  You may see notices about our own products, but we do not
    use your eyeballs to make money.</p>
    
    <p>We also do not distribute ads by email, either to Pobox subscribers or
    through our mailing lists.  We do not even tell you about our own products,
    unless you have asked us to, or there is a change that will affect, or has
    affected, your service (recent examples include changes to SMTP service).</p>

    <p><strong>Your Personal Information</strong> When you register with us, we
    ask for your name, mailing address, telephone number, and a security
    question of your choosing.  We collect, store, and use this personal
    information to confirm your identity when you contact us, and to contact
    you regarding your account.  That's it.</p>

    <p>If you do not provide that information accurately, you reduce
    our ability to confirm your identity as the account holder.  If
    you feel very strongly about this matter, we urge you to fill in
    as much as possible, and select a strong security question and
    answer
    (in <a href="http://pobox.com/home/change-password/">the
    Personal Information section of the User's Area</a>) and to
    <strong>remember the answer</strong>.  IC Group is not liable for any
    changes made to your account as a result of our inability to confirm your
    identity.</p>

    <p>Because we do not derive income from advertising, we do not aggregate
    your personal information for marketing purposes.  However, we may use your
    data to determine some basic information about our user base (for example,
    how many customers do we have in a particular country.)</p>

    <p>We do not sell, loan, lease, give away, share or in any other way make
    your personal information or your Pobox address available to parties other
    than IC Group, Inc. and its affiliates, except:</p>

    <ul class="text_only"> 
      <li>when you have given us permission (example: to deal with another
      company on your behalf);</li> 
      <li>when you have violated
      our <a href="http://www.pobox.com/user-agreement">Terms of
      Service</a>, and misused your Pobox account for spam or other
      prohibited uses;</li>
      <li>in the event of a merger or a transfer of all or substantially all
      our assets to a third party, provided that we will notify you before
      personal information becomes subject to a different privacy policy;
      and</li>
      <li>to comply with law or legal process (subpoenas), or to establish or
      exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</li> 
    </ul>

    <p>If your information has been subpoenaed from us, you will be informed
    unless we are specifically barred from doing so by the subpoena.</p>

    <p><strong>Accessing and Changing Your Account Information</strong>
    You can access and edit your account information at any time (in fact,
    we encourage you to keep this information up to date, so that we do not we
    try to call you and find the phone number disconnected).  Your personal
    information can be edited at <a href="https://www.pobox.com/home/change-info/">the Personal Information
    section of the User's Area.</a></p>

    <p>Your account can be canceled at any time by going
    to <a href="http://www.pobox.com/home/cancel/">http://www.pobox.com/home/cancel/</a>,
    responding to invoices with "cancel", or by contacting
    our Customer Service staff at <a title="Send an email to Pobox
    Support" href="mailto:pobox@pobox.com">pobox@pobox.com</a>.  If
    you ask us to delete your account, your account will usually be
    deactivated and we will stop accepting mail for your addresses
    within 1 hour.  Please note that information may remain in back-up
    storage for some further period of time. </p>

    <p><strong>Security</strong> We have physical, electronic, and procedural
    safeguards to protect personal information about you; however we cannot
    guarantee that someone won't be able to circumvent these safeguards.  These
    safeguards include, but are not limited to, mandating password protection
    for all accounts, confirming that a request to send personal information or
    passwords to email addresses not listed in an account was submitted by a
    person authorized to do so for that account, encrypting credit card and
    password information within our system, and taking measures to protect our
    servers, databases and other system components against intrusions,
    tampering, and other attacks.</p>


    </div>
    <div class="span6">
    <p><strong>Information We Store - Pobox Basic and Pobox Plus</strong> We do
    not store messages coming through our servers for forwarding accounts.
    Once we receive a message, we immediately attempt to process it, and send
    it to your forwarding address.  We will keep that message in the following
    cases:</p>

    <ol class="text_only">
      <li>There is a problem with your forwarding address.  We will attempt to
      resend the message for a maximum of 5 days.</li> 
      <li>You have set your email or spam filters to discard the message.  We
      will keep the message for 30 days, in case you discarded something you
      wanted.  Discards may also be used to tune the spam filters.</li> 
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Information We Store — Pobox Mailstore</strong> We store
    messages coming through our servers for Mailstore accounts.  Messages are
    stored until you delete them or your account has reached its quota, at
    which point new messages will not be stored.</p> <p>If your account is
    terminated, your messages will be stored for an additional 30 days, then
    deleted at the same time your account settings are deleted.</p>

    <p><strong>Cookies</strong> We use cookies.  Why?  It's
    the simplest way, technically, to allow you to use our website.  We know
    that it would be possible to run the site without cookies, but it is a
    needless complication.  Here's what our cookies do:</p>

    <ul class="text_only">
      <li>If you check the box that says "Remember my username in the future", we
      put a cookie on your machine that does exactly that.  It doesn't expire,
      because it would be useless if it did.</li> 
      <li>If you don't check that box, you will get a cookie once your password
      has been authorized.  It will authorize your browser to make changes to
      your account for up to an hour, at which point it will expire.</li> 
    </ul>

    <p>We do not issue third-party cookies.  You will receive cookies
    from one of these 3 domains or their subdomains: pobox.com,
    listbox.com and icgroup.com (our parent company.)</p>

    <p><strong>Customer Service and System Maintenance</strong> All messages
    sent to our customer service department are saved indefinitely, and become
    our property.  If you contact Customer Service, we reserve the right to
    change your account settings or send email to your account in order to
    solve the problem.  You may also receive test emails if we detect a problem
    with your account, even if you have not contacted us.</p>

    <p><strong>Anonymity</strong> Pobox.com is not an anonymous remailer.  Your
    forwarding address may be revealed to your correspondents through bounce
    messages.</p>

    <p><strong>Ownership Issues</strong> All data, including emails, list
    content, subscriber lists and any list information disseminated through the
    Pobox.com or Listbox.com services, is the express property <strong>of the account
    owner</strong> and/or the author of a particular message.</p>

    <p><strong>List Privacy</strong> We do not make any information about our
    lists public.  There is no system-wide database of lists.  We do not
    provide listnames to people making inquiries.  All of our privacy policies
    apply to your list subscribers as well as yourself.</p>


    <p><strong>Information We Store - Listbox</strong> All messages sent to
    lists are stored for the life of the list.</p> <p>Subscription or other
    administrative requests sent via email are stored for 30 days.</p>

    <p><strong>Children</strong> Children under the age of 13 are not eligible
    to hold Pobox.com accounts and should not submit any personal information
    to us.</p>

    <p><strong>Changes to the Policy</strong> We reserve the right to update
    this privacy policy.  If there are material changes, we will either notify
    you via e-mail or post notification prominently on our web site prior to
    implementing the changes.  If you would like to receive notice via email,
    please go to <a href="https://www.pobox.com/home/change-info/">the Personal
    Information section of the User's Area</a>, and specify that you would like
    to receive announcements from us.</p>

    <p><strong>Contact Us</strong> If you have any questions about our privacy
    policy, or there are any categories that you think we haven't covered,
    please let us know.  We have tried to be as comprehensive as possible, but
    we'd like to know if we've missed anything.  You can contact us <a href="http://www.pobox.com/helpspot/index.php?pg=request">through our website</a>, via email to <a title="Send an
    email to Pobox Support" href="mailto:pobox@pobox.com">pobox@pobox.com</a>,
