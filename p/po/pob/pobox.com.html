<title>Pobox User Agreement</title>
<!--<h2>Pobox.com and Listbox.com Privacy Policy</h2>-->
<p>
This policy covers how IC Group treats personal information
that we collect and receive through our Pobox.com and
Listbox.com web sites.  Personal information is information
about you that is personally identifiable, such as your
name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is
not otherwise publicly available. 
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h4>Your Personal Information</h4>
<p>
When you register with us, we ask for your name, mailing
address, telephone numbers, and a security question of your
choosing.  We collect, store, and use this personal
information to confirm your identity when you contact us,
and to contact you regarding your account.  We also use
cookies as described below.
</p><p>
If you do not provide that information accurately, you reduce our
ability to confirm your identity as the account holder.  If you feel
very strongly about this matter, we urge you to fill in the security
question and answer (in <a href="http://pobox.com/login/personal/question">the Personal
Information section of the User's Area</a>) and to <i>remember the
answer</i>.  IC Group is not liable for any changes made to your
account as a result of our inability to confirm your identity.
</p><p>
Because we do not derive income from advertising, we do not
aggregate your personal information for marketing purposes.
However, we may use your data to determine some basic 
information about our user base (for example, how many
customers do we have in a particular country.)
</p><p>
We do not sell, loan, lease, give away, share or in any
other way make your personal information or your Pobox
address available to parties other than IC Group,
Inc. and its affiliates, except:
</p><ul>
<li>when you have given us permission (example: to deal
with another company on your behalf);
</li><li>when you have violated our <a href="user_agreement.html">Terms of Service</a>, and
       misused your Pobox account for spam or other
       prohibited uses;

</li><li>in the event of a merger or a transfer of all or
       substantially all our assets to a third party,
       provided that we will notify you before personal
       information becomes subject to a different privacy
       policy; and

</li><li>to comply with law or legal process (subpoenas), or
       to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend
       against legal claims.

</li></ul>
If your information has been subpoenaed from us, you will be
informed unless we are specifically barred from doing so by
the subpoena.
<p>
</p><h4>Accessing and Changing Your Account Information</h4>
<p>
You can access and edit your account information at any time (in fact,
we encourage you to keep this information up to date, so that we do
not we try to call you and find the phone number disconnected).  Your
personal information can be edited at <a href="https://www.pobox.com/login/personal">the Personal Information section of the User's Area.</a>
</p><p>
Your account can be canceled at any time by responding to
invoices with "cancel", or by contacting our Customer
Service staff at <a href="mailto:pobox@pobox.com">pobox@pobox.com</a>.  
If you ask us to delete
your account, your account will usually be deactivated and
deleted from our user registration database within 1 hour.
Please note that information may remain in back-up storage
for some further period of time.
</p><p>
</p><h4>Security</h4>
<p>
We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to
protect personal information about you; however we cannot
guarantee that someone won't be able to circumvent these
safeguards.  These safeguards include, but are not limited
to, mandating password protection for all accounts,
confirming that a request to send personal information or
passwords to email addresses not listed in an account was
submitted by a person authorized to do so for that account,
encrypting credit card and password information within our
system, and taking measures to protect our servers,
databases and other system components against intrusions,
tampering, and other attacks.
</p><p>
</p><h4>Advertising</h4>
<p>
We do not sell advertising space on any of our websites.
You may see notices about our own products, but we do not
use your eyeballs to make money.
</p><p>

We also do not distribute ads by email, either to Pobox subscribers or
through our mailing lists.  We do not even tell you about our own
products, unless you have asked us to, or there is a change that will
affect, or has affected, your service (recent examples include the
@Home outage and changes to SMTP service).

</p><p>
</p><h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>
We <i>do</i> use cookies.  Why?  It's the simplest way,
technically, to allow you to use our website.  We know that
it would be possible to run the site without cookies, but it
is a needless complication.  Here's what our cookies do: 

</p><ul>
      If you check the box that says "Remember my username
      in the future", we put a cookie on your machine that
      does exactly that.  It doesn't expire, because it
      would be useless if it did.
<p>
      If you don't check that box, you will get a cookie
      once your password has been authorized.  It will
      authorize your browser to make changes to your account
      for up to an hour, at which point it will expire.
</p></ul>

We do not issue third-party cookies.  You will most likely
receive cookies from one of these 3 domains: pobox.com,
listbox.com and icgroup.com (our parent company.)
<p>
</p><h4>Customer Service and System Maintenance</h4>
<p>

All messages sent to our customer service department are
saved indefinitely, and become our property.  If you contact
Customer Service, we reserve the right to change your
account settings or send email to your account in order to
solve the problem.  You may also receive test emails if we
detect a problem with your account, even if you have not
contacted us.
</p><p>

</p><h4>Anonymity</h4>
<p>
Pobox.com is not an anonymous remailer.  Your forwarding
address may be revealed to your correspondents through
bounce messages.  
</p><p>
</p><h4>Ownership Issues</h4>
<p>
All data, including emails, list content, subscriber lists
and any list information disseminated through the Pobox.com
or Listbox.com services, is the express property of the
account owner and/or the author of a particular message.
</p><p>
</p><h4>List Privacy</h4>
<p>
We do not make any information about our lists public.
There is no system-wide database of lists.  We do not
provide listnames to people making inquiries.  All of our
privacy policies apply to your list subscribers as well as
yourself.
</p><p>

</p><h4>Information We Store</h4>
<p>
We do not store Pobox messages coming through our servers.
Once we receive a message, we immediately attempt to process
it, and send it to your forwarding address.  We will keep
that message in the following cases:
</p><ul>    
<li>There is a problem with your forwarding address.
      We will attempt to resend the message for a maximum of
      5 days.
</li><li>You have set your email or spam filters to discard the
      message.  We will keep the message for 2 weeks, in
      case you discarded something you wanted.  Discards may
      also be used to tune the spam filters.
</li><li>List messages are kept for up to 3 months, or up to 50
      messages, whichever is higher, in order to provide a
      thorough archive for debugging problems.
</li></ul>

<h4>Children</h4>
<p>
Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to hold
Pobox.com accounts and should not submit any personal
information to us.
</p><p>

</p><h4>Changes to the Policy</h4>
<p>

We reserve the right to update this privacy policy.  If there are
material changes, we will either notify you via e-mail or post
notification prominently on our web site prior to implementing the
changes.  If you would like to receive notice via email, please go to
<a href="https://www.pobox.com/login/personal">the Personal Information section of the User's Area</a>, and specify that you
would like to receive announcements from us.

</p><p>

</p><h4>Contact Us</h4>
<p>
If you have any questions about our privacy policy, or there
are any categories that you think we haven't covered, please
let us know.  We have tried to be as comprehensive as possible,
but we'd like to know if we've missed anything.  You can
contact us <a href="/contact_us">through our website</a>, via email to <a href="mailto:pobox@pobox.com">pobox@pobox.com</a>, or send us paper mail at
