<img src="../images/space.gif" height="6" border="0"><br>

	pogo.com realizes that privacy on the Internet is a great concern to many people. 
	We want to ensure our users that pogo.com will not willfully disclose any specific 
	individual information about its members (including e-mail addresses) 
	to any third party unless they give 
	us their express permission (by claiming a prize, for example).
	<p>

	This Privacy Statement is intended to clarify how we collect information and what we 
	do with that information once we get it. It also provides information on how to "opt out" 
	of any information you've already provided us.
	</p><p>
	
	<font face="arial,helvetica" color="9999cc" size="3"><b>Children's Privacy Policy</b></font><br>
	pogo.com is not directed at children under the age of 13. 
	Users must be 13 years of age or older to register for pogo.com. In order to comply with the 
	<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1999/9910/childfinal.htm" target="_new">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998</a>, 
	pogo.com will not accept registrations from users who are 12 and under. 
	Users who are currently 13 years of age or older may register normally.
	</p><p>

	After April 20, 2000, pogo.com will not knowingly collect any information, including demographic data or other 
	personally identifiable data, from users aged 12 and under. If a child sends 
	feedback or e-mail to pogo.com, their contact information will be used only to 
	respond to their question or request. pogo.com does not distribute any information 
	or data on children to any third parties. pogo.com does not allow children to 
	publicly post or distribute any personally identifiable information to others.
	</p><p>

	If you have questions about our children's policy, you can contact us at 
	<a href="mailto:customersupport@pogo.com">customersupport@pogo.com</a>.
	</p><p>

<!--<font face="arial,helvetica" color=" mConstProps.subheadTextColor " size=3><b>TRUSTe Certification</b></font><br>
	This overall privacy statement verifies that pogo.com is
	a member of the TRUSTe program and is in compliance with TRUSTe privacy principles. This 
	statement discloses the privacy practices for all pogo.com-hosted sites (with the pogo.com domain).
	<p>

	<i>Note: Since pogo.com provides Java-based online games to a number of other Web sites, 
	it may not be readily apparent that pogo.com's games are an adjunct to the main site and 
	run completely independently from the main site you are viewing. This Privacy Policy 
	is only applicable to the online games portion of the Web site you are viewing (in 
	the pogo.com domain) and may or may not apply to our partners' site(s). Please see our 
	partners' individual privacy policies for complete details.</i>
	<p>

	TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust 
	and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. 
	Because this site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to 
	disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance 
	by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe mark, this Web site has agreed to notify you of:

	<li>What organization is collecting the information
	<li>How the information is used
	<li>With whom the information may be shared

	of information under the company's control
	<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

	If you have questions or concerns regarding this Web site's privacy statement, you should 
	first contact the company at (<a href="mailto:customersupport@pogo.com">customersupport@pogo.com</a>.).

	<font face="arial,helvetica" color="9999cc" size="3"><b>Information pogo.com gathers and tracks</b></font><br>
	pogo.com collects information from its users in the form of general demographic data and 
	occasionally specific personal information. The aggregate demographic and tracking information 
	we collect is sometimes shared with our advertisers, partners and sponsors. Specific personal 
	information is collected only when a player wins one of our optional prize-based games 
	(e.g., Bingo). Under the conditions of winning a prize, users must agree to guidelines that 
	allow us to use their name, likeness and other information for promotional material.
	</p><p>
	
	<b>Registration process</b><br>
	Our site's registration form requires new users to provide a "screen name" (their "handle" 
	or moniker on our system) and contact information in the form of their e-mail address. 
	We also require new users to enter general demographic information, including U.S. zip code, year of birth, gender, and country. 
	</p><p>

	During the registration process, the user has the option to choose to receive our promotional e-mail 
	mailings and those of selected companies we do business with. Users can, at a future date, 
	choose to unsubscribe to this e-mail list through instructions contained in the mailing or through the pogo.com client.
	</p><p>

	This demographic information collected during registration is occasionally shared in aggregate 
	form with our advertisers, partners and sponsors.
	</p><p>

	<b>Web site tracking data</b><br>
	We use "cookies" (see definition below) and other methods to monitor our Web site usage. 
	This traffic data is collected in an aggregate form and used by our marketing team in the 
	following ways: to determine high-traffic areas of our site, to locate areas of improvement 
	to our service, to judge how well certain games are received, to select additional, similar 
	games for our service and in other marketing-related tasks. We also collect information on 
	the "stickiness" of certain Web pages and our site in general and share this data with 
	third parties.
	</p><p>

	No personally-identifiable information is used in this tracking procedure and thus personal 
	information is not shared with any third parties.
	</p><p>

	<b>Feedback and bug reporting</b><br>
	Members have the option to provide us with Web-based feedback and also to report bugs 
	(defects) in our games. The feedback and bug reports are read by a subset of pogo.com's employees, 
	including, but not limited to, our Customer Service department. Important feedback/bug reports 
	are forwarded to the appropriate department in our company (engineering, marketing, etc.). 
	Both the feedback and bug reporting sections ask for the user's screen name and an e-mail 
	address. The e-mail address may be used in case we need further information about a reported 
	bug or for other feedback-related purposes, and will not be distributed to any third parties. Any personal information included in the feedback and bug reports is not recorded or saved in our database.
	</p><p>

	Our feedback section is designed to be used in a number of ways. Users can report on abusive 
	players (which are identified by their screen name), request features or games to our service, 
	pass along compliments or gripes, and enter various other comments.
	</p><p>

	Bug reports are entered by our users and contain information on the following: problems with our 
	sign on process, problems with a specific game, browser issues and compatibility problems, and 
	other miscellaneous problems.
	</p><p>

	Feedback and bug reports, and the aggregate data therein, are primarily gathered for our 
	internal use only and are not directly distributed (except in aggregate form upon request) 
	to any third parties.
	</p><p>

	<b>Member surveys</b><br>
	We occasionally run marketing-driven surveys on our site. These surveys are used to fully 
	understand our audience, to provide better service, as a factor in determining new features 
	and games to add to our service and to collect more specific aggregate demographic 
	information. These surveys are always optional to the user.
	</p><p>

	Data collected from member surveys are used by our marketing department and occasionally 
	shared in aggregate form with our advertisers and sponsors. No personally-identifiable 
	information is ever disclosed to a third party as part of our member surveys.
	</p><p>

	<b>Prizes and verification information</b><br>
	Some of pogo.com's games reward successful players with prizes that can take the form of cash 
	(Bingo is a prime example of this prize system) or other miscellaneous prizes. These prizes 
	are only eligible to certain residents of the United States and Canada (excluding Quebec) 
	that are 18 years of age or more. See the 
	<a href="prizerules.html">Prize Rules</a> for complete details.
	</p><p>

	Cash prizes require the collection of specific personal individual information for income 
	tax purposes. This specific information includes: full legal name, complete address 
	(city, state, country and zip/postal code), a social security number (social 
	insurance number in Canada) and date of birth. All information must be completed in full 
	as described in our Affidavit of Eligibility and must be accurate in order to receive a 
	prize. If this information is not collected and verified, the prize will not be awarded.
	</p><p>

	pogo.com also reserves the right to use the collected personal information in advertising, 
	promotional and/or marketing materials as described in the Liability and Publicity 
	release on our secure Web-based prize claim form.
	</p><p>

	Games where prizes are awarded are not a required part of our service. Thus, the personal 
	information provided to us through our prize claim form is the result of a completely 
	voluntary action in playing the prize-based games. If the user so desires, they can play any games with a prize component and choose to with-hold their personal information (thus forfeiting the prize). 
	</p><p>

	<b>Miscellaneous information gathered and/or tracked</b><br>
	In addition to the above-listed data that we collect or track, we also display some 
	non-personally identifiable data. These items consist of player rating information 
	(your skill level and ranking on a particular game), any prize winnings, and player 
	game statistics (number of games played, wins and losses, etc.). In the cases stated 
	on the previous line, only a player's screen name (their chosen "handle") will be 
	displayed, and no personally-identifiable information will be shown.
	</p><p>

	<b>Why we collect (and distribute) aggregate information</b><br>
	Because pogo.com derives its revenue primarily from advertisers, partners and sponsors, 
	providing demographic aggregate data from registration, surveys and the like is crucial 
	to our business strategy and to keeping our service free for our members. We provide 
	this aggregate data to our advertisers so that they can better understand our membership 
	and create better offers to our membership.
	</p><p>

	In addition, this aggregate data is used internally by our marketing and engineering groups 
	to find ways to improve our service and provide a better user experience to our members.
	</p><p>

	<font face="arial,helvetica" color="9999cc" size="3"><b>"Cookies" and their uses</b></font><br>
	This site uses small data files called "cookies" that are created and then stored on 
	a user's hard drive. These cookie files can contain information such as screen names 
	and passwords, demographic information as well as tracking data. These cookies only 
	contain information that you provide in some manner. Our cookies cannot read any 
	information, personal or otherwise, from your hard drive and cannot read cookies 
	created by other Web sites.
	</p><p>

	<b>Accepting cookies</b><br>
	You should have your Web browser set up to accept cookies, or you may be unable to play 
	games on our system. A browser's initial configuration is to allow cookies, but if 
	you've adjusted your browser settings to warn you before accepting cookies, you will 
	receive a warning message each time we send (or check) a cookie to your computer.
	</p><p>

	<b>Why do we use cookies on our site?</b><br>
	We use cookies on our pages for a variety of purposes. In some cases, our cookies 
	store your screen and password so that you don't have to sign on to our service again 
	(as long as you're using the same computer) since cookies are stored on your computer, 
	not ours. We also use them to track the number of page views and the "stickiness" on 
	those pages. In addition, we store our system's "preference" information in cookies 
	(saving such things as screen size, "friends lists" and other non-personally-identifiable 
	information). We encrypt these cookies for added security.
	</p><p>

	<b>Advertisers and their cookies</b><br>
	Our sponsors and advertisers may use cookies within their advertisements or promotions 
	that could potentially collect information about you or your Web usage. pogo.com does not 
	control this flow of information and it may be difficult to discern which cookies are 
	coming from our site and which are coming from our advertisers. We try to ensure that 
	our advertisers and sponsors adhere to our privacy practices, but if you have any 
	concerns about the information they may be gathering, it's best if you contact those 
	advertisers directly.
	</p><p>

	DoubleClick and other companies may serve the ads that appear on the pogo.com network 
	of sites. These companies may also place cookies on a user's hard drive in order to 
	target ads to that user or for other purposes. For more information about DoubleClick's 
	privacy policy, and for information on opting in or out of Doubleclick's cookie placement, 
	please visit <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com:8080/privacy_policy/" target="_new">DoubleClick's website</a>.
	</p><p>

	<font face="arial,helvetica" color="9999cc" size="3"><b>Use of public chat rooms</b></font><br>
	As part of pogo.com's gaming service, we provide areas where players can engage in public chat. 
	Users in these chat rooms are identified solely by their user-created screen names on our 
	service. Please remember that any information you disclose within these forums becomes 
	public knowledge. Users should never disclose any personal information in these areas. pogo.com is not responsible for any knowledge you choose to disclose. 
	</p><p>

	<!--

	These chat rooms/lobbies are accessible to children under 13 years of age, therefore 
	personal information could be disclosed by these minors with direct parental authority. 
	Because of this, the TRUSTe guidelines are not being met by this site. 
	[ Jim, is this true? -Robert ] We highly recommend parents and guardians instruct their 
	children on the use of chat rooms and forums and spend as much time with their children 
	as necessary to ensure their safety and knowledge of these areas.
	<p>

	-->

	<font face="arial,helvetica" color="9999cc" size="3"><b>Opt-out policy</b></font><br>
	pogo.com provides its players with choices of whether to divulge demographic or 
	personally-identifiable information wherever possible. In some cases (see "Prize and 
	verification information" above), personal information must be collected. In cases like 
	these, the option is always there to not participate in those areas.
	</p><p>

	During the registration process, users can opt to not receive our e-mail newsletter 
	and opt to provide a false e-mail address rather than their proper one. However, 
	providing a false e-mail address will make that user ineligible to claim and collect 
	prizes from our games and contests that award them. The user has the option to change 
	their e-mail address after registration, if they choose to do so.
	</p><p>

	If you have questions about our opt-out policy, you can contact us at 
	<a href="mailto:customersupport@pogo.com">customersupport@pogo.com</a>.
	</p><p>

	<font face="arial,helvetica" color="9999cc" size="3"><b>Correction/update information</b></font><br>
	We provide the ability to change certain aspects of your user profile and preference 
	settings. Specifically, we give the user the chance (after registration) to change their 
	e-mail address, screen size preference, "friends lists" and other preference data stored 
	on our computers or through cookies on your computer.
	</p><p>

	If you have questions about how to correct or update your user information, or if you 
	want to adjust demographic information not mentioned above, please contact us at 
	<a href="mailto:customersupport@pogo.com">customersupport@pogo.com</a>.
	</p><p>

	<font face="arial,helvetica" color="9999cc" size="3"><b>Cancelling your account</b></font><br>
	Currently, there is no way to cancel your account with us. However, there is no 
	penalty for leaving your account dormant, since we will not delete it automatically.
	</p><p>

	You can, however, remove yourself from our electronic-based newsletters by following 
	the unsubscribe information contained in our newsletters.
	</p><p>
