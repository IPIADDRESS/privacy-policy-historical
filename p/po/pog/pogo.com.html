	<span class="bodygreen">pogo.com's Privacy Statement</span><br>
	</p><p>
	pogo.com realizes that privacy on the Internet is a great concern to many people. 
	We want to assure our members that pogo.com will not willfully disclose personally 
	identifiable information about a member (for example, name, home address or e-mail address) 
	to any third party without the consent of the member, except in the limited circumstances 
	specifically detailed below.
	</p><p>
	This Privacy Statement is intended to clarify (1) why we collect information about our 
	members; (2) what types of information we collect; (3) how we collect that information and 
	(4) what we do with that information once we receive it.  This Statement also provides information 
	on how you can "opt out" of certain services offered by pogo.com and its partners and sponsors, 
	including e-mail updates and offers.  By using the services provided by pogo.com, you agree, 
	without limitation or qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Statement, as it may be updated 
	from time to time.
	</p><p>
	pogo.com reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time, but our website will state 
	when changes have been made, and in addition, will state the date it was last updated. We 
	encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you use this website to make sure you 
	understand how your information will be used.
	</p><p>

	<span class="bodygreen">Why does pogo.com collect information about its members?</span><br>
	</p><p>
	We collect information about our members in order to understand who plays our games so that we can 
	improve our service, customize the user experience and provide advertising and sponsorships that 
	are more likely to be of interest to you.  Our ability to present more relevant and interesting 
	advertising also helps improve your experience on pogo.com. We collect information from our users 
	and provide it in an aggregated form to our advertisers and partners so that they can better 
	understand our base of members and create better offerings for you.  We do not share individual 
	personally identifiable information with advertisers or partners without the member's consent. 
	Because we derive most of our revenue from advertising and sponsorships, collecting and analyzing 
	user data is crucial to our ability to keep our games free to members.
	</p><p>

	<span class="bodygreen">What types of information does pogo.com collect?</span><br>
	</p><p>
	When you register or claim prizes on pogo.com, we generally collect two types of information from 
	you: general demographic data (for example, year of birth, gender, ZIP code and country) and 
	personally identifiable information (for example, your e-mail address, name and home address). 
	Whenever we collect personally identifiable information, we make an effort to include a link to 
	this Privacy Statement on that page. We do not share any member's personally identifiable 
	information with third parties without the member's consent.
	</p><p>
	We also offer members the ability to register for other related services from our site (for 
	example, MyPoints).  If you opt in to any of these services, we may collect additional information 
	requested by a service provider and pass this information, together with all other registration 
	information (including personally identifiable information), to that service provider.  Use of 
	your information by a service provider will be governed by the terms of service (including the 
	privacy statement) of that service provider. Pogo may also retain any additional information 
	collected for use in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement.  Participation in these 
	other related services is optional and is not required to play games on pogo.com.
	</p><p>
	We also conduct surveys of our members from time to time to better understand our community and 
	provide better service to our members.  Participation in user surveys is always voluntary, and no 
	personally identifiable information collected from these surveys is disclosed to third parties 
	without the member's consent.
	</p><p>
	In addition, when a member spends time on the pogo.com site, we and our partners may also collect 
	information about the member's use of the pogo.com site, including games played, time spent 
	playing our games and which ads or links are clicked.  In addition, DoubleClick, the company that 
	serves many of the ads that appear on the pogo.com site, may also collect information regarding 
	your activities online, including the sites you visit.  Other ad serving companies may also 
	collect similar information. For more information on DoubleClick's services and how you can opt 
	out of those services, please visit <a href="http://www.DoubleClick.com:8080/privacy_policy/">DoubleClick's website</a>
	For more information about the 
	practices of some of the other large ad serving companies that may collect information on your 
	use of the site, you may visit <a href="http://www.adknowledge.com/privacy/index.html">AdKnowledge</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.avenuea.com/info/privacy.asp">Avenue A</a> and <a href="http://www.mediaplex.com/mp/privacy/privacy_f.html">MediaPlex</a> 
	to view their privacy statements and opt out policies.
	</p><p>
	We and the ad serving companies may also collect information about the type of browsers our 
	members use, the IP address of people who access our site, and the URL or the website from which 
	a member comes to the pogo.com site.
	</p><p>

	<span class="bodygreen">How does pogo.com collect this information?</span><br>
	</p><p>
	<b>Registration process</b><br>
	The pogo.com registration form requires a new member to provide a "screen name" (a "handle" or 
	moniker by which he or she will be known on our service) and contact information in the form of 
	an e-mail address. We also require a new user to enter general demographic information, including 
	ZIP code, year and month of birth, gender, and country.
	</p><p>
	During the registration process, you have the option to choose to receive our promotional e-mail 
	and those of selected partners we do business with.  You can, at any time, choose to unsubscribe from 
	these e-mail lists by following the instructions contained in the e-mails. 
	</p><p>
	<b>Member surveys</b><br>
	We occasionally run marketing surveys on our site. These surveys are used to fully understand our 
	audience, to provide better service, as a factor in determining new features and games to add to 
	our service and to collect more specific aggregate demographic information. Participation in these 
	surveys is always optional.
	</p><p>
	Data collected from member surveys are used by our marketing department and occasionally shared in 
	aggregate form with our advertisers and sponsors.  We may also use a member's survey data to 
	direct advertising that is more likely to be of interest to the member.  No member's personally 
	identifiable information is disclosed to a third party as part of our member surveys without the 
	member's consent.
	</p><p>
	<b>Prizes and verification information</b><br>
	Some of pogo.com's games reward successful players with prizes that can take the form of cash or 
	other prizes.  Only certain residents of the United States and Canada (excluding Quebec) who are 
	18 years of age or more are eligible to receive prizes, and all prize programs are void where 
	prohibited by law.  See the <a href="prizerules.html">Prize Rules</a> 
	for complete details. 
	</p><p>
	In order to award cash and other prizes, we must collect specific personally identifiable 
	information for income tax purposes.  This specific information includes: full legal name, 
	complete address (city, state, country and zip/postal code), a social security number (social 
	insurance number in Canada) and date of birth. All information must be completed in full as 
	described in our Affidavit of Eligibility and must be accurate in order to receive a prize. If 
	this information is not collected and verified, the prize will not be awarded.
	</p><p>
	If you win a prize, pogo.com reserves the right to use your name, city and state and other 
	information (excluding your social security number) in advertising, promotional and/or marketing 
	materials as described in the Liability and Publicity Release on our web-based prize claim form.
	</p><p>
	Participation in games with a prize component is strictly voluntary and is not a required part of 
	our service.  We only request personally identifiable information on the prize claim form and 
	Affidavit of Eligibility if a member has voluntarily chosen to play our prize-based games. Any 
	member may play prize-based games, but in order to collect any prize associated with those games, 
	the member must provide the information requested. Alternatively, the member may elect not to play 
	those games or may decline any prizes awarded in those games.
	</p><p>
	<b>website usage data</b><br>
	We use "cookies" (see definition below) and other methods to monitor our website usage.  This 
	traffic data is collected as you use our service and is used primarily by our marketing group.  We 
	collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games and which 
	ads or links are clicked.  We also share this aggregate data with third parties.  No personally 
	identifiable information is collected or shared with third parties through cookies.
	</p><p>
	DoubleClick, the company that serves the ads that appear on the pogo.com site, may also collect 
	information regarding your activities on pogo.com, including the ads you click on and the other 
	sites you visit.  For more information on DoubleClick's services and how you can opt out of those 
	services, please visit <a href="http://www.DoubleClick.com:8080/privacy_policy/">DoubleClick's website</a>.
	</p><p>

	<span class="bodygreen">How do we use the information we collect?</span><br>
	</p><p>
	<b>How we may use and disclose aggregate demographic information</b><br>
	The aggregate demographic information we collect from our members is shared with our advertisers, 
	partners and sponsors to help them understand the types of people who play our games.  This 
	information helps us to sell advertisements and promotions and helps keep our games available to 
	you for free.
	</p><p>
	<b>How we may use and disclose non-personally identifiable information</b><br>
	During the registration process, each member is asked to provide his or her year of birth, gender, 
	ZIP code and country.  In marketing surveys, we may request additional information, including 
	household income, education level, type of employment, hobbies and other types of information.  
	This information may be used by pogo.com to select and direct advertising that is more likely to 
	be of interest to a particular member. This information is transmitted to an ad server owned by 
	DoubleClick to match members with ads that they are more likely to be interested in.  We do not 
	disclose any member's personally identifiable information to our advertisers without the member's 
	consent.  Participation in member surveys is entirely optional.
	</p><p>
	In addition, DoubleClick may use information regarding your activities on pogo.com and other web 
	sites (including search terms, ads you click on and sites you visit online) to create more 
	detailed user profiles.  These profiles are not associated with any personally identifiable 
	information, but are used by DoubleClick and its partners (including pogo.com) to understand 
	members and to direct advertising that is more relevant to you. For more information on 
	DoubleClick's services and how you can opt out of those services, please visit 
	<a href="http://www.DoubleClick.com:8080/privacy_policy/">DoubleClick's website</a>.
	</p><p>
	<b>How we may use and disclose personally identifiable information:</b><br>
	<b>A:</b> <u>E-mail promotions and offers from pogo.com and our partners.</u>  During the registration process, you 
	may choose to receive promotional e-mail from pogo.com and selected partners we do business with. 
	If you do not opt out of the pogo.com e-mail information, or if you opt in to the other promotions 
	and offers, we will use your e-mail address to send you the pogo.com newsletter and updates and to 
	send you information on products or services from our selected partners and sponsors. You can, at 
	any time, choose to unsubscribe from these e-mail lists by following the instructions contained in 
	the e-mails.  We also offer members the ability to register for other related services from our 
	site (for example, MyPoints).  If you opt in to any of these services, we may collect additional 
	information requested by a service provider and pass this information, together with all other 
	registration information (including personally identifiable information), to that service provider. 
	Use of your information by a service provider will be governed by the terms of service (including 
	the privacy statement) of that service provider.  We may also retain any additional information 
	collected for use in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement.  Participation in these 
	other related services is optional and is not required to play games on pogo.com.
	</p><p>
	<b>B:</b> <u>Prize distribution and promotion.</u>  The payment of prizes requires that pogo.com collect specific 
	personally identifiable information for income tax and other purposes.  This information includes: 
	full legal name, complete address (city, state, country and zip/postal code), a social security 
	number (social insurance number in Canada) and date of birth. In order to claim a prize, a winning 
	player must provide all information requested in the Affidavit of Eligibility.  If a player does 
	not provide complete and accurate information, or if pogo.com is unable to verify the accuracy of 
	the information, pogo.com will not award the prize to the player.
	</p><p>
	If a player wins a prize, pogo.com reserves the right to use the player's personal information, 
	including a player's name, city, state and other information (excluding social security number) 
	in advertising, promotional and/or marketing materials as described in the Liability and Publicity 
	Release on our secure web-based prize claim form.  Games with prizes are not a required part of 
	the pogo.com service.  Thus, the personally identifiable information provided to us through our 
	prize claim form is the result of a voluntary choice to play the prize-based games.  Any member 
	may play prize-based games, but in order to collect any prize associated with those games, the 
	member must provide the information requested.  Alternatively, the member may elect not to play 
	those games or may decline any prizes awarded in those games.
	</p><p>
	<b>C:</b> <u>Legal process and protection of pogo.com and our members.</u> In certain cases, we 
	may disclose your personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that the 
	disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference to pogo.com's 
	rights, property, operations or users or to others who may be harmed by such activities.
	We may also disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe that the law requires 
	disclosure or in response to a demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal 
	investigation or by civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or 
	administrative action.
	</p><p>
	<b>Website usage data</b><br>
	We use "cookies" (see definition below) and other methods to monitor our website usage.  This 
	data is collected in an aggregate form and used by our marketing team in the following ways: to 
	determine high-traffic areas of our site, to locate areas of improvement to our service, to judge 
	how well certain games are received, to select additional, similar games for our service and in 
	other marketing-related tasks. We also collect information on the amount of time spent by users 
	(or "stickiness") on certain web pages and our site in general and share this data with third 
	parties.  No personally identifiable information is collected or shared with third parties through 
	cookies. We also use the data collected through cookies to determine which ads are more likely to 
	be of interest to a member and to direct those ads accordingly.
	</p><p>
	<b>Feedback and bug reporting information</b><br>
	Members have the option to provide us with web-based feedback and also to report bugs (defects) 
	in our games.  Both the feedback and bug reporting sections ask for the user's screen name and an 
	e-mail address.  The feedback and bug reports are read by a subset of pogo.com's employees, 
	including, but not limited to, our Customer Service department. Important feedback/bug reports are 
	forwarded to the appropriate department in our company (engineering, marketing, etc.). The e-mail 
	address of the member may be used in case we need further information about a reported bug or for 
	other feedback-related purposes, and will not be distributed to any third parties. Any personal 
	information included in the feedback and bug reports is not recorded or saved in our database.
	</p><p>
 	<b>Miscellaneous information gathered and/or tracked</b><br>
	In addition to the above-listed data that we collect or track, we also display some non-personally 
	identifiable data. These items consist of player rating information (your skill level and ranking 
	on a particular game), any prize winnings, and player game statistics (number of games played, 
	wins and losses, etc.). In the cases stated in the previous sentence, only a player's screen name 
	(his or her chosen "handle") will be displayed, and no personally identifiable information will be 
	shown. 
	</p><p>

	<span class="bodygreen">How does pogo.com protect children's privacy?</span><br>
	</p><p>
	pogo.com is not directed at children under the age of 13.  In order to comply with the 
	<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1999/9910/childfinal.htm">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998</a>, 
	pogo.com will not accept registrations from users who are 
	12 and under. Users who are currently 13 years of age or older may register normally. 
	</p><p>
	After April 20, 2000, pogo.com will not knowingly collect any information, including demographic 
	data or other personally identifiable data, from users aged 12 and under. If a child under 13 
	sends feedback or e-mail to pogo.com, the contact information will be used only to respond to the 
	specific question or request. pogo.com does not knowingly distribute any information or data 
	collected from children under 13 to any third parties.  pogo.com does not knowingly allow children 
	under 13 to publicly post or distribute any personally identifiable information to others on the 
	pogo.com site. 
	</p><p>
	If parents have any questions about our policy with respect to children's privacy on our site, 
	you can contact us at <a href="mailto:customersupport@pogo.com">customersupport@pogo.com</a>. 
	</p><p>

	<span class="bodygreen">What are "cookies" and how are they used?</span><br>
	</p><p>
	This site uses small data files called "cookies" that are created and then stored on a user's hard 
	drive. These cookie files can contain information such as screen names and passwords, demographic 
	information as well as tracking data. These cookies only contain information that you provide in 
	some manner. Our cookies cannot read any information, personal or otherwise, from your hard drive 
	and cannot read cookies created by other websites. 
	</p><p>
	<b>Accepting cookies</b><br>
	You should have your web browser set up to accept cookies, or you may be unable to play games on 
	our system. A browser's initial configuration is to allow cookies, but if you've adjusted your 
	browser settings to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive a warning message each 
	time we send (or check) a cookie to your computer. 
	</p><p>
	<b>Why do we use cookies on our site?</b><br>
	We use cookies on our pages for a variety of purposes. In some cases, our cookies store your screen and 
	password so that you don't have to sign on to our service again (as long as you're using the same 
	computer) since cookies are stored on your computer, not ours. We also use them to track the number 
	of page views and the "stickiness" on those pages. In addition, we store our system's "preference" 
	information in cookies (saving such things as screen size, "friends lists" and other 
	non-personally identifiable information). We encrypt these cookies for added security. 
	</p><p>
	<b>Advertisers and their cookies</b><br>
	Our sponsors and advertisers may use cookies within their advertisements or promotions that could 
	potentially collect information about you or your web usage. pogo.com does not control this flow 
	of information and it may be difficult to discern which cookies are coming from our site and which 
	are coming from our advertisers. We try to ensure that our advertisers and sponsors adhere to our 
	privacy practices, but if you have any concerns about the information they may be gathering, it's 
	best if you contact those advertisers directly. 
	</p><p>
	DoubleClick and other companies may serve the ads that appear on the pogo.com network of sites. 
	These companies may also place cookies on a member's hard drive in order to target ads to that 
	member or to collect other information about a member's online activities, including other sites 
	visited.  For more information about DoubleClick's privacy policy, and for information on opting 
	out of DoubleClick's services, please visit <a href="http://www.DoubleClick.com:8080/privacy_policy/">DoubleClick's website</a>. 
	For more information about the 
	practices of some of the other large ad serving companies that may collect information on your 
	use of the site, you may visit <a href="http://www.adknowledge.com/privacy/index.html">AdKnowledge</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.avenuea.com/info/privacy.asp">Avenue A</a> and <a href="http://www.mediaplex.com/mp/privacy/privacy_f.html">MediaPlex</a> 
	to view their privacy statements and opt out policies.  	
	</p><p>

	<span class="bodygreen">What happens to information disclosed in public chat rooms?</span><br>
	</p><p>
	As part of pogo.com's gaming service, we provide areas where players can engage in public chat. 
	Members using these chat rooms are identified solely by their user-created screen names. Please 
	remember that any information you disclose within these forums becomes public knowledge.  Use of 
	the chat rooms is strictly voluntary, and members should never disclose any personal information 
	in these areas.  pogo.com is not responsible for any information you choose to disclose.
	</p><p>

	<span class="bodygreen">What is the opt-out policy for pogo.com?</span><br>
	</p><p>
	During the registration process, each member is asked to provide his or her year of birth, gender, 
	ZIP code and country, as well as a valid e-mail address.  This information is required in order to 
	play most of the games on our site.  We do not monitor the validity of the information you provide 
	unless you become entitled to a prize, in which case we require a valid e-mail address, mailing 
	address and tax identification number for prize confirmation and fulfillment.  A member who does 
	not wish to disclose this additional information may still play our games, but will not be eligible 
	to receive prizes.
	</p><p>
	Members have the ability to opt out of receiving e-mail updates, newsletters and other information 
	from pogo.com, as well as direct mail offers from selected partners and sponsors.  This is done at 
	the point of initial registration to play games on our site.  All of our newsletters and direct 
	e-mail communications have easy-to-follow unsubscribe instructions at the bottom.  Members who do 
	not provide a valid e-mail address and other information will be ineligible to claim or collect 
	prizes from our games and contests. A member can change his or her e-mail address after registration.
