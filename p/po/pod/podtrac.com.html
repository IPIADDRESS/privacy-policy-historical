        are name, address, phone number, email address, etc. This information is used solely

        interested in obtaining additional information about Podtrac products and services
        may also provide personally identifiable information to Podtrac via Podtrac.com.
        This PII is only used to provide the requested information.</p>
    <p>
        Our site automatically creates logs regarding user sessions on Podtrac.com, such
        as features that you use, the actions that you take, and the information that you
        access. We generally use this information in statistical and aggregate formats to
        assess the effectiveness of our site and to better understand your priorities and
        interests.</p>
    <p>
        Podtrac does not sell, distribute or disclose your personally identifiable information
        collected via Podtrac.com to third parties without your consent, unless required
        to do so by a legal process such as a subpoena or a search warrant.</p>
    <p>
        Podtrac provides free services to podcasters whereby Podtrac gathers data specific
        to individual podcasts (e.g. audience survey data, content ratings, measurement
        data, etc). This podcast data is not considered personally identifiable information
        and may be shared by Podtrac with member advertisers.</p>
    <h3>
        Use of Cookies</h3>
    <p>
        Cookies are pieces of data stored on a user's hard drive that contain information
        about a user. To enable secure content access, we use cookies that contain encrypted
        login information so we can ensure that client-specific information is secure from
        unauthorized access. These cookies are used only for this purpose and are intended
        to be used only by our Web site. (You can view and delete these cookies using the
        features of your browser.)</p>
    <h3>
        Choice and Data Access</h3>
    <p>
        Clients who register on Podtrac.com can view and modify their profile information
        in the secure client areas of our site.</p>
    <h3>
        Data Security/Integrity</h3>
    <p>
        Podtrac employs industry standard security measures to protect the security of all
        data. Data stored on Podtrac's servers is treated as proprietary and confidential
        and is not available to the public. Only authorized employees and contractors have
        access to the personally identifiable data you provide and that access is limited
        by need. Our employees and contractors who have access to this data have agreed
        to maintain the confidentiality of this information.</p>
    <h3>
        Children</h3>
    <p>

        under 13 years of age.</p>
    <h3>
        Safe Harbor</h3>
    <p>
        The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly
        from US laws. To reconcile these differences, the US and the EU have created a Safe
        Harbor that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations. Podtrac adheres to the
        Safe Harbor principals. For more information see <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>
    <p>
        By providing information to Podtrac, you acknowledge that Podtrac operates in the
        United States, and you agree to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) permit Podtrac to transmit
        and use your user information anywhere necessary, including across international
        boundaries, to affect the services and transactions provided by this Site; and (ii)
        that such use by Podtrac shall be subject to the terms and conditions stated in
        this Privacy Statement and applicable Terms and Conditions and Policies.</p>
    <h3>
        Notification of Changes</h3>
    <p>
        If we materially change our practices in handling personally identifiable information,
        as described in this statement, we will notify you by posting the changes on this
        Privacy Statement at least 30 days prior to their implementation.</p>
