		    	<h2 class="about-header" id="about-main">podbay.fm privacy policy</h2>
		    	<h5 class="about-header" id="about-small">Web site visitor data</h5>
		    	<p>Podbay.fm routinely gathers data on Web site activity, such as how many people visit the site, the pages they visit, where they come from, how long they stay on the site, etc. The data is collected on an aggregate, anonymous basis, which means that no personally identifiable information is associated with the data. This data helps us improve site content and overall usage. The information is not shared with other organizations for their independent use.</p>	
		    	<h5 class="about-header" id="about-small">Collecting and using personal information</h5>
		    	<p>Except as disclosed in this Privacy Statement, we do not collect any identifiable information about visitors to this site or our customers who use this site. The policies, sources, and uses of information are outlined in Sections 1 through 7 that follow:</p>
		    	<h5 class="about-header" id="about-small">1. Web logs</h5>
		    	<p>We maintain standard Web logs that record data about all visitors and customers who use this site and we store this information for a while. These logs may contain the Internet domain from which you access the site (such as aol.com, abc.org, etc.); the IP address which is automatically assigned to your computer when you get on the Internet (a static IP address may be identifiable as being connected to you, while a dynamic address is usually not identifiable); the type of browser and operating system you use; the date and time you visited the site; the pages you viewed on the site; the address of the Web site you linked from, if any. If you sign on to this Web site to use its secured features, our Web logs will also contain an individual identifier and show the services you have accessed.</p><p>All Web logs are stored securely, and may only be accessed by podbay.fm staff on a need-to-know basis for a specific purpose to use web log information to help us design our site, to identify popular features, to resolve user, hardware, and software problems, and to make the site more useful to visitors.</p>
		    	<h5 class="about-header" id="about-small">2. Internet cookies</h5>
		    	<p>We may place Internet "cookies" on the computer hard drives of visitors to this Web site. Information we obtain from cookies helps us to tailor our site to be more helpful and efficient for our visitors. The cookie consists of a unique identifier that does not contain information about you</p><p>You may have software on your computer that will allow you to decline or deactivate Internet cookies, but if you do so, some features of this site may not work properly for you. For instructions on how to remove cookies from your hard drive, go to your browser's Web site for detailed instructions. In addition, further information regarding cookies may be available on other Web sites or from your Internet service provider. Firefox and Internet Explorer are two common browsers.</p>
		    	<h5 class="about-header" id="about-small">3. Web Beacons</h5>
		    	<p>We may also occasionally use "Web beacons" (also known as "clear gifs," "Web bugs," "1-pixel gifs," etc.) that allow us to collect non-personal information about your response to our e-mail communications, and for other purposes. Web beacons are tiny images, placed on a Web page or e-mail, that can tell us if you've gone to a particular area on our Web site. For example, if you've given us permission to send you e-mails, we may send you an e-mail urging you to use a certain feature on our Web site. If you do respond to that e-mail and use that feature, the Web beacon will tell us that our e-mail communication with you has been successful. We do not collect any personal health information with a Web beacon, and do not link Web beacons with any other personal health information you've given us.</p><p>Since Web beacons are used in conjunction with persistent cookies (described above), if you set your browser to decline or deactivate cookies, Web beacons cannot function.</p>
		    	<h5 class="about-header" id="about-small">4. E-mails</h5>
		    	<p>We use a third-party vendor to help us manage some of our e-mail communications with you. While we do supply this vendor with e-mail addresses of those we wish them to contact, your e-mail address is never used for any purpose other than to communicate with you on our behalf. When you click on a link in an e-mail, you may temporarily be redirected through one of the vendor's servers (although this process will be invisible to you) which will register that you've clicked on that link, and have visited our Web site. Podbay.fm never shares any information, other than your e-mail address, with our third-party e-mail vendor, which does not share these e-mail addresses with anyone else.</p><p>Even if you have given us permission to send e-mails to you, you may revoke that permission at any time by following the "unsubscribe" information at the bottom of the e-mail.</p>
		    	<h5 class="about-header" id="about-small">5. Evaluation and research</h5>
		    	<p>We will periodically ask users to complete surveys asking about their experiences with features of the Web site. Our surveys ask visitors for demographic information such as age, gender, and education, but will not request that users provide specific information about any medical condition. We use survey information for research and quality improvement purposes, including helping us to improve information and services offered through the Web site. In addition, users giving feedback may be individually contacted for follow-up due to concerns raised during the course of such evaluation. Demographic information and Web log data may be stored for future research and evaluation</p>
		    	<h5 class="about-header" id="about-small">6. Disclosures</h5>
		    	<p>We may disclose personal information to any person performing audit, legal, operational, or other services for us. We will use information which does not identify the individual for these activities whenever feasible. Information disclosed to vendors or contractors for operational purposes may not be re-disclosed to others by such a vendor or contractor.</p><p>We may disclose personal information when required to do so by a subpoena, court order, or search warrant. We may disclose personal information as we deem it appropriate to protect the safety of an individual or for an investigation related to public safety or to report an activity that appears to be in violation of law. We may disclose personal information to protect the security and reliability of this site and to take precautions against liability.</p>
		    	<h5 class="about-header" id="about-small">7. Third Party Web Sites</h5>
		    	<p>Podbay.fm collects data from third party web sites including, but not limited to Twitter.com. The use of personal data of users from Third Party Sites is restricted to necessary podbay.fm operations and is used by staff on a need-to-know basis. The use of any data derived from Third Party Web Sites will be utilized in accordance with Third Party Web Sites Terms of Services as outlined on Third Party Web Sites pages.</p>
		    	<h5 class="about-header" id="about-small">8. Opt out</h5>
		    	<p>If a user makes a request to receive information in an ongoing manner through this Web site by providing their e-mail address (for example, requesting a subscription to one of our online publications), a user may make a request to discontinue future mailings.</p>
		    	<h5 class="about-header" id="about-small">Questions, complaints, and contacts:</h5>
		    	<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, our policies and practices concerning this site, your rights under this statement, and your dealings with this Web site, you can contact podbay.fm by sending a message to info@podbay.fm.</p>
