  From time to time, Podio may introduce new products and services. To the extent that these new products and services affect this policy,
  this policy will be updated. Please see item number 5 for details on how we notify users of updates to our privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section1">1. Why is my information needed?</h2>
  <p>
  Podio products are web based; because of this they may require the use of first and last names, billing contact information, a password and a valid email address as a login. Therefore, at a minimum, we may require such necessary information in order to establish your account with us.
  </p>

  <p>

  </p>

  <h2 id="section2">2. What information does Podio gather/track and how is it used?</h2>
  <p>
  PERSONAL INFORMATION: We collect personal information from users including (at minimum) first and last names, an email address to be used as a login, and a password. When a user registers online for the free version of the service, Podio will take steps to verify the email address supplied to us to ensure it is accurate. The premium service requires Podio to collect billing contact information and a credit card number which will also be verified to ensure it is accurate. Your email address may be used to send you periodic product newsletters, offers and usage tips from Podio. You can opt out of promotional emails at any time, but will still receive communications such as receipts, confirmation emails and customer service updates that are considered necessary to provide the service to you. We use the information collected to deliver services, process payments, update our records, communicate with you about products and services, and generally maintain your accounts with us. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you services, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at support@podio.com. We do not share, sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties except as described in this privacy policy.
  Information gathered at company podio.com, our public website, is done so on a voluntary basis. You need not provide us with any personal information to use these sites. Information submitted on these sites can include contact information such as email addresses, comments on blog postings and job and press inquires. To request removal of your personal information from the Podio blog, contact us at support@podio.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
  </p>
  <p>
  In-session information collected during the use of the free or premium Podio products is protected by the use of end-to-end encryption and only accessible by the authorized account users of the workspaces. “In-session information” includes all app, task, stream and message data entered into Podio. This information is never exposed in unencrypted form during transmission across public or private networks.
  Because of our commitment to present the best possible product to all our users, we track the category of services selected by our individual users as well as all information pertaining to user satisfaction. To ensure the quality of our product, we reserve the right to maintain evaluation and feedback records.
  </p>
  <p>
  BUSINESS INFORMATION: Information that is collected by our products is considered confidential. We will not view Business Information except as necessary to appropriately support the service or as required by law. (Business Information includes app data, task data, messages, files, and any other business information stored on Podio) You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit to your Podio profile can be read, collected or used by others who share the same workspace(s) as you. We will not view Business Information, except as necessary to appropriately support the service, for the purpose of anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or resolving any problems that might limit or disrupt the quality of our customers’ service experience or as required by law. We do not build or give access to administrative tools that would allow Podio employees to view business information.
  </p>
  <p>
  PARTNERS: In some cases we provide services or sell product lines jointly with other businesses. For these co-branded offerings in which a third party is involved in your transactions, we will sometimes share or jointly collect customer information related to those transactions with that third party. On the co-branded registration pages we will state who is collecting or receiving the information and whose privacy statement governs its use so that you will know at the time you create your account exactly how your information will be used. If you are registered with Podio through a partnership and you request to opt out of receiving promotional updates we will also provide your email address to that partner so that they may also discontinue sending you messages on behalf of Podio.
  </p>
  <p>
  AFFILIATES: We may sometimes share or jointly collect information with our parent entity and the wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliated divisions of our parent company entity.
  </p>
  <p>
  SESSION RECORDS: To maintain our quality of service and to assist in the analysis of product performance, we may also gather data on connection information, including the timing and size of all packets sent over the Internet during a session. The gathered information is used only to ensure the highest quality experience possible when using Podio products.
  </p>
  <p>
  SECURITY INFORMATION: Podio also collects certain standard information about your computer for security and identification purposes. This information may include: IP addresses, domain names, access times, cookies and other unique identifying information of machines that have our software downloaded and installed on them. This information is used for the operation of the service, to identify and protect our customers and to control unauthorized use or abuse of our services. All information is encrypted during transmission and is stored securely within our servers.
  </p>
  <p>
  SURVEYS: In addition to required member information, we may conduct surveys and ask users to volunteer demographic information to be used on an aggregate basis for internal market research, presentation to advertisers and joint research projects with outside companies involved in product development. We use such information to better focus our product and personalize the scope of services offered to each individual user.
  </p>
  <p>
  WEB ANALYTICS: We continuously improve our websites and utilize different web analytic tools to help us do so. We are interested in how visitors use our websites, what they like and dislike, and where they have problems. We also use web analytic tools on our mobile applications to help gather non-personally identifiable data about download and application usage. In our use of web analytics we do collect GeoLocation data, but it is only on an aggregate basis and not tied to any individual. The web beacons used in connection with our web analytics services do not share any personally identifiable information about our website and application visitors with third parties. Our tools may gather data such as what browser a person uses, what operating systems are used, what is downloaded, and what content, products and services are reviewed when visiting or registering for services at one of our websites or mobile applications. This information is used solely to assist Podio in maintaining a more effective and useful website for our customers.
  We track aggregate traffic patterns throughout our site but we do not correlate this information with personally identifiable data about individual users. We track domain names, browser types and MIME type. Such information will not be passed to third parties without your prior consent unless where required by applicable law.
  </p>
  <p>
  COOKIES: A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns and hold certain registration information. When you register at Podio sites, we use cookies to store unique, randomly assigned user IDs that we generate for administrative purposes. These cookies enable you to enter the Podio sites without having to log on each time. We do not store passwords or any Personal Information about you in the cookies.
  </p>
  <p>
  Podio also partners with selected marketing companies to help us track the effectiveness of our websites, generate visitor traffic, and as part of our affiliate referral program through Commission Junction (http://www.cj.com). When a partner refers a visitor to us from any of these sites, they set a web beacon and a cookie on our site. An ad ID and a partner ID are stored in the cookie, but no personally identifiable information specific to the actual visitor is stored. Podio does not see the cookie; we only include the web beacon on our page, which results in a request to the partner’s servers from the customer browser. We have no control over their use of tracking technologies after they are placed on our site.
  The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can still review the website if you choose to set your browser to refuse all cookies; however, you must enable cookies in order to establish an account and to download and install any of the software.

  <h2 id="section3">3. With whom does Podio share the information?</h2>
  <p>
  Ensuring your privacy is important to us. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to third parties.
  Podio products and services by necessity require us to provide some of your information to third parties. We may occasionally employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments, sending postal mail and email, analyzing data and providing marketing assistance. They have access to personal information needed only to perform their functions and may not use it for any other purpose. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also, in the event that Podio or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets. For more information on how you will be notified in this instance, see Section 5 below.
  Occasionally we send offers to select groups of Podio customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not share your personal information with the other businesses. Except in the limited instances as stated above, we will never voluntarily share personally identifiable information with any third party without the user’s express consent or unless compelled by applicable state and federal laws. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.
  Podio does not control the practices of our affiliates. If you have questions about how affiliates use the information gathered when you link to them, please read their privacy policies. Links to other sites: This website may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Podio. Please be aware that we, Podio, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
  We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.
