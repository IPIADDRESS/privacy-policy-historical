<li>Information Sharing and Disclosure</li>
<h4>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h4>
<p>
We share aggregated demographic information about Our user base with Our marketing partners.
This information does not identify individual users. This information contains statistics related to traffic and
the geographic location of Our customers. We also may share aggregated user information with third parties who help
Us to analyze Our user base to improve the Service.
</p>
<p>
Other than as described herein, We do not link aggregate user data with personal information.
</p>
<h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
<p>
Podomatic employs third-party service providers to perform functions on Our behalf. Examples include
credit card processing, email service providers, analyzing data, providing customer service. These service providers
have access to personal information needed to perform such functions on Our behalf and authorized to use your personal
information only as necessary to provide these services to Us.
</p>
<p>
In the event of a business transfer or sale by Podomatic, customer information generally is one of the
transferred business assets but remains subject to the commitments made in any Podomatic pre-existing
Privacy Policy (unless, of course, you indicate otherwise).
</p>
<p>
We may release account and other personal information when We believe release is appropriate to comply with the law;
enforce or apply Our Terms of Service; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Podomatic,
Our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
</p>
<h4>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h4>
<p>
We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law.
We may be required to disclose and may disclose Your personal information in response to a lawful request
by public authorities, including to meet national securities or law enforcement requirements.
</p>
<p>
Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties,
and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. Podomatic is liable
for appropriate onward transfers of personal data to third parties.
</p>
<li>Log Files</li>

As is true of most websites, We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
</p>
<p>
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer websites,
to track users' movements around websites and to gather demographic information about Our user base as a whole.
We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.
</p>
<li>Cookies</li>
<p>
We and Our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags,

these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.

website, but your ability to use some features or areas of Our website may be limited.
</p>
<li>Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting</li>
