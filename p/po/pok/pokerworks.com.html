	<li><b id="personal">What Personal information is collected and for what purpose</b>
		<p>As part of the Site account opening process and to allow us to provide services to you, we will ask you to provide us with a user name, email address and a password. In some cases we may also ask you to provide certain personal information such as your full name, date of birth, country of residence, and Twitter and Facebook user names. </p>
		<p>We, members of our corporate group, our affiliates and third parties providing services on our behalf will use your personal information described above for various purposes such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>to provide information and/or services to you;</li>
			<li>identification and verification purposes;</li>
			<li>statistical analysis and research;</li>
			<li>research and development;</li>
			<li>marketing, market research and customer profiling;</li>
			<li>data analysis; and</li>
			<li>to comply with licensing and regulatory requirements.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We may disclose your personal information:</p>
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
			<li>if required to do so by law or by regulatory authority;</li>
			<li>if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary:
				<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
					<li>to comply with any law or comply with legal process served on us;</li>
					<li>to protect and defend our rights or property;</li>
					<li>to any regulatory body or licensing body or authority;</li>
					<li>to third parties who provide services to us or on our behalf; </li>
					<li>to any third party that purchases us or our business or any part of us or our business;</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>with your consent;</li>
			<li>for the purposes of disaster recovery; or</li>
			<li>as set out in Section 6 below.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Your personal information may be processed by us, other members of our corporate group, our affiliates, our agents and third parties providing services to us, in any jurisdiction and we will use all reasonable commercial efforts to comply with the terms of any data protection laws applicable to our activities.</p>
		<p>We will only use your name in publicity materials with your consent.</p>
		<p>It is very important that you complete the account details with valid information, since it will be used for the aforementioned purposes. You are required to advise us of any relevant changes to your personal information, if and where applicable.</p> 
	</li>
	<li><b id="non-personally">Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>
		<p>We may use “cookies” on or in connection with our Site to maintain information about you. A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. We use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. When you visit our Site, our computer may ask your computer for permission to employ the use of a session or persistent cookie. Our Site will then send a cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits our Site to access the cookies it has already sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many web browsers can be adjusted to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, our Site or certain areas or features of our Site.</p>
		<p>Our servers automatically collect data about your Internet Protocol address when you visit us. When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another website or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Site; the website you visit after this Site; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Site or a referral website; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. Your IP address can also be used for moderation purposes, in order to limit the creation of multiple accounts and SPAM prevention.</p>
		<p>When you use the Site, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make the Site better for our users.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Third Party Advertising Cookies</b>
		<p>Most of the advertisements you see on the website are generated by third parties.</p>
		<p>Some of these third parties generate their own cookies (or web beacons) to track how many people have seen a particular advertisement (or use the services of third parties to do this), and to track how many people have seen it more than once. These cookies cannot be used to identify an individual and the only information that will be obtained from these cookies is that the user has visited the PokerWorks.com website; they can only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Some of the information gleaned from third party cookies will be aggregated with other anonymous information for statistical purposes. The third party companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don't have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users of the website).</p>
		<p>If you would like to disable "third party" cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to the third party's website and getting them to generate a one-time "no thanks" cookie that will stop any further cookies being written to your machine. Here are links to two websites where you may opt out of receiving these cookies:  (i) Invite Media website (<a href="http://assets.invitemedia.com/opt-out.html" target="_blank">http://assets.invitemedia.com/opt-out.html</a>), and (ii) the Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>).</p>
		<p>You can also visit the trade body representing these advertising companies for more information on how to opt out of these cookies: <a href="http://youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">http://youronlinechoices.com/</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Special Promotions Privacy Terms</b>
		<p>PokerNews may, from time to time, initiate certain bonus programs and other promotional activities (collectively, the "<b>Promotions</b>"), in connection with which certain additional personal information may be collected from our users. Specifically, the personal information that may be collected in connection with our Promotions includes a user's name, surname, room nickname (i.e. the nickname the user gives him/herself in connection with the specific Promotion), email address, and country of residence. In addition, in certain Promotions as well as in certain cases in which further verification procedures so require, a user may also be asked to provide a telephone number and a facial photograph together with the user's ID.  </p>
		<p>PokerNews may disclose the personal information described above to such third parties with whom PokerNews partners in connection with the Promotions.  </p>
	</li>
	<li><b id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</b>
		<p>PokerNews undertakes appropriate efforts to protect the confidentiality of the identity, preferences and other information it collects about users of the Site and other than as specified in this Privacy Policy, it will not knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside PokerNews. </p>
		<p>You should also do your part in protecting your information. Your login credentials are confidential and you are obliged to keep your login credentials secret and confidential at all times and to take all efforts to protect their secrecy and confidentiality.</p>
		<p>Please be advised, however, that due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, the security of user information may be compromised at any time. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. </p>
	</li>
	<li><b id="limits-confidentiality">Limits of Confidentiality</b>
		<p>Due to the legal, regulatory and security environment in which we operate, PokerNews may be required, under certain circumstances, to disclose personally identifiable information of our users and we may not be permitted to inform you that we have done so. PokerNews will use reasonable endeavours to limit such disclosure where PokerNews believes in good faith that it is required to do so in response to a subpoena, warrant or other legal process, or where reasonably necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities to preserve and/or enforce PokerNews' rights. Further, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose your user identification information to third party agents of PokerNews or official government bodies as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity or activity that may expose us to legal liability.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b id="receives">Who receives your information?</b>
		<p>In addition to legally required disclosures as explained in this Privacy Policy, we may disclose your personal information to our employees, employees of other companies in our corporate group, our agents and to third party service providers who use your personal information to provide services to us in respect of your being a user of PokerNews. All recipients of your personal information shall be bound by applicable data protection laws to keep your personal information private.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b id="rights">Your rights in relation to your information</b>
		<p>We aim to keep our information about you as accurate as possible. You can write to us at any time to review, change, obtain a copy of your information or have your details altered or corrected in accordance with your rights under applicable laws, and in such event we may require evidence of your identity. In order to contact us regarding your information please e-mail info@PokerWorks.com. We may in certain circumstances levy a small charge to cover the cost of administration regarding any request made by you in this regard.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b id="links">Links</b>
		<p>The Site may contain links to third parties' websites. While we attempt to provide links to sites that value your privacy, we cannot be responsible for the content or privacy policies of such sites. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of such third parties' websites prior to any use of such websites.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b id="opt-out">Opt-Out Options </b>
		<p>We and other members of our corporate group may occasionally send you emails with information on events and news or information regarding new services or in connection with customer support matters. If you no longer wish to receive our email newsletters, you can opt-out, at any time, by sending us an email to info@PokerWorks.com requesting removal of your email address from any such mailing lists. If applicable, you may also opt-out from receiving marketing communications from us by following instructions on our email communications explaining how to unsubscribe from our email mailing lists. We will take appropriate steps to fulfill your request within reasonable time; however, it may take a few days or longer to process your request during which you may still receive marketing communications from us. We reserve the right to send you non-marketing notice about your account, even if you opt-out of all email notifications.</p>
		<p>If you decide to terminate your account with us, you may do so by sending us an email to info@PokerWorks.com specifying your request and providing us with your PokerNews Username and email address with which you registered. If you terminate your account, your profile will be removed from the Site, however, deletion may not be immediate and we may continue keeping your personal information in our records for audits and other administrative purposes.</p>
