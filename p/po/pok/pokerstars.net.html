</ol><p>We and other members of our corporate Group may occasionally send you  events and news information or information regarding new services and  to provide you with customer support services.

Confidentiality</h2><p>PokerStars undertakes substantial efforts to protect the  confidentiality of the identity, preferences and other information it  has collected about individual Users &nbsp;and will not knowingly allow  access to this information to anyone outside PokerStars, other than to  the User or as described in this Privacy Policy.

<p>Please note that, if you use our Home Games service,  your PokerStars player account User ID will also be your Club Manager or  Member identifier, and will be displayed to the Club Manager and  Members in the Home Games lobby, Club lobby and (if the Club Manager  opts-in for inclusion in directories) public directories of Clubs. Thus,  people who know you through Home Games and/or your Club will also know  the identity of your PokerStars player account User ID. If you do not  agree to this, you must not use Home Games.</p><h2>4. Limits of Confidentiality</h2><p>Legally Required Disclosures: Due to the legal, regulatory and security  environment in which we operate, PokerStars may be required, under  certain circumstances, to disclose personally identifiable information  about our Users and we may not be permitted to inform you that we have  done so. PokerStars will use reasonable endeavours to limit such  disclosure to the following: where PokerStars believes in good faith  that it is required to do so in response to a subpoena, warrant or other  legal process; or where reasonably necessary to identify, contact or  bring legal action against persons or entities to preserve and/or  enforce PokerStars' rights. Further, we can, and you authorize us to,  disclose your User identification, name, street address, city, state,  post code, country, phone number, e-mail, and company information to  third party agents of PokerStars or official government bodies as we, in  our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection  with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement,  piracy or other unlawful activity or activity that may expose us to  legal liability.</p><h2>5. Who receives your information?</h2><p>In addition to legally required disclosures as explained in this  Privacy Policy, we may disclose your personal information to our  employees, employees of other companies in our corporate Group, our  agents and to third party service providers who use your personal  information to provide services to us in respect of your being a User  with PokerStars.</p>

We will treat this combined information in  accordance with, and will use it for, the purposes set out in this  Policy.</p>
<p>All recipients of your personal information shall be  bound by applicable data protection laws to keep your personal  information private at no less a level than that by which we are bound.</p><h2>6. Your rights in relation to your information</h2><p>We aim to keep our information about you as accurate as possible. You  can write to us at any time to review, change, obtain a copy of your  information or have your details altered or corrected in accordance with  your rights under the Isle of Man’s Data Protection Act 2002 and in  this event we may require evidence of your identity.

Cookies</h2><p>Cookies are text-only strings of information that are downloaded to  your personal desktop, laptop computer or mobile device (each a “<strong>Device</strong>”)  when you visit a website. They are then sent back to the originating  website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises  those cookies.</p>
<p>Cookies are very useful and are used for many different  purposes.
