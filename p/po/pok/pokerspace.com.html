<p>Pokerspace is a social  network that allows its members to share information within the community. We  believe that all members should have full control over their information and  the way it’s shared. Therefore we have implemented a reasonable set of standard  default settings which a User can easily adjust his/her preferences.&nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc180175148" id="_Toc180175148">The Information We Collect</a></h3>
<p>When you visit Pokerspace you provide us with  two types of information: personal information that you knowingly choose to  disclose and information collected as you interact with the Pokerspace platform.<br>
  When you  register with Pokerspace, you provide us with certain personal information,  such as your name, your email address, your telephone number, your address,  your gender, schools attended and any other personal or preference information  that you choose to provide to us. <br>
  When you use  Pokerspace, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send  messages, perform searches and queries, form groups, set up events, and  transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so  that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most  cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior  messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update  information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a  reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that  information. <br>
  You post User  Content (as defined in the Pokerspace Terms  and Conditions) on the site  at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit  access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or  impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may  choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not  guarantee that User Content you post on the site will not be viewed by  unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy  settings or security measures contained on the site. You understand and  acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain  viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored  your User Content. <br>
  Pokerspace  may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers,  blogs, instant messaging services, and other Users of the Pokerspace service  through the operation of the service in order to provide you with more useful  information and a more personalized experience. By using Pokerspace, you are  consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in Canada. <br>
  Any improper  collection or misuse of information provided on Pokerspace is a violation of  the Pokerspace Terms and Conditions and should be reported to privacy@Pokerspace.com</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc180175149" id="_Toc180175149">Minimum Age Requirement</a> </h3>
<p>No one under the age of 18 is permitted to  use Pokerspace.com or any of its affiliates and subsidiaries.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc180175150" id="_Toc180175150">Use of Information Obtained by Pokerspace</a> </h3>
<p>When you register with Pokerspace, you create  your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as  your name, email and photo, are displayed to people allowed privacy settings to  enable you to connect with people on Pokerspace. We may occasionally use your  name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered  by Pokerspace that we think you may find valuable. <br>
  Profile  information is used by Pokerspace primarily to be presented back to and edited  by you when you access the service and to be presented to others permitted to  view that information by your privacy settings. In some cases where your  privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting to your chatboard), other Pokerspace Users  may be able to supplement your profile. <br>
  Your name,  and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Pokerspace  network. This is primarily so your friends can find you and send a buddy  request. People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to  access your profile information unless they have a relationship to you (friend,  friend of friend, member of your networks, etc.) that allows such access based  on your privacy settings. <br>
  Pokerspace  may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the  general operation of the service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new  message or event invitation, or someone posts on your chatboard, you may  receive an email alerting you of such requests. <br>
  Pokerspace  may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to  third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people in a  network like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and promotions.  You can know more about the world around you they're more likely to be  interesting to you. For example, if you put a favorite poker website, we might  post offers about this website so you’re update and connected to things you  enjoy.<br>
  We may use  information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not  limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging  services, Pokerspace Platform developers and other Users of Pokerspace, to  supplement your profile. Where such information is used, we generally allow you  to specify in your privacy settings that you do not want this to be done or to  take other actions that limit the connection of this information to your  profile. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc180175151" id="_Toc180175151">Inviting Friends</a> </h3>
<p>When inviting friends to join the site you  may enter their email addresses directly, or use one of our import options to  import friend's lists. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email  inviting him or her to visit the site. We do not store any of your friend's  email addresses if they decline your invitation and do not join the site. We do  not store any other information you provide to import friend's lists or invite  friends. Such information is provided only and directly to the program or  website you have selected to import your contacts from. <br>
  As with any site that uses invitations and buddy lists, you should use care  when disclosing your personal information to strangers. Be advised that if you  send messages containing personal information, that information may be  collected and used by others.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc180175152" id="_Toc180175152">Email Notifications</a></h3>
<p>The following kinds of optional notifications  may be sent to you by email, depending on your chosen preferences. The  notifications can be configured by going to the “Preferences” page on Pokerspace.  This functionality may not be available during the first release, but is a part  of the Pokerspace product roadmap.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Buddy  Notification: When someone adds you as a buddy</li>
  <li>Message  Notification: When someone writes you a new message</li>
  <li>Poker Crew  Notification: When someone invites to their crew</li>
  <li>Event: When  someone invites you to an event</li>
  <li>Group: When  someone invites you to a group</li>

  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc180175153" id="_Toc180175153">Market Research Surveys</a> </h3>
<p>If you choose to earn extra PS Points by  completing surveys offered by our research partners, the information you submit  in completing this survey will be transmitted to them. However none of this  information will be personally identifiable – it shall be used for research  purposes only, and in aggregate form. You will know what the survey is about  before you take it, and will have the option of canceling it at anytime before or  during the survey. We do not work or associate with research companies that are  in the business of trading personal information.
</p>
<br clear="all">
<h3><a name="_Toc180175154" id="_Toc180175154">Affiliate Offers</a></h3>
<p>You can sign up for a promotional offer by an  advertiser to earn PS Points. This will require you to click on a link, and  leave the Pokerspace site. Affiliate Offers typically require your name, age,  location, and email address, though they may require more information. THIS  INFORMATION IS TRANSMITTED TO THE ADVERTISER. ANY INFORMATION YOU ENTER ON ANY  SITE AFTER LEAVING POKERSPACE.COM BECOMES THE PROPERTY OF THE ADVERTISER, AND  ITS USE IS GOVERNED BY THE ADVERTISERS’ PRIVACY POLICY. Before entering any  information into an affiliate offer, you are advised to be aware of the  advertisers’ privacy policies and their use of your information.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc180175155" id="_Toc180175155">Use of Cookies</a> </h3>
<p>When you enter Pokerspace, we collect your  browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all Pokerspace  visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using  "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the User's computer  tied to information about the User. We use session ID cookies to confirm that Users  are logged in. These cookies terminate once the User closes the browser. By  default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your  password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to Pokerspace.  You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you  want to disable this convenience feature. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc180175156" id="_Toc180175156">Third-Party Advertisers</a> </h3>
<p>The ads appearing on Pokerspace are delivered  to Users by our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set  cookies. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time  they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile  information about your location, or others who are using your computer that saw  their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information  allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will  be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control of the cookies  that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. <br>
  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Pokerspace, and does not  cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

We  encourage our Users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy  statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable  information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Pokerspace.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc180175158" id="_Toc180175158">Merger or Acquisition</a> </h3>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Pokerspace.com,  such as acquisition by or merger with another company. If an acquiring company  should plan to materially change this privacy policy, we will notify you  beforehand.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc180175159" id="_Toc180175159">Security</a> </h3>
