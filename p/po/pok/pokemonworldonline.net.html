<img src="./graphics/pp_head.png" alt="Privacy Policy">

<p>Your personal information and privacy are important to CodeCore Entertainment and Pokémon World Online. 
Establishing and maintaining a trusting relationship between our service and our players is crucial to 
the success of our games, and this Privacy Policy has been created and enforced with the intent of 
allowing our users to feel comfortable and safe while participating in our services.
<br><br>
If you feel that CodeCore Entertainment and Pokémon World Online are not abiding by its posted policies, 
you should contact an Administrator via the Pokémon World Online forums.
<br><br>
Personal Information is information that someone would be able to use to contact or identify you. This 
includes information such as your full name, telephone number, or email address. Personal Information 
does not include compiled data that by itself cannot be used to identify an individual person (such as 
the percentage of users that hail from a specific country).
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy is a part of our End-User License Agreement and Terms of Service Agreements, and by 
participating in any portion of the service you agree to be bound by its terms and conditions. This 
Privacy Policy only addresses activities conducted within our services. Any other website or service 
(including those to which we may link) may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus 
are not addressed, controlled, or influenced by this policy.
<br><br>
<b>I Collection of Personal Information</b>
<br><br>
You provide certain Personal Information, such as your email address, upon registering with the CodeCore 
Entertainment and Pokémon World Online service, sending support emails to CodeCore Entertainment or 
Pokémon World Online, and via completion of forms or other questionnaires sent to us.
<br><br>
<b>II Storage of Personal Information</b>
<br><br>
CodeCore Entertainment, who is responsible for the operation of all CodeCore Entertainment and Pokémon 
World Online web sites and services, is the company that collects Personal Information within the scope 
of our services.
<br><br>
<b>III How Personal Information May be Used</b>
<br><br>
Any Personal Information submitted to CodeCore Entertainment may be used by CodeCore Entertainment and 
Pokémon World Online for a variety of reasons, within reasonable limitation.
<br><br>
This information may be used to identify rightful possession of an account in the event of a lost or 
stolen password. This information may be used to identify multiple accounts as falling under the 
possession of one individual. This information may be used to prevent those in possession of terminated 
accounts future access to the service. This information may be used to provide optional email updates 
from either our website or forums, at the sole discretion of you, the user.
<br><br>
In the highly unlikely event that legal authorities request CodeCore Entertainment provide such Personal 
Information for use in any legal context, CodeCore Entertainment and Pokémon World Online will be 
required to oblige the requests of such authorities.
<br><br>
This information may not and will not be shared with any third party source, with the exception of law 
enforcement officials as previously noted. This information may not and will not be sold to any third 
party source. This information may not and will not be gathered unwillingly or without the knowledge of 
its provider under any circumstance; all information collected by CodeCore Entertainment and Pokémon 
World Online must be consented by its source.
<br><br>
<b>IV Child Protection</b>
<br><br>
In order to protect the privacy interests of minors, we do not allow children under the age of 18 to 
participate in any service provided by CodeCore Entertainment or Pokémon World Online, including forums 
and game, without the consent of a parent or guardian.
<br><br>
<b>V Protection of Personal Information</b>
<br><br>
CodeCore Entertainment and Pokémon World Online take necessary precautions to protect our users' 
information; any information willingly provided to CodeCore Entertainment and Pokémon World Online is 
protected both online and offline.
<br><br>
We have established and maintain reasonable security procedures to protect the confidentiality and 
integrity of your Personal Information. Encryption and other security measures (such as but not limited 
to off-site backup and password protection), as well as any combination of such practices, are used by 
CodeCore Entertainment and Pokémon World Online to help provide our users with adequate security in 
regards to private data. 
<br><br>
The number of individuals who have access to any Personal Information collected by CodeCore Entertainment 
and Pokémon World Online is limited to a very small number of people, and our staff is routinely updated 
and debriefed as our security practices develop and evolve.
<br><br>
By participating in any portion of any service provided by CodeCore Entertainment and Pokémon World Online, 
including forums and game, you acknowledge that "perfect security" does not exist on the internet and that 
CodeCore Entertainment and Pokémon World Online will execute to the fullest extent of their power the best 
security and protection possible to ensure the integrity of your Personal Information.
<br><br>
If you have any questions about the security provided by the service, you can contact an Administrator on 
the Pokémon World Online forums.</p>
