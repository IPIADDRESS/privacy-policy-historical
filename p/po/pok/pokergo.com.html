			<i>Cookies and Web Beacons</i>
			<p>We may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser). We also may use web beacons (an electronic file placed on a website that monitors usage). We use cookies and web beacons to improve the experience of the Site and Services, such as pre-populating your username for easier login. We do not use cookies or web beacons to collect Personal Data. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Site or Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Some of our Third-Party Providers and Advertisers (as such terms are defined below), may use their own cookies and web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.</p>
			<br>
			<i>Google Analytics Advertising Features</i>
			<p>We have implemented certain Google Analytics Advertising Features, including Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, and Remarketing with Google Analytics. We use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie), along with other first-party identifiers, third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) and other third-party identifiers, not only to improve the Site experience for our users, but also to aggregate the characteristics and browsing habits of our users, on an anonymous basis, to provide products and services that are more tailored to our users. We also use these types of cookies and identifiers to improve and target our marketing and remarketing efforts and serve ads based on our users' prior visits to our Site, also on an anonymous basis. We do not use cookies of any kind to disclose or transmit Personal Data. There are a number of ways you can opt out of the Google Analytics Advertiser Features we use, including via changing your Ads Settings on Google or changing the ads settings on the web browser you are using. You can also use the opt-out tool provided by the Network Advertising Initiative, <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org">here</a>. Google provides a free browser add-on, called the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, which provides website users the ability to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics. The browser add-on may be downloaded <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.</p>
			<br>
			<i>Advertising</i>
			<p>We may work with third-party advertisers, search providers and ad networks ("Advertisers").  Advertisers may collect and use information about your use of the Site or Services as well as other websites and services to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as web beacons to collect such information. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an ad network may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown via the Site, the Services, or on third-party websites.

			<h1>HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h1>
			<i>Generally</i>
			<p>We will not disclose your Personal Data to third parties, including for their direct marketing purposes, without your consent, except as explained in this Privacy Policy or permitted by law. We may disclose to third parties certain Usage Data regarding the Site and Services. However, in such cases, your Usage Data is aggregated with the Usage Data of others and does not identify you individually.</p>
			<br>
			<i>Profile Information You Make Available to Others</i>
			<p>By using the Site or the Services you may make certain types of your Personal Data available to others. For example, if your user name contains your real name, and you post a comment in a public area of the Site, other users may see your name and other information from your public profile that you choose to make available to others, such as your home town. The information you choose to make publicly available may be accessed by users who use the Site or Services and may be accessed by commercial search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing to the extent that such engines are permitted to access the Site.</p>
			<br>
			<i>Third-Party Providers</i>
			<p>From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses whom we believe trustworthy and who we believe have privacy practices that are consistent with ours ("Third-Party Providers"). For example, we may contract with Third-Party Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, payment processing, and marketing and promotions.  We only provide our Third-Party Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider is expected to use reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Third-Party Providers are prohibited from using Personal Data other than as specified by Poker Central.</p>
			<p>As an example of services being provided by Third-Party Providers, payment processing services for goods and/or services purchased on the Site may be provided by Endeavor Streaming Limited, a subsidiary of Endeavor Streaming, Inc., on behalf of Endeavor Streaming, Inc., depending on the type of payment method used for the purchase of the goods and/or services.</p>
			<br>
			<i>Joint Services</i>
			<p>We may provide services jointly with other companies. In some cases, to facilitate such services, it may be necessary to share your Personal Data with such other companies. Before we do so, we will identify the partner, present the joint service provider's privacy policy to you before you use that service, and obtain your permission to share your Personal Data.</p>
			<br>
			<i>Third-Party Services and Applications</i>
			<p>Through the Site and the Services, you may have the ability to elect to access third-party services and applications, such as Facebook and other social networks. When you do so, you may be able to import information from those other services and applications and share content with those services. Some of those third-party services may also provide us with information from your accounts which may enable us to enhance and personalize your use of the Site and Services (e.g., so that you can follow your Facebook friends' activity on the Site or Services). If you elect to use such third-party services or applications through the Services, the information you share with such third-party services and applications will be subject to their privacy policies and your privacy settings for such services. You also may be able to control or block such sharing by changing your privacy settings in such services or applications.</p>
			<br>
			<i>Other Transfers</i>
			<p>We may share Personal Data and Usage Data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Poker Central. If Poker Central is merged, acquired or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Data and Usage Data in connection with such transaction. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our reasonable judgment, the new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<br>
			<i>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</i>
			<p>Poker Central cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with applicable law.  We may disclose Personal Data, Usage Data and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property or rights of Poker Central or of any third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with applicable law.</p>
			<br>
			<i>Sharing Information with Others</i>
			<p>Please be aware that whenever you share information on public forums on the Site, that information may be accessed by others. In addition, please remember that when you share information in any other communications with third parties, that information may be passed along or made public by others. This means that anyone with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications.</p>

			<h1>HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR DATA</h1>
			<p>We retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it including for the duration of our relationship with you.  We also retain your personal data for a period of time after our relationship with you has ended where there is an ongoing business need to retain it.  This includes retention to comply with our legal, regulatory, tax, and/or accounting obligations.  We do so in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable law.</p>

			<h1>SECURITY</h1>
			<p>Poker Central recognizes the importance of safeguarding the confidentiality of your Personal Data. Accordingly, we employ reasonable measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure and use. However, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Site or Services, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Site or Services, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
			<h1>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h1>
			<p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Data from a child under the age of 18, we will delete such information from our records.</p>
			<h1>PROCESSING IN THE UNITED STATES</h1>
