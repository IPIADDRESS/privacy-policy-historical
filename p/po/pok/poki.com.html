		<span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy was last updated on the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of July, 2017.</span>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">Poki is committed to protecting the privacy of all visitors who use our site and applications, including older users above the age of 13 (“General Users”) and younger users under the age of 13 (“Children Users”), together the “Users”. </span>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy” or “Policy”) is designed to provide transparency into Poki’s privacy practices and principles for information that we collect from General Users through our Poki.com web platform, mobile applications, our Poki Publishing services, and other general-audience sites and applications (“Poki General Site”), as well as information that we may collect from Children Users through our separate Kids.Poki.com web platform and other children-focused sites and applications (“Poki Kids Site”). The Poki General Site and Poki Kids Site (together, the “Poki Site”) are owned and operated by Poki B.V. (referred to in this Policy as “Poki”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). Poki B.V. (“Poki”) is an entity incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. </span>

		<h3>1. General information</h3>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">All features on the Poki Site are available without the need for registration by Users. No personal data (such as email addresses and phone numbers) are collected. Poki will collect certain electronic data (such as the User’s IP address, cookies or device ID).</span>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a User clicks to leave the Poki Site, Poki may try to inform the User that they are leaving the Poki Site and that this Privacy Policy will no longer apply. When a User provides personal data on any third party website or application, the processing of such personal data will be governed by any privacy statement applicable to that site/application. In any event, Poki shall not act as the Data Controller or the Processor of such personal data</span>.
		<h3>2. Data collection and its purposes</h3>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). The Poki Site may gather anonymous “traffic data” that does not personally identify you, but that data may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.</span>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">When your computer or mobile device contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit the Poki Site), our web servers automatically collect usage information. Such usage information includes information about how our visitors use and navigate the Poki Site. It can include the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Site, and IP addresses. </span>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to help administer the Poki Site, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis. &nbsp;More information about sharing information will follow in part 7.</span>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Advertisers on the Poki General Site might use information gathered by the use of cookies for targeted advertising purposes. Further information regarding the use of cookies can be found below.</span>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions concerning data collection on the Poki Site or a request to delete data collected (as applicable), please contact us at </span><a href="mailto:privacy@poki.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy@poki.com</span></a>.
		<h3>3. Third party games</h3>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of personal data by data controllers other than Poki, such as – as the case may be – providers of third party games available on the Poki Site. The relevant provider of such a third party game is responsible for ensuring that any processing of personal data by them in the context of a game complies with applicable data protection law.</span>

		<h3>6. Sharing information</h3>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">Poki may share your persistent identifiers with third parties such as business partners under the following circumstances:</span>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">Security: We may release information about our Users, including IP address, when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation or to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing the Poki Site and applicable laws. We may also disclose such user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Poki, or any of our respective business partners, customers or others.</span>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggregate Information: We may disclose non-identifying, aggregated user statistics to third parties for a variety of purposes, including describing our services to prospective partners and other third parties. Examples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited this Poki Site during a specific time period or played a specific game on this Website</span>.
		<h3>7. Children Users</h3>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children’s use of online activities regularly. &nbsp;This is why we created a separate age-appropriate experience for Children Users through the Poki Kids Site. </span>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Poki Kids Site supports and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). No personal information is purposefully or knowingly collected from Children Users on the Poki Kids Site. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no registration required for the Poki Kids Site and any advertising shown on the site is age-appropriate. The Poki Kids Site will not show behaviorally targeted ads or allow third parties to track the activity of Children Users for that purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Poki Kids Site may collect and use IP addresses and other persistent identifiers from Children Users, but only for purposes of supporting our internal operations, such as to help us:</span>
		<ul>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain or analyze the functioning of the Poki Kids Site</span></li>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform network communications</span></li>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authenticate users of, or personalize the content on, the Poki Kids Site</span></li>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serve contextual advertising on the Poki Kids Site and cap the frequency of advertising</span></li>
		</ul>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have separated our platform into a few sections. Poki Kids was created for our youngest audience&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and is fully COPPA compliant. If you are a Child User, you should only use the Poki Kids Site and only&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the permission of a parent or legal guardian. On Poki.com, you’ll find games that are intended at&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">users that are over 13. Poki.com is not targeted towards children under the age of 13 and it will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn more about COPPA, please reference this simple one-page informational guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html</span></a>.
		<h3>8. Revisions to this Privacy Policy</h3>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">We may change this privacy policy from time to time to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. If we update this policy, changes will be reflected on this page and we will update the “last updated” date above. We will obtain prior parental consent for any changes we make if those changes affect Children Users in a way that requires parental consent under COPPA</span>.
