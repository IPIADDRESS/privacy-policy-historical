		<p> As part of the PokerStars Account Opening process, we will ask  you to provide us with certain personal information, including a name,  postal address, e-mail address and password as well as to certify that  you are at least 18 years old or older in jurisdictions in which the  minimum age for use of the PokerStars services is greater than 18.

If you no longer wish to  receive our newsletters, you may opt-out of receiving them by following  the instructions included in each newsletter. The name you register  with must be yours. In addition, it is very important that you complete  the account details with valid information, since they will be used in  the course of validating financial transactions and the other  aforementioned purposes. </p>
		<p> Players are able to change account details by selecting an Account option in the downloaded software. </p>
		<p> <a name="deposit" id="deposit"></a><br>
		<span class="strong">2. Deposit and withdrawal processing</span> </p>
		<p> To play for real money, Players will need to make a deposit. In  the course of making a deposit, Players will need to provide deposit  method information (example: credit card number). This information in  conjunction with your other personal information might be used to clear  financial transactions executed by you with PokerStars. </p>
		<p> <a name="confidentiality" id="confidentiality"></a><br>
		<span class="strong">3. Confidentiality</span> </p>
		<p> PokerStars undertakes substantial efforts to protect the  confidentiality of the identity, preferences and other information it  has collected about individual Players and will not knowingly allow  access to this information to anyone outside PokerStars, other than to  the Player or as described in this Privacy Policy. PokerStars has made  a substantial investment in its server, database, backup, firewall and  encryption technologies to protect the information collected by  PokerStars. These technologies are deployed as part of state of the art  security architecture, see <a href="http://www.pokerstars.com/poker/room/features/security/">www.pokerstars.com/poker/room/features/security/</a>. </p>
		<p> All PokerStars employees are required to comply with the terms  of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy provides that employees are  obligated to keep Player information strictly confidential. This  obligation continues once an employee has left our Company. </p>
		<p> You should also do your part in protecting your information.  Your PokerStars Player password is confidential and we recommend that  you not divulge it to anyone or enable others to discover it. </p>
		<p> <a name="limits" id="limits"></a><br>
		<span class="strong">4. Limits of Confidentiality</span> </p>
		<p> Legally Required Disclosures: Due to the existing legal,  regulatory and security environment, PokerStars may be required, under  certain circumstances, to disclose personally identifiable information  about our Players. PokerStars will use its best reasonable efforts to  limit such disclosure to the following: where PokerStars believes in  good faith that it is required to do so in response to a subpoena,  warrant or other legal process; or where reasonably necessary to  identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities to  preserve and/or enforce PokerStars' rights. Further, we can, and you  authorize us to, disclose your Player identification, name, street  address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, e-mail, and  company to third party agents of PokerStars as we, in our sole  discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an  investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or  other unlawful activity or activity that may expose us to legal  liability. </p>

		<span class="strong">5. Who receives your information?</span> </p>
		<p> In addition to legally required disclosures as explained in Section 4  above, we may disclose your personal information to our employees,  employees of other companies related to or affiliated with Rational  Enterprises Ltda. and to third party service providers who use your  personal information to provide services to us in respect of your being  a Player with PokerStars. All recipients of your personal information  shall be bound by applicable data protection laws to keep your personal  information private at no less a level than that by which we are bound. </p>
