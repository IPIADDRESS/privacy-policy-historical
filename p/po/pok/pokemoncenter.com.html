<p>Welcome to Pokémon!</p>

<p>Pokémon respects the privacy rights of our online visitors and

Pokémon, whether for tablets, smart TVs, video game consoles, social

available by us, or produced and maintained by Pokémon (collectively 
“Pokémon” or “we”, “us”, or “our”).  We have established this privacy 
policy (“Privacy Policy”) to let you know the kinds of personal 
information we may gather during your visit to these Sites, why we 
gather your information, what we use your personal information for, when
 we might disclose your personal information, and how you can manage 
your personal information. </p>

<p>We also recognize the need to provide additional protections for 
children who visit our Sites. To learn about our supplemental privacy

<p>1. <a id="11" name="11"></a>What information does this Privacy Policy cover?</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected on
 the Sites where this Privacy Policy is posted, and, unless Pokémon 
specifies otherwise in writing, does not apply to any other information 
collected by Pokémon through any other means.</p>

<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information 
submitted and collected online, and does not apply to information that 
may be collected by Pokémon offline. This Privacy Policy applies only to
 Sites maintained by Pokémon, and not to our international affiliates, 
or any website maintained by other companies or organizations to which 
we link. Pokémon is therefore not responsible for the content or 
activities provided on those website websites.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to use and sharing of personal 
information collected as of the date this Privacy Policy is posted. 
Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable 
laws.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/privacy-policy/#top">back to top</a></p>

<p>2. <a id="12" name="12"></a><strong>What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?</strong></p>

<p>We don't require personal information to access our Sites. However, 
if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you will not be able
 to enjoy certain features of our Sites. Personal information is 
information that identifies you and may be used to contact you.</p>

<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>

<p>We receive information from our guests and, with our guests' consent,
 from third parties such as Pokémon Organized Play ("POP") tournament 
organizers. We collect personal information directly from our guests 
when they:</p>

<ol class="list">
<li><p>create an account for Pokémon's Sites</p></li>
<li><p>link an account from one of Pokémon’s Sites with an account from another site operated by Pokémon or an affiliate of Pokémon</p></li>
<li><p>participate in games, reward programs, contests, sweepstakes, events, or promotions</p></li>
<li><p>send questions, correspond with us via e-mail concerning their participation in POP or request customer support</p></li>
<li><p>participate in polls, surveys, or questionnaires</p></li>
<li><p>use our Email-a-Friend feature</p></li>
<li><p>provide us with business information, such as when they apply for or have a special role in POP (such as Pokémon professors or league or tournament organizers) or seek employment</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Typically, this information includes:</p>

<ol class="list">
<li><p>personal first and last name</p></li>
<li><p>email address</p></li>
<li><p>telephone number</p></li>
<li><p>address and location based information (where necessary for the provision of services)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal 
information (known as demographic information) such as your age, gender,
 the country where you live, dates of birth, hobbies, and toy and game 
ownership preferences. This demographic information may be associated 
with your personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Business Information (Including Pokémon Professor, League or Tournament Organizer Applications)</strong></p>

<p>When you apply to be or serve as a POP organizer, you agree that we 
may use any personal information submitted to or collected by us may be 
used for any lawful business purpose. We may share this personal 
information with independent third parties who run POP events so that 
they can contact the POP organizers about participating in those events 
and other POP matters. These independent third parties may not have 
agreed to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy.  You should ask 
about such third parties’ privacy policies.</p>

<p>Any personal information submitted to us on-line by job applicants, 
and by persons specifying that they are submitting personal information 
in a business capacity, will be used solely for its intended purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Information Collected Through Technology</strong></p>

<p>We collect information through technology to make our Sites more 
interesting and useful to you. For example, when you come to one of our 
Sites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated 
with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP 
(Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. At times,
 we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency
 with which our guests visit various parts of our Sites. We may combine 
this information with personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><strong>Location Based Information</strong></p>

<p>We may collect and store your device’s source IP address which may 
disclose the location of your device at the time you access the Sites.  
Advertisements and certain content could be directed to you as a result 
of this data.  In addition, in some cases the Sites can deliver content 
based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature. If 
you enable that feature, your current location will be stored locally on
 your device which will be used by the Sites to serve you certain 
content tied to your location.  If you elect to have your location-based
 searches saved to your history, we will store such information on our 
servers (collectively, all location based information collected by 
Pokémon is “Location Information”).  You always may disable these 
features or withdraw your consent to providing your Location 
Information.  However, if you prefer not to disclose Location 
Information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our 
Sites.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Our Sites also use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a 
Site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Site. We and other
 companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For example, when you 
return to one of our Sites after logging in, cookies provide information
 to the Site so that the Site will remember who you are. You can choose 
to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you 
can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser
 (like Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a
 little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the 
correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't 
have access to many features that make your experience smoother, like 
the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function 
properly.</p>

<p><strong>Web Beacons and Log Files</strong></p>

<p>Our Sites use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, 
including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are 
embedded in images on the pages of various sites. We also use these 
technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Sites, such as 
the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Sites. 
These technical methods may involve the transmission of information 
either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect 
information on our behalf. Our Sites use log files to record which pages
 visitors to our site accessed, how long they stayed on the site, where 
they came from and other data. We also use these technical methods in 
HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests 
have opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those e-mails. The 
information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a 
form that is personally identifiable.</p>

<p>Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement or other link and 
have left our Sites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must 
read the privacy policy of the host of that site to see how your 
personal information will be handled on their site.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/privacy-policy/#top">back to top</a></p>

<p>3. <a id="13" name="13"></a><strong>How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?</strong></p>

<p>We don't share, sell, or rent your personal information to third 
parties without your prior consent. We don't require personal 
information to access our Sites. However, if you prefer not to disclose 
personal information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of 
our Sites.</p>

<p>Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the 
extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate 
business objectives.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon Online Tools and Events</strong></p>

<p>For example, if you register on our Sites, your information will be 
used to provide you the benefits associated with registration, including
 the ability to create a Trainer Image and to earn Trainer Tokens. In 
addition, if you participate in a game, contest, sweepstakes, or other 
similar event ("promotion"), the information provided in connection with
 the promotion will be used to determine your entry eligibility, to 
contact you with the results, and for prize fulfillment purposes.</p>

<p><strong>POP Participants</strong></p>

<p>If you chose to participate in the POP tournament ratings and rankings portion of our site, <a href="http://www.pokemon.com">www.pokemon.com</a>,
 then we will use your personal information about you to track your 
tournament results, Player Ranking, rating, player status (e.g., active,
 terminated, winner etc.). If you are 13 and older, we will post your 
full name or first name and last initial (as you direct us) and your 
state and country on the appropriate Site(s) with your Player Ranking. 
If you are under 13, then your parent or guardian can choose to post 
your username, full name, or first name and last initial in the Player 
Rankings.</p>

<p>Also if you chose to participate in the POP tournament ratings and rankings portion of our site, <a href="http://www.pokemon.com">www.pokemon.com</a>,
 we will share your personal information with independent third parties 
who run POP events (such as league leaders and tournament organizers) so
 that they can run POP events that you may participate in. In most 
cases, these are independent third parties and not Pokémon employees. 
They've agreed to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy, but Pokémon
 cannot guarantee that these independent third parties will safeguard 
your personal information. If you don't want your personal information 
shared with independent third parties who run offline POP events, then 
don't apply to participate in the POP tournament ratings and rankings 
portion of our site.</p>

<p><strong>Message Boards</strong></p>

<p>If you register for access to our message boards or chat rooms, we 
will use your personal information to enable you to view and post 
messages on the boards. However, you should understand that community 
forums and message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with 
members of the online community. That's why whenever you give out 
personal information online in public areas, that information can be 
collected and used by people you don't know.</p>

<p><strong>Operational Uses</strong></p>

<p>We may also use your personal information for other purposes such as 
"Operational Uses." For example, we may use your information to send you
 administrative communications either about your account with us or 
about features of our Sites, including any future changes to this 
Privacy Policy. If you have selected to receive online marketing 
communications from our site, your personal information may be used to 
send you marketing material about our products and services.</p>

<p><strong>Outside Vendors</strong></p>

<p>Pokémon may share your personal information with outside entities 
hired to assist with internal Site support operations (e.g., online 
product fulfillment, email services, or technical support). We also 
provide postal addresses to delivery service companies for delivery 
purposes. In the course of providing such services, these companies may 
have access to your personally identifying information. These entities 
have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of 
all the personal information they obtain from us.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer of Personal Information from Application to Pokémon</strong></p>

<p>To the extent that you have installed a Pokémon application on your 
device, except as disclosed below, the personal information collected by
 the application remains on the application and is not provided to 
Pokémon. Pokémon will have access to your personal information or your 
personal information will be transferred to Pokémon’s servers in any of 
the following circumstances:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Pokémon may also access certain data from the application, including
 without limitation the user supplied information and device 
information, for statistical analysis. All such data has been anonymized
 prior to Pokémon’s collection and storage.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use of Your Location Information</strong></p>

<p>We may only use and share your Location Information in conjunction 
with our right described in “Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures
 to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Sites and Others” below 
and to:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Customize the default country and default language to show you the products and services in your chosen language and country.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide you with the products and services you request.</p></li>
<li><p>Personalize content and experiences on our Sites, including providing you recommendations based on your preferences.</p></li>
<li><p>Personalize your newsletters, offers and promotions for our 
products and services, third party products and services, or special 
events.</p></li>
<li><p>Personalize the advertising you receive, including advertising 
based on your activity on our Sites or activity on third party sites and
 applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize or improve our products, services and operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Detect, investigate, and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform statistical, demographic, and marketing analyses of users of the Sites and their purchasing patterns.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong></p>

<p>Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and 
make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with 
information about other individuals (aggregating your information with 
information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics 
(such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to
 you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this 
information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our 
right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we 
may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting 
non-personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><strong>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</strong></p>

<p>In the event of a merger, sale of assets, acquisition, dissolution, 
reorganization, bankruptcy, change of control or other similar event, 
your personally identifiable information may be transferred to our 
successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance with 
applicable law, or if we sell one or more of our businesses, your 
personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the 
sale. If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information
 received with that business would be treated in accordance with this 
Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Sites and Others</strong></p>

<p>We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith 
that such disclosures  (a) are required by law, including, for example, 
to comply with a court order or subpoena, or  (b) will help to: enforce 
our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game 
rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and 
security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and
 security of our Sites or third parties.</p>

<p>4. <a id="14" name="14"></a><strong>How Long Does Company Keep Your Personally Identifiable Information?</strong></p>

<p>Pokémon will keep your personal information so long as you have an 
account with Pokémon, provided, however, that Pokémon will use 
commercially reasonable efforts to delete any personal information 
collected by Pokémon that is no longer relevant to your use of the Sites
 or the Services offered by Pokémon.  To the extent that you have 
installed a Pokémon application on your device, Pokémon will keep your 
personal information within such application for so long as you keep the
 application on
your device.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/privacy-policy/#top">back to top</a></p>

<p>5. <a id="15" name="15"></a><strong>What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned above, you have control over the personal information 
you submit to us. If at any time you decide to remove your personal 
information from our database, you may do so by doing the following:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p><strong>To remove your name from the Sites, log into the <a href="http://www.pokemon.com">www.pokemon.com</a>

<p><a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/privacy-policy/#top">back to top</a></p>

<p>6. <a id="16" name="16"></a><strong>What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?</strong></p>

<p>The security and confidentiality of your personal information is 
extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, 
administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personal 
information from unauthorized access and improper use. To prevent 
unauthorized electronic access to personal information, we limit access 
to only those employees performing a legitimate business function; 
maintain information collected online behind a firewall-protected 
server; verify your identity by asking you for an email address or by 
other means; store your personal information on servers separate from 
other corporate information and systems; and notify you by email if we 
learn that a breach has occurred. We also collect personal information 
from you only on SSL-protected (encrypted) web pages and it is 
transmitted over the Internet only through an SSL-protected (encrypted) 
channel. From time to time, we review our security procedures to 
consider appropriate new technology and methods. However, please 
understand that, despite our best efforts, no security measure is 
perfect or impenetrable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/privacy-policy/#top">back to top</a></p>

<p><strong>Supplemental Kids Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>Last updated February 12, 2013</p>

<p><strong>OUR ADDITIONAL PRIVACY COMMITMENT TO KIDS AND THEIR PARENTS</strong></p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: Although ESRB
Privacy Certified does not monitor non-English Websites and Services, Pokemon
makes all best efforts to ensure that non-English Websites and Services adhere
to applicable data collection guidance and principles set forth by ESRB Privacy
Certified, including adherence to the EU Directive (and US-EU Safe Harbor
principles).</p>

<p>Pokémon has developed its Sites with the goal of creating an 
enjoyable experience for all users. This Kids Privacy Policy is designed
 to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies and principles 
with respect to children under the age of 13.</p>

<p>Building on our general Privacy Policy, we recognize the need to 
provide additional privacy protections when children visit the Sites on 
which this Kids' Privacy Policy is posted. We explain those additional 
protections in this Kids' Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that 
we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and 
disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and 
that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for 
children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Sites. 
Below we explain how we do that for these "kids." Also, when we use the 
term "parent" below, we mean to include legal guardians.</p>

</ol>

<p>1. <a id="21" name="21"></a><strong>What types of information do we collect about kids?</strong></p>

<p>Kids can surf Pokémon's Sites, view content, and enjoy many features 
without any personal information being collected. We don't collect 
personal information from kids while they use our Sites unless they 
register on Pokémon's Sites.</p>

<p>We receive information from our guests and, with our guests' consent,
 from third parties such as Pokémon Organized Play ("POP") tournament 
organizers. We collect personal information directly from kids to:</p>

<ol class="list">
<li><p>create an account for Pokémon's Sites</p></li><li><p>link an account from one of Pokémon’s Sites with an account from another website operated by Pokémon or an affiliate of Pokémon</p></li>
<li><p>participate in games, reward programs, contests, sweepstakes, events, or promotions</p></li>
<li><p>send questions, correspond with us via e-mail concerning their participation in POP or request customer support</p></li>
<li><p>participate in polls, surveys, or questionnaires</p></li>
<li><p>use our Email-a-Friend feature</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Typically, this information includes:</p>

<ol class="list">
<li><p>personal first and last name</p></li>
<li><p>email address</p></li>
<li><p>telephone number</p></li>
<li><p>address and location based information (where necessary for the provision of services)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We may collect demographic information (date of birth, gender, and 
preferences) and combine it with the child's personal information. 
Pokémon will only collect this information if this information is 
provided by the parent or with the parent’s consent.</p>

<p>Note that all commercial sites directed to children under 13 are 
prohibited by U.S. law from conditioning a kid's participation in an 
online activity on the kid's providing more personal information than is
 reasonably necessary.  As a result, Pokemon will not collect more 
personal information than is reasonably necessary.</p>

<p>Finally, we may collect demographic information about a kid. For 
example, if a kid participates in a survey, we may collect those 
responses. Among them, we may collect age, gender, hobbies, interests or
 other demographic information about gaming and preferences, and the 
country where a kid lives. We also use some passive technologies, 
including cookies and web beacons, to monitor traffic on our Sites. This
 demographic information may be associated with a kid’s personal 
information that Pokemon has collected in accordance with law.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/privacy-policy/#kids">back to top</a></p>

<p>2. <a id="22" name="22"></a><strong>How do we use and share the personally identifiable information that we collect from kids?</strong></p>

<p>We may collect personal information from parents to allow kids to 
participate in certain activities offered on our Sites and within our 
kids' subscription products. These activities may include participating 
in games, reward programs, contests, sweepstakes, events or other 
promotions.</p>

<p>We may use your child's information provided by the parent or with 
the parent’s consent to allow your child to send questions or request 
customer support. We may also use that information to participate in 
polls, surveys or questionnaires. We may also use that information to 
send your child email and messages with promotional information about 
new products and features, special offers, contests and sweepstakes and 
other interesting events concerning new products, events and other 
information about Pokémon. You may always opt-out of having your child 
receive these promotional messages.</p>

<p>We may also use your child’s information provided by the parent or 
with the parent’s consent to allow use of other website features 
including sending e-mail message to "tell-a-friend" and may in the 
future permit “canned chat” where a kid is able to select words from a 
list prepared by Pokémon to send messages to other site users. If a 
parent allows us to collect personal information about their kid, we may
 link certain information collected through technology (see the 
"Information Collected Through Technology" section of A2 of our General 
Privacy Policy) to that personal information.</p>

<p>Until we receive verifiable parental consent, the contact information
 gathered from a kid is used only to obtain consent to our information 
collection practices from their parents.</p>

<p>Finally, so long as we have received parental consent, we may use a 
kid’s personal and demographic information for our other business 
purposes, such as record keeping, transaction fulfillment, and to study 
ways to better improve our services.</p>

<p>If a child wins a sweepstakes, contest or other promotional event, we
 notify the parent at the email address provided to us during the 
registration process, and request that the parent provide his or her 
postal address for purposes of delivering the prize. So long as we have 
obtained the appropriate consent, we may publish a winner's first name, 
city, and state of residence on our Sites.</p>

<p>Also if you chose to allow your child to participate in the POP tournament ratings and rankings portion of our site, <a href="http://www.pokemon.com">www.pokemon.com</a>,
 then we will use personal information about your child to track your 
child's tournament results, Player Ranking, rating, player status (e.g.,
 active, terminated, winner etc.). As parent or guardian, you can choose
 to post your child's username, full name, or first name and last 
initial, in the Player Rankings.</p>

<p>Also if you chose to allow your child to participate in the POP 
tournament ratings and rankings portion of our site, www.pokemon.com, we
 will share your personal information with independent third parties who
 run POP events (such as league leaders and tournament organizers) so 
that they can run POP events that your child may participate in. In most
 cases, these are independent third parties and not Pokémon employees. 
They've agreed to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy, but Pokémon
 cannot guarantee that these independent third parties will safeguard 
your child’s personal information. If you don't want your child’s 
personal information shared with independent third parties who run 
offline POP events, then don't allow your child to participate in the 
POP tournament ratings and rankings portion of our Sites.</p>

<p>With parental consent, Pokémon may share kids' personal information 
as necessary with outside entities hired to assist with internal website
 and support operations (e.g., online product fulfillment, email 
services, or technical support). These entities have agreed to maintain 
confidentiality, security, and integrity of all the personal information
 they obtain from us and will abide by this privacy policy. We do not 
share any information about a child with any third parties unless the 
disclosure is reasonably necessary to:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>comply with law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena;</p></li>
<li><p>enforce our Terms of Service, or Sites or game/promotion rules;</p></li>
<li><p>in connection with the purchase or sale of assets, a merger, reorganization, bankruptcy or similar corporate transaction; or</p></li>
<li><p>protect the safety and security of our Guests and our Sites.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>3. <a id="23" name="23"></a><strong>How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their kids?</strong></p>

<p>When a child under the age of 13 attempts to register with our Sites,
 we send their parent an e-mail notifying them that their child would 
like to register, and asking them to visit our Sites to grant consent 
for their child to register. If the parent ignores or refuses to 
register their child, we will delete all contact information from our 
database within 14 days of such notice. If the parent permits the 
registration, their child will be granted access to the features 
described in the notification e-mail.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/privacy-policy/#kids">back to top</a></p>

<p>4. <a id="24" name="24"></a><strong>How can parents access, change or delete personally identifiable information about their kids?</strong></p>

<p>At any time, a parent can contact our customer service department to 
access, change or delete the personal information that we have collected
 from his or her kid as follows:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p><strong>To access, change or delete the personal information about your child on the Sites, log into the <a href="http://www.pokemon.com">www.pokemon.com</a>
 site and follow the instructions to unregister or contact us at The 
Pokémon Company International, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, 
333 108th Avenue, NE, Suite 1900, Bellevue, WA 98004, Fax: +1 (425) 
274-1041.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please include the kid-member's name and the parent's e-mail address 
in the e-mail so that we can better assist you with your inquiry or 
request.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/privacy-policy/#kids">back to top</a>

</p>5. <a id="25" name="25"></a><strong>How will we notify parents if our Kids' Privacy Policy changes?</strong>
<p>We may amend our Kids' Privacy Policy at any time. We will provide 
parents notice by e-mail of any material changes in the way we intend to
 collect, use, or share kids' personal information. Please note that, at
 all times, parents should update their personal information to provide 
us current e-mail addresses. We will apply material changes in our Kids'
 Privacy Policy only in conformance with applicable law, including any 
parental consent requirements.</p>
