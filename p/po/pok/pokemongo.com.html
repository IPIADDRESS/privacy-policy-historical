<p>Welcome to Pokémon!</p>

<p>Our Privacy Commitment</p>

<p>Pokémon respects the privacy rights
of our online visitors and recognizes the importance of protecting all
information that you may choose to share with us. The policies below are
applicable to the Pokémon network of sites, including pokemon.com (including
any versions optimized for viewing on a wireless or tablet device); all email
newsletters published or distributed by Pokémon; all apps published by Pokémon,
whether for tablets, smart TVs, video game consoles, social media platforms,
mobile devices or other platforms (“Apps”); and all other interactive features,
services, and communications provided by Pokémon (“Sites”), however accessed
and/or used, that are operated by us, made available by us, or produced and
maintained by the Pokémon Company International, Inc. (collectively “Pokémon”
or “we”, “us”, or “our”). We have established this privacy policy (“Privacy
Policy”) to let you know the kinds of personal information we may gather during
your visit to these Apps and Sites (collectively, the “Services”), why we gather
your information, what we use your personal information for, when we might
disclose your personal information, and how you can manage your personal
information. </p>

<p>By accessing the Services, you agree
to be bound by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use – both of which may be
updated from time to time.  If you do not
agree to the Privacy Policy or Terms of Use (available at <a href="/us/terms-of-use/">http://www.pokemon.com/us/terms-of-use/</a> unless posted directly in the Service), please do not use
the Services.</p>

<p>We also recognize the need to
provide additional protections for children who visit and/or use our Services.
To learn about our supplemental privacy protections for kids under the age of
13, <a href="#kids">click here</a>
to read Pokémon's Kids Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy and the
certification seal shown on our Services confirm that Pokémon is a valid
licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the <a class="exit-link" href="http://www.esrb.org/privacy/faq.aspx#10" target="_blank">Entertainment
Software Rating Board's Privacy Certified Program</a> (“ESRB Privacy Certified”). The ESRB's Privacy Certified
Program is designed to ensure that our information disclosure practices are responsible
and appropriate. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this
privacy initiative and all of our Services where this Privacy Policy is posted
have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established
online information collection, use and disclosure practices. As a licensee of
this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our Services and
other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by
the ESRB.</p>

<p><em>DISCLAIMER: Although ESRB Privacy Certified does not monitor
non-English Services, Pokémon makes all best efforts to ensure that non-English
Services adhere to applicable data collection guidance and principles set forth
by ESRB Privacy Certified, including adherence to EU regulations.</em></p>

<p>Please
note that information collected on the Services is stored and processed in the
United States. By using the Services, you consent to any such transfer of
information outside of your country. Pokémon complies with the U.S.-EU Safe
Harbor Framework <em>and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework</em> as set forth
by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention
of personal information from European Union member countries <em>and
Switzerland. </em>Pokémon has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor
Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data
integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor

<p><a id="11" name="11"></a>1. What information
does this Privacy Policy cover?</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to
personal information collected on the Services where this Privacy Policy is
posted, and, unless Pokémon specifies otherwise in writing, does not apply to
any other information collected by Pokémon through any other means.</p>

<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy
applies only to information submitted and collected online, and does not apply
to information that may be collected by Pokémon offline. This Privacy Policy
applies only to Services maintained by Pokémon, and not to our international
affiliates, or any websites or apps maintained by other companies or organizations
to which we link. Pokémon is therefore not responsible for the content or
activities provided on those websites or mobile apps.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to use
and sharing of personal information collected as of the date this Privacy
Policy is posted. Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all
applicable laws.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<p><a id="12" name="12"></a>2. <strong>What types of
personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?</strong></p>

<p>Other than the technical information
required for the support of our internal operations (e.g. IP address), we don't
require personal information to access our Services. If you prefer not to
disclose personal information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features
of our Services. Personal information is information that identifies you and
may be used to contact you.</p>

<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>

<p>We receive information from our
guests and, with our guests' consent, from third parties such as Pokémon Organized
Play ("POP") tournament organizers. We collect personal information
directly from our guests when they:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Create an account for Pokémon's Services</p></li>
<li><p> Link an account from one of
Pokémon's Services with an account from another service operated by Pokémon or
an affiliate of Pokémon</p></li>
<li><p>Participate in games, reward
programs, contests, sweepstakes, events, or promotions</p></li>
<li><p> Send questions, correspond with us
via e-mail or our customer support portal concerning the Services, or their
participation in organized events</p></li>
<li><p>Participate in polls, surveys, or questionnaires</p></li>
<li><p> Use our Email-a-Friend feature</p></li>
<li><p>Provide us with business
information, such as when they apply for or have a special role in POP (such as
Pokémon professors or league or tournament organizers) or seek employment</p></li>
<li><p>Enable push notifications</p></li></ul>

<p>Typically, this information
includes:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Personal
first and last name</p></li>
<li><p>Email
address</p></li>
<li><p>Telephone number</p></li>
<li><p>Address and location based
information (where necessary for the provision of services)</p></li>
<li><p>IP address and persistent device identifier (where
necessary for the provision of services)</p></li></ul>

<p>Please also note that certain Apps
may provide users with the ability to take pictures and share them on social
media. These pictures are stripped of personal information regardless of the
user's mobile device settings and are not collected or shared by us.</p>

<p>We may, however, re-post pictures
uploaded to Twitter, Instagram and YouTube which contain a pre-determined hashtag.
By adding this tag to your picture, you are allowing us to choose to display
the picture publicly on one of our Sites. Due to the amount of content
available, we are unfortunately not able to notify individual users that their
photos have been selected. If you decide that you no longer wish to have your
photo displayed, you may: (i) take down the picture from the original website
you have posted it on; or (ii) change your profile settings to private on the
third-party website.</p>

<p>Additionally, we may also collect
other types of non-personal information (known as demographic information) such
as your age and/or date of birth, gender, the country where you live, hobbies,
and toy and game ownership preferences. This demographic information may be
associated with your personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Business Information (Including
Pokémon Professor, League or Tournament Organizer Applications)</strong></p>

<p>When you apply to be or serve as a
POP organizer, you agree that we may use any personal information submitted to
or collected by us may be used for any lawful business purpose. We may share
this personal information with independent third parties who run POP events so
that they can contact the POP organizers about participating in those events
and other POP matters. These independent third parties may not have agreed to
abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy. You should ask about such third
parties' privacy policies.</p>

<p>Any personal information submitted
to us online by job applicants, and by persons specifying that they are
submitting personal information in a business capacity, will be used solely for
its intended purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Information
Collected Through Technology</strong></p>

<p>We collect information through
technology to make our Services more interesting and useful to you. For
example, when you download one of our Apps, we collect your device ID.
Additionally, when you come to one of our Sites or download one of our Apps, we
collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal
through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet Service
Provider), your company, or your university. At times, we also use IP addresses
to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit
various parts of our Sites or enable certain mobile features like push
notifications. We may combine this information with other personally
identifiable information.</p>

<p><strong>Location Based Information</strong></p>

<p>We may collect and store your
device's source IP address which may disclose the location of your device at
the time you access the Services. Advertisements and certain content could be
directed to you as a result of this data. In addition, in some cases the Services
can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that
feature. If you enable that feature, your current location will be stored
locally on your device which will be used by the Services to serve you certain
content tied to your location. If you elect to have your location-based
searches saved to your history, we will store such information on our servers
(collectively, all location based information collected by Pokémon is “Location
Information”). You always may disable these features or withdraw your consent
to providing your Location Information. However, if you prefer not to disclose
Location Information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our Services
and in some cases may not be able to use certain Services at all.</p>

<p><a id="Cookies" name="Cookies"></a><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Our Sites also use cookies. Cookies
are pieces of information that a Site sends to your computer while you are
viewing the Site. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes.
For example, when you return to one of our Sites after logging in, cookies
provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember who you are. You
can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or
you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser
(like Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little
different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify
your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features
that make your experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some
of our services may not function properly.</p>

<p><strong>Web Beacons and Log Files</strong></p>

<p>Our Sites use a variety of technical
methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small
pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of various Sites. We
also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Sites,
such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Sites.
These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either
directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on
our behalf. Our Sites use log files to record which pages visitors to our Site
accessed, how long they stayed on the Site, where they came from and other
data. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our
guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails or clicked on
links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may
be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>

<p>Finally, once you've clicked on an
advertisement or other link and have left our Sites, our Privacy Policy no
longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the host of that site to
see how your personal information will be handled on their site.</p>

<p><strong>Push Notification</strong></p>

<p>Certain Services may give you the
option to receive push notifications.  In
order to serve push notifications, we may need to collect both your IP address
and a persistent identifier from your device. 
You can turn push notifications on or off by modifying the settings
within the applicable Service, or within your device's settings. </p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<p><a id="13" name="13"></a>3. <strong>How is your
personally identifiable information used and shared?</strong></p>

<p>We don't share, sell, or rent your
personal information to third parties without your prior consent. Other than
the technical information described earlier, we don't require personal
information to access our Services. However, if you prefer not to disclose
personal information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our Services.</p>

<p>Whatever the purpose may be, we will
only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your
requests and our legitimate business objectives.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon Online Tools and Events</strong></p>

<p>For example, if you register on our
Sites, your information will be used to provide you the benefits associated
with registration, including the ability to create a Trainer Image and to earn
Trainer Tokens. In addition, if you participate in a game, contest,
sweepstakes, or other similar event ("promotion"), the information
provided in connection with the promotion will be used to determine your entry
eligibility, to contact you with the results, and for prize fulfillment
purposes.</p>

<p><strong>POP Participants</strong></p>

<p>If you chose to participate in the
POP tournament ratings and rankings portion of our Site, <a href="/us/">www.pokemon.com</a>, then we will use your personal information about you to
track your tournament results, Player Ranking, rating, player status (e.g.,
active, terminated, winner etc.). If you are 13 and older, we will post your
full name or first name and last initial (as you direct us) and your state and
country on the appropriate Site(s) with your Player Ranking. If you are under
13, then your parent or guardian can choose to post your username, full name,
or first name and last initial in the Player Rankings.</p>

<p>Also if you chose to participate in
the POP tournament ratings and rankings portion of our Site, <a href="/us/">www.pokemon.com</a>, we will share your personal information with independent
third parties who run POP events (such as league leaders and tournament
organizers) so that they can run POP events that you may participate in. In
most cases, these are independent third parties and not Pokémon employees.
They've agreed to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy, but Pokémon cannot
guarantee that these independent third parties will safeguard your personal
information. If you don't want your personal information shared with
independent third parties who run offline POP events, then don't apply to
participate in the POP tournament ratings and rankings portion of our Site.</p>

<p><strong>Message Boards/Chat</strong></p>

<p>If you access our message boards or
chat features, we will use your personal information to enable you to view and
post messages. However, you should understand that community forums, chat, and
message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with members of the
online community. Whenever you give out personal information online in public
areas, please be aware that information can be collected and used by people you
don't know.</p>

<p>Should you wish to edit or remove information
you have previously posted to our forums, you may access the specific post you
wish to change and choose the “Edit” option or contact us directly with your
request. Please note that, we do not currently have the option to remove
specific pieces of in-game chat history. If you would like anything removed
from your chat history, we need to delete all of your chats. Removal of this
content or information from public view does not guarantee complete or
comprehensive removal. After your removal request has been honored, we may
retain copies of the content or information you have previously posted on our

these companies may have access to your personally identifying information.
These entities have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and

<p><strong>Transfer of Personal Information
from Application to Pokémon</strong></p>

<p>To the extent that you have
installed a Pokémon App on your device but have not created a user account,
except as disclosed below, the personal information collected by the App
remains on the device and is not provided to Pokémon. Pokémon will have access
to your personal information or your personal information will be transferred
to Pokémon's servers in any of the following circumstances:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Pokémon may also access certain data from the App,
including without limitation the user supplied information and device
information, for statistical analysis. All such data has been anonymized
prior to Pokémon's collection and storage.</p></li></ul>

<p><strong>Use of Your Location Information</strong></p>

<p>We may only use and share your
Location Information in conjunction with our right described in “Disclosures
Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Services
and Others” below and to:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Customize the default country and default language to
show you the products and services in your chosen language and country</p></li>
<li><p>Provide you with the products and services you request</p></li>
<li><p>Personalize content and experiences on our Services, including
providing you recommendations based on your preferences</p></li>
<li><p>Personalize your newsletters, offers and promotions for
our products and services, third party products and services, or special
events</p></li>
<li><p>Personalize the advertising you receive, including advertising
based on your activity on our Sites or activity on third party sites and
applications</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize or improve our products, services and
operations</p></li>
<li><p>Detect, investigate, and prevent activities that may
violate our policies or be illegal</p></li>
<li><p>Perform statistical, demographic, and marketing
analyses of users of the Sites and their purchasing patterns</p></li></ul>

<p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong></p>

<p>Finally, we may take your personally
identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by
combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your
information with information about other individuals), or by removing
characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally
identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of
this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right
to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and
share in any way with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable
information.</p>

<p><strong>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</strong></p>

<p>In the event of a merger, sale of
assets, acquisition, dissolution, reorganization, bankruptcy, change of control
or other similar event, your personally identifiable information may be
transferred to our successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance
with applicable law, or if we sell one or more of our businesses, your
personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the sale.
If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received
with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if
it is practicable and permissible to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosures Required By Law and
Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Services and Others</strong></p>

<p>We will disclose personal
information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are
required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or
subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest,
sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security,
including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or,
protect the safety and security of our Services or websites or mobile
applications belonging to third parties.</p>

<p><a id="14" name="14"></a>4.
<strong>How Long Does Company Keep Your
Personally Identifiable Information?</strong></p>

<p>Pokémon will keep your personal
information so long as you have an account with Pokémon, provided, however,
that Pokémon will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete any personal
information collected by Pokémon that is no longer relevant to your use of the
Services offered by Pokémon. To the extent that you have installed a Pokémon App
on your device, Pokémon will keep your personal information within such App for
so long as you keep the App on your device.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<p><a id="15" name="15"></a>5. <strong>What choices do
you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable
information?</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned above, you have control
over the personal information you submit to us. If at any time you decide to
remove your personal information from our database, you may do so by doing the

<p><a id="16" name="16"></a>6. <strong>What kinds of
security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable
information?</strong></p>

<p>The security and confidentiality of
your personal information is extremely important to us. We have implemented
technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your
personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. To prevent
unauthorized electronic access to personal information, we limit access to only
those individuals performing a legitimate business function; maintain
information collected online behind a firewall-protected server; verify your
identity by asking you for an email address or by other means; store your
personal information on servers separate from other corporate information and
systems; and notify you by email if we learn that a breach has occurred. We
also collect personal information from you only on SSL-protected (encrypted) access
points and it is transmitted over the Internet only through an SSL-protected
(encrypted) channel. From time to time, we review our security procedures to
consider appropriate new technology and methods. However, please understand
that, despite our best efforts, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable.</p>

<p><strong><a id="kids" name="kids"></a>Supplemental
Kids Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>Last updated April 19, 2016</p>

<p><strong>OUR ADDITIONAL PRIVACY COMMITMENT TO
KIDS AND THEIR PARENTS</strong></p>

<p>Pokémon has developed its Services
with the goal of creating an enjoyable experience for all users. This Kids'
Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy
policies and principles with respect to children under the age of 13.</p>

<p>Building on our general Privacy Policy,
we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when children
visit the Services on which this Kids' Privacy Policy is posted. We explain
those additional protections in this Kids' Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>The Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act ("COPPA") and the new regulations implementing it
(“COPPA Rule”) require that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we
collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of
age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for
children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Services. Below
we explain how we do that for these "kids." Also, when we use the
term "parent" below, we mean to include legal guardians.</p>

<p><a id="21" name="21"></a>1. <strong>What types of
information do we collect about kids?</strong></p>

<p>Kids can use Pokémon's Services,
view content, and enjoy many features without any personal information being
collected. We don't knowingly collect personal information from kids while they
use our Services unless they register on Pokémon's Services and we have
obtained verifiable parental consent.</p>

<p>We receive information from our
guests and, with our guests' consent, from third parties such as “Play! Pokémon”
organized play ("POP") tournament organizers. We collect personal
information from parents on behalf of their kids to create an account for
Pokemon's Services. Additionally, we may collect personal information from all
users to:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Link an account from one of
Pokémon's Services with an account from another Service operated by Pokémon or
an affiliate of Pokémon</p></li>
<li><p>Participate in games, reward
programs, contests, sweepstakes, events, or promotions</p></li>
<li><p>Send questions, correspond with us
via e-mail or our customer support portal concerning the Services, or their
participation in organized events</p></li>
<li><p>Participate in polls, surveys, or questionnaires</p></li>
<li><p>Use our Email-a-Friend feature</p></li>
<li><p>Enable push notifications</p></li></ul>

<p>If a user has indicated that they
are a kid when trying to create a Pokémon account, we will collect a parent's
email address and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting any
additional personal information from or about the kid. Typically, the personal
information we may collect across our Services includes:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Personal first and last name</p></li>
<li><p>Email address</p></li>
<li><p>Telephone number</p></li>
<li><p>Address and location based
information (where necessary for the provision of services)</p></li>
<li><p>IP address and persistent device
identifier (where necessary for the provision of services)</p></li></ul>

<p>We may collect demographic
information (date of birth, gender, and preferences) and combine it with the
child's personal information. Pokémon will only collect this information if
this information is provided by the parent or with the parent's consent.</p>

<p> We also use some passive technologies, including
cookies and Web beacons, to monitor traffic on our Sites. This demographic
information may be associated with a kid's personal information that Pokémon
has collected in accordance with law.</p>

<p>Note that all commercial sites
directed to children under 13 are prohibited by COPPA from conditioning a kid's
participation in an online activity on the kid's providing more personal
information than is reasonably necessary. While some Pokémon Services and
features may be geared towards users above the age of 13, Pokémon will not
collect more personal information than is reasonably necessary on any of the
Services.</p>

<p><a href="#kids">back to top</a></p>

<p><a id="22" name="22"></a>2. <strong>How do we use
and share the personally identifiable information that we collect from kids?</strong></p>

<p>We may collect personal information
from parents to allow kids to participate in certain activities offered on our Services
and within our kids' subscription products. These activities may include
participating in games, reward programs, contests, sweepstakes, events or other
promotions.</p>

<p>We may use your child's information
provided by the parent or with the parent's consent to allow your child to send
questions or request customer support. We may also use that information to
participate in polls, surveys or questionnaires. With parental consent, we may
also use that information to send your child email and messages with
promotional information about new products and features, special offers,
contests and sweepstakes and other interesting information concerning new
products, events and other updates about Pokémon. You may always opt-out of
having your child receiving these promotional messages by visiting your account
profile settings or contacting us.</p>

<p>We may also use your child's
information provided by the parent or with the parent's consent to allow use of
other Site features including sending email message to
"tell-a-friend" and may permit “canned chat” where a kid is able to select
words from a list prepared by Pokémon to send messages to other Site users. If
a parent allows us to collect personal information about their kid, we may link
certain information collected through technology (see the "<a href="#12">Information Collected Through
Technology</a>" section 2 of our general
Privacy Policy) to that personal information. Please also review the “<a href="#Cookies">Cookies</a>” area within the same section to learn more about the third
party service providers we use across our Services for analytics purposes,
including how you may opt-out of their services.</p>

<p>Until we receive verifiable parental
consent, the contact information gathered from a kid is used only to obtain
consent to our information collection practices from their parents.</p>

<p>Finally, so long as we have received
parental consent, we may use a kid's personal and demographic information for
our other business purposes, such as record keeping, transaction fulfillment,
and to study ways to better improve our services.</p>

<p>If a child wins a sweepstakes,
contest or other promotional event, we notify the parent at the email address
provided to us during the registration process, and request that the parent
provide his or her postal address for purposes of delivering the prize. So long
as we have obtained the appropriate consent, we may publish a winner's first
name, city, and state of residence on our Sites.</p>

<p>Also if you chose to allow your
child to participate in the POP tournament ratings, leaderboard and rankings portion
of our Site, <a href="/us/">www.pokemon.com</a>,
then we will use personal information about your child to track your child's
tournament results, Player Ranking, rating, player status (e.g., active,
terminated, winner etc.). As parent or guardian, you can choose to post your
child's username, full name, or first name and last initial, in the Player
Rankings.</p>

<p>Also if you chose to allow your
child to participate in the POP tournament ratings and rankings portion of our Site,
www.pokemon.com, we will share your personal information with independent third
parties who run POP events (such as league leaders and tournament organizers)
so that they can run POP events that your child may participate in. In most
cases, these are independent third parties and not Pokémon employees. They've
agreed to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy, but Pokémon cannot
guarantee that these independent third parties will safeguard your child's
personal information. If you don't want your child's personal information
shared with independent third parties who run offline POP events, then don't
allow your child to participate in the POP tournament ratings and rankings
portion of our Sites.</p>

<p>With parental consent, Pokémon may
share kids' personal information as necessary with outside entities hired to
assist with internal Service and support operations (e.g., online product
fulfillment, email services, moderation, or technical support). These entities
have agreed to maintain confidentiality, security, and integrity of all the
personal information they obtain from us and will abide by this privacy policy.
If you or your child consents to receive push notifications, such outside entities
may be used to collect the IP address and persistent identifier from your
device.  You can turn push notification
on or off by modifying the settings within the applicable Service, or within
your device's settings. </p>

<p>We do not share any information
about a child with any third parties unless the disclosure is reasonably
necessary to:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>comply with law, including, for example, to comply with
a court order or subpoena;</p></li>
<li><p>enforce our Terms of Use, or rules applying to our
Services or games/promotions;</p></li>
<li><p>in connection with the purchase or sale of assets, a
merger, reorganization, bankruptcy or similar corporate transaction; or</p></li>
<li><p>protect the safety and security of our guests and our Services.</p></li></ul>

<p><a href="#kids">back to top</a></p>

<p><a id="23" name="23"></a>3. <strong>How do we
notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of personal
information from their kids?</strong></p>

<p>When a child under the age of 13
attempts to register with our Services, we send their parent an email notifying
them that their child would like to register, and ask them to create an account
to grant consent for their child to register. If the parent ignores or refuses
to register their child, we will delete all contact information from our
database within 14 days of such notice. If the parent permits the registration,
their child will be granted access to the features described in the
notification email.</p>

<p>While the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accepts
several different methods of collecting verifiable parental consent, Pokemon,
in conjunction with Veratad, a leading age and Identity Verification company,
asks for the sum of the first and last digit of your social security number as
well as other pieces of information to verify your identity, such as name,
birth date, and physical address. Note that Pokémon does NOT store this
information anywhere in our records.</p>

<p><a href="#kids">back to top</a></p>

<p><a id="24" name="24"></a>4. <strong>How can parents
access, change or delete personally identifiable information about their kids?</strong></p>

<p>At any time, a parent can contact
our customer service department to access, change or delete the personal
information that we have collected from his or her kid as follows:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p><strong>To access, change or delete the personal information
about your child on the Services, log into the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://</span><a href="/us/">support.pokemon.com</a>
Site and submit a customer service request, or contact us at The Pokémon
Company International, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, 601 108th
Avenue, NE, Suite 1600, Bellevue, WA 98004, legalnotices@pokemon.com.</strong></p></li></ul>


<p>Please include the kid's username
and the parent's email address in the email so that we can better assist you
with your inquiry or request.</p>

<p><a href="#kids">back to top</a></p>

<p><a id="25" name="25"></a>5. <strong>How will we
notify parents if our Kids' Privacy Policy changes?</strong></p>

<p>We may amend our Kids' Privacy
Policy at any time. We will provide parents notice by email of any material
changes in the way we intend to collect, use, or share kids' personal
information. Please note that, at all times, parents should update their
personal information to provide us current email addresses. We will apply
material changes in our Kids' Privacy Policy only in conformance with
applicable law, including any parental consent requirements.</p>
