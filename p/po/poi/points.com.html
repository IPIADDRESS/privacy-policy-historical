				<h3>Links to 3rd Party Sites</h3>
				
				<p>
					Our website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Points.com. If you submit Personal Information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
				</p>
				





				<h3>Social Media Widgets</h3>

					Our web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook button and Widgets, among other things. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.

					Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
				</p>
				





				<h3>Single Sign-On</h3>

				</p>
				




				
				<h3>Cookies and Tracking Devices</h3>
			

<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies on Points.com. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We set a persistent cookie to only store your username, so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our Points.com. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. If you reject cookies, you may still use Points.com, but your ability to use some areas, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.</p>

<p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers may use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate or sign-in to Points.com.</p>

<p>We and our third party providers also employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known tracking pixels), that help us better manage content on Points.com by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>

<p>We and our third-party service providers, including ad networks, use the information that we collect about you to serve advertisements to you on various marketing channels, including but not limited to websites and mobile apps. You can learn more about interest-based advertising and also opt out of our vendors' and other advertisers' use of Cookies to tailor content or advertising to you by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>


				



				<h3>Email</h3>

				When you send us an email or when you ask us to respond to you by email, we collect your exact email address and any information you have included in the email message.
<p>We use your email address to acknowledge your comments and/or reply to your questions, and we will store your communication and our reply in case we correspond further. We may use your email address to send you information about offers on products or special promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. If you don’t want us to contact you by email with offers on products and special promotions, you may tell us by selecting the unsubscribe option at the bottom of the communication.</p>

<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients or to allow us to serve you related advertising on the Internet. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>Remember that email sent over the Internet is generally unencrypted and transmitted in clear text. We recommend that you use caution when forwarding free-format email messages to us and that you do not include confidential information (such as unique user IDs, passwords or personally identifiable information) in those messages. Confidential information should be transmitted to us through other secure methods as defined by Points.com</p>




				<h3>Service Providers</h3>
				<p>
					We use the services of various third party companies and contractors (referred to here as "service providers") in the conduct of our business. These service providers provide us with payment processing services, information technology services for our software applications, marketing and survey services and other essential services. These service providers may, from time to time, collect, use, store, disclose and process Personal Information on our behalf only as necessary to provide services to us, including for marketing purposes to communicate with you and to serve advertisements to you on Partner program offers that may be of interest to you. These service providers are located in various jurisdictions including, among others, Canada, the United States and the European Union and, as a result, your Personal Information may be stored, processed or transferred into or out of these countries. We take reasonable measures and precautions to protect your Personal Information when it is being handled by our service providers. If you wish to obtain more information on our use of service providers and our policies and practices regarding such service providers, please contact us as set forth below.
				</p>
				



				<h3>Business Transactions</h3>
				<p>
					We may use and disclose your Personal Information in connection with the proposed or actual financing, sale or other business transaction involving part or all of our business or assets. Such use and disclosure would be for the purpose of allowing third parties to determine whether to proceed with the proposed transaction, and if the transaction proceeds, for the purpose of completing the transaction. Assignees or successors to our business or assets may use and disclose your Personal Information for the purposes described in this policy. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.
				</p>
				



				<h3>Your Consent</h3>
			
			<p>In accordance with applicable privacy legislation, by providing us with your consent to this privacy policy, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information for the purposes identified in this policy, or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection.</p>

<p>You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use or disclosure at any time, provided that if you withdraw your consent to certain uses, we may no longer be able to provide our services to you.</p>

				



				<h3>Sweepstakes, Contests, Promotions and Surveys</h3>
	<p>From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes, contests, surveys and other promotions. Any Personal Information submitted in connection with such activities will be treated in accordance with this policy, except as specifically set forth in the rules, terms or conditions for those sweepstakes, contests, surveys or promotions.</p>
				


				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p>Personal Information transmitted to our website is using industry standard encryption, which creates a private conversation between your computer and our site. We authenticate our website and enable TLS/SSL encryption to protect your sensitive data and transactions. No method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure and as such we cannot guarantee absolute security for the transmission of your Personal Information.</p>
				


				<h3>Data Retention</h3>
				<p>
					We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services <a target="_blank" href="http://questions.points.com/home">contact us here</a>. We will retain and use your Personal Information after closure of your account as necessary to meet legal, regulatory, insurance and audit requirements.
				
				</p>
				


				<h3>Accuracy</h3>
