<h3>FOR VISITORS TO THIS WEBSITE (THE "SITE")</h3>
<p><b>Collection on the Site.</b> PointRoll collects aggregate and Non-Personal Information that is generated automatically as a user navigates through the Site.  For example, we collect information about how many times a particular page within our Site is visited and which features of the Site users interact with.  This information does not identify an individual, but tells us how many users visited the Site and used its features.  By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor the Site to our visitors.  PointRoll may collect Non-Personal Information of users through a variety of technologies and practices including PointRoll's browser cookies, web beacons or similar technologies, or a third party's browser cookies. A cookie is a small file that can be automatically stored on a computer when the computer's browser views an advertisements or a website.  </p>
<p>In addition, PointRoll may collect information (including Personal Information, such as email addresses) that users supply voluntarily on the Site, such as when a user signs up for electronic newsletters or other email from PointRoll. If you do not consent to this collection of your Personal Information, do not provide any Personal Information on this Site.  </p>
<p><b>Use of Information Collected on the Site.</b> PointRoll may use any information submitted on the Site by a user for the purpose for which the information was submitted and any purpose related to the Site, including to understand how users interact with the Site, to contact the user for customer service purposes, to inform the user of important changes or additions to the Site or the services offered by the Site, and to send the user administrative notices and any other communications that PointRoll believes may be of interest to the user.</p>
<p>If you have subscribed to one or more of our email newsletters, you also may change your subscriber information, modify your subscriptions, and/or unsubscribe from these communications at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in the email you receive. <b>Links to Other Sites.</b> The Site may include links to other websites. Those websites will have their own privacy policies that you may wish to review. PointRoll has no responsibility for these linked websites.</p>
<p><b>Sharing and Disclosing Information.</b>PointRoll may share and disclose information that PointRoll collects to service providers or Publishers for the purpose of providing services requested on the Site by a user. PointRoll also may occasionally release information that PointRoll collects in order to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property or safety of advertisers, publishers, users, the public or PointRoll. Also, in the event that PointRoll sells some or all of its assets, reorganizes, is liquidated, or is acquired by another company, information that PointRoll collects may be among the transferred assets.</p>
<p><b>Access and Correction.</b>  PointRoll will provide reasonable access and correction rights regarding Personal Information in response to inquiries directed to: Mark Faris, Online Privacy Coordinator, PointRoll, Gannett Law Department, 7950 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, VA 22107.</p>
<p><b>Security.</b> The security of your information is very important to us. All information we gather on the Site is stored on secure servers and our internal systems. However, as effective as the reasonable security measures implemented by us may be, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our Site's servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. You play a role in protecting your information as well. Because your password permits access to your personal information, please keep your password secret and do not disclose it to others. </p>
<p><b>Children's Privacy Statement.</b>  PointRoll does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from a child under 13.  </p>
<h3>ADVERTISING SERVED THROUGH POINTROLL AND POINTROLL AD DELIVERY OR MARKETING SERVICES OFF OF THIS SITE</h3>
<p><b>PointRoll makes digital advertising better -- for the Advertiser and for the Viewer.</b> Our technology enables Advertisers and Publishers to better market to consumers with more relevant and engaging digital advertising so that consumers who view PointRoll Ads ("Viewers") receive advertising that is of greater interest to them. In serving PointRoll Ads, PointRoll adheres to all applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations. The descriptions below explain our privacy practices with regard to advertising that PointRoll creates and delivers for our customers, and which appear on many different websites, applications and other digital platforms.</p>
<p><b>Collection within PointRoll Ads.</b> PointRoll may collect and store Non-Personal Information that is generated automatically as a Viewer sees and interacts with PointRoll Ads. At the request of Advertisers or Publishers, PointRoll may also assist in the collection of Non-Personal Information of Viewers by third parties conducting research.</p> 
<p>In certain cases, at the request of an Advertiser or Publisher, a PointRoll Ad may be designed to enable the collection of Personal Information from Viewers, such as a location (town of residence or zip code), gender, or email address, from within the PointRoll Ad. If you do not consent to collection of your PI, do not supply any Personal Information in a PointRoll Ad. Any PI about a Viewer that is collected by a PointRoll Ad is provided to the Advertiser or Publisher or its authorized service provider and is not used by PointRoll for any other purpose. The Advertiser or Publisher's collection and use of the PI of Viewers is defined by the Advertiser or Publisher's privacy policy. PointRoll is not responsible for Advertisers' or Publishers' privacy or information practices.</p> 
<p>In some cases, a Viewer may choose to provide information about another person through a PointRoll Ad. For example, a PointRoll Ad may provide the functionality through which a Viewer may choose to provide a friend's email address in order to forward a PointRoll Ad to a friend. As with any PI that the Viewer supplies about him or herself, any PI about another person that is collected by a PointRoll Ad is provided to the Advertiser or Publisher or its authorized service provider and is not used by PointRoll for any other purpose. The Advertiser or Publisher's collection and use of the Personal Information of friends is defined by the Advertiser or Publisher's privacy policy. PointRoll is not responsible for Advertisers' or Publishers' privacy or information practices.</p> 
<p>In some cases, information that is voluntarily supplied by users within a PointRoll Ad in connection with certain third-party services is provided to the third party. The third party's collection and use of the information of Viewers is defined by that third party's privacy policy. PointRoll is not responsible for the third party's privacy or information practices. </p> 
<p><b>Non-Personal Information Collected within PointRoll Ads and from Other Sources.</b> PointRoll may use Non-Personal Information of Viewers collected within PointRoll Ads to better target advertisements, improve the user experience, including to better direct PointRoll Ads to specific types of visitors, and/or to measure ad effectiveness. </p>
<p>PointRoll may collect Non-Personal Information of Viewers through a variety of technologies and practices including PointRoll's or other third party's browser cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. A cookie is a small file that can be automatically stored on a computer when the computer's browser views an advertisements or a website.  For example, PointRoll may use cookies to collect Non-Personal Information, such as the approximate geographic location of the Viewer based on their IP address, the most recent Publisher websites that the Viewer's browser has visited, any PointRoll Ads that the Viewer has viewed or on which the Viewer has clicked.  These data points are used alone or in combination to enable us to make inferences about a Viewer  (e.g., based on websites visited and ads clicked, Viewer is likely to a woman) or their preferences (e.g., based on websites visited and ads clicked, Viewer appears to like travel), so that we can better direct our advertising. We do not, however, make any attempt to serve targeted advertising by inferring health conditions. </p>
<p>In addition, PointRoll or the companies with which it does online business may use interest-based and demographic data from third parties to help determine which PointRoll Ad is served to a particular Viewer. For example, geographic and purchase intent information passed from publishers via a cookie to PointRoll may be used to deliver a geographically or product specific creative message to a consumer.  A non-personally identifiable numeric code is shared via the data provider to the ad unit at run time via a cookie, which communicates (for example) a specific geographic area that is in turn read via the cookie by the PointRoll platform that will then select and serve the appropriate creative or message element associated with that geography. PointRoll retains OBA data in the cookie for up to 2 years, after which time the cookie is expired and the data is deleted.</p>
<p>PointRoll Ads are delivered via Privacy Preferences Projects ("P3P")-compliant servers that communicate the details of PointRoll's targeting advertising practices to P3P-enabled web browsers.  </p>
<a name="optout"></a>
<p><b>Your Choices and Opting Out of Behavioral Advertising.</b> PointRoll respects consumer choices and preferences, and is committed to providing ways for Viewers to control their online experience.  A Viewer can Opt Out of receiving cookies that enable the Viewer's browser to receive targeted PointRoll ads by clicking <a href="#" onclick="Opt('out');return false;">here</a> or on the Opt-Out image below. </p>
<p>If a Viewer changes his or her mind after opting out (because he or she decides receiving tailored advertising is preferable to receiving generic ads), the Viewer can opt in by clicking the Opt-In link below.</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> 
	<tbody> 
		<tr> 
			<td><a href="#" onclick="Opt('out');return false;"><img alt="Opt-Out" border="0" src="/images/btn_optout.gif"></a> </td> 
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> 
			<td><a href="#" onclick="Opt('in');return false;"><img alt="Opt-In" border="0" src="/images/btn_optin.gif"></a> </td>
		</tr> 
	</tbody> 
</table>
<p>Note: This Opt-Out process provides a PointRoll opt-out cookie to the user's browser. Therefore, if cookies are disabled, erased, or altered, or browser and/or machine software is changed, then the results of this opt-out process may be undone, and the Opt-Out will need to be performed again. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the Viewer's web browser may allow a user to disable cookies. To disable cookies using Internet Explorer, select "Internet Options" under the Tools menu and click on "Privacy." Select "High" or "Block All Cookies." To disable cookies using Mozilla Firefox, select "Options" under the "Tools" menu. To check your cookie setting on Safari, select "Preferences" from the Safari menu, and then select either "Privacy" (versions 5.1 and later) or "Security" (versions 5.0.x and earlier).   PointRoll does not use Flash Cookies but Adobe's Flash Player Settings Manager allows you to customize the websites which you allow to use local storage ("Flash Cookies").  If a user chooses to disable cookies, a user may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the PointRoll Ads. </p>
<p>Depending on the Viewer's individual browser settings, some anti-spyware software programs may erroneously flag PointRoll advertisements or cookies as computer threats. PointRoll does not distribute viruses or any computer code that monitors or causes changes to users' computer system registries as part of its advertisements or cookies. </p>
<p><b>Further Options for Obtaining Information About Your Choices and Opting Out of Behavioral Advertising.  </b>PointRoll participates in industry self-regulatory groups and adheres to guidelines such as those of the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</a>, a cooperative of companies committed to building responsible advertising policies across the Internet.</p>
<p>PointRoll is also a member of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)</a> and is in compliance with all NAI Principles.  Users can obtain information about advertising service providers' information collection practices, and opt out of such practices (and at the same time opt out of the collection practices of other, or all, NAI members) by following the opt out instructions at  <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>. </p>
<p>Note, however, that certain opt-out functionality may require that third-party cookies be permitted.  For example, the DAA cookie-blocking function cannot be utilized by a user with a Safari browser that is set to block third-party cookies (which is the default setting). However, the user may be able to change the settings temporarily to accept a DAA third-party cookie, and then restore the Safari default setting to block new third party cookies.</p>
<p><b>Sharing and Disclosing Information.</b> PointRoll may share the information collected in a PointRoll Ad with the Advertiser. For example, if a user has opted in to receive email marketing from the Advertiser, PointRoll will share information collected in the Advertiser's PointRoll Ad with that Advertiser. PointRoll may occasionally release information that PointRoll collects from PointRoll Ads in order to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property or safety of advertisers, publishers, users, the public or PointRoll. Also, in the event that PointRoll sells some or all of its assets, or PointRoll is acquired by another company, information that PointRoll collects may be among the transferred assets.</p>
