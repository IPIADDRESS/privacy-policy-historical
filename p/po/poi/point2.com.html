                        <br>
                        Personal information is broadly defined as information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title,
                        business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization. Data collected with personal identifiers removed,
                        so that it is impossible to determine the identity of the person to whom the information relates, is not considered personal information.

                        a long-lasting relationship with you that will grow and change to meet your needs.
                        With your permission, we collect personal information about you to:

                        <br>
                        The cornerstone to protecting your privacy is consent. We will only collect, use and
                        disclose your personal information with your consent, except where otherwise permitted by law.
                        We do not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service to you, require you to consent
                        to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information beyond that information which
                        is required to provide our services to you.
                        <br><br>
                        You may choose not to provide us with any of your personal information. However, if you make this
                        choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service or information that you requested
                        or that could be offered to you.

                        <br>
                        Consent can be express or it may be implied in appropriate circumstances.
                        <br><br>
                        Express Consent can be given in writing, in person, electronically, by telephone or by using a check-off box.
                        <br><br>
                        Implied Consent occurs when surrounding circumstances exist that lead a reasonable person to believe that this
                        consent had been given, although no direct, express or explicit words of agreement are transmitted.

                        If you withdraw consent, we will inform you of the implications of such withdrawal.
                        To withdraw consent, simply contact us and advise us of what personal information you no longer wish us to use.

                        Yardi Systems, Inc. and its affiliated entities (“Yardi”) is committed to protecting the privacy of

                        and other users of and visitors to Yardi websites (collectively, “Visitors”).
                        Central to this mission is providing a robust security and privacy program that carefully considers
                        data protection matters across the suite of products and services offered by Yardi (“Yardi Services” or “Services”),

                        <br>
                        This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices regarding information we collect from individuals (“you” or “your”)
                        who visit the Yardi Sites. When we collect personal data on the Yardi Sites, certain additional disclosures, that are specific
                        to the context of our collection and use of the information being collected (e.g. an event or seminar registration page),
                        may be provided to you. For the avoidance of any doubt, we will adhere to those commitments and any such additional privacy
                        policy statements are hereby incorporated into this Privacy Statement.

                        <br>
                        Yardi’s confidentiality/privacy and other obligations with respect to its Services, and Client Data (as defined in the agreements
                        for those Services), are governed solely by the agreements under which the Services are provided to our Clients. The traditional
                        licensees of Yardi Services are residential and commercial real estate property owners and property managers (again, collectively,
                        as used in this Privacy Statement, “Yardi Clients” or “Clients”). The other actors in the real estate economy are, of course, the
                        residents, tenants and providers of various services for, or at, the buildings Yardi Clients own and manage.  Yardi Services
                        (by means of example only, the Yardi Voyager web-based, fully integrated end-to-end platform product suite) help our Clients manage
                        their real estate and other assets by, among other things, facilitating communication and transactions between Yardi Clients and
                        their tenants and service providers. Yardi generally has no direct relationship with the individuals to whom our Clients’ Client Data
                        may pertain; Yardi merely hosts or processes such data on behalf of our Clients. Any uses of Client Data by Yardi are done so pursuant
                        to the subscription agreement in place between Yardi and the relevant Yardi Client, or Yardi’s applicable Terms of Service, which
                        exclusively govern Yardi’s treatment of Client Data. This Privacy Statement does not apply to Yardi Services or Client Data. If you have
                        any questions about the data practices of a Yardi Client, using Yardi Services to process your personal information, you need to contact
                        the Yardi Client directly, and ask for their Privacy Policy or Privacy Statement. In other words, Yardi is a data processor and not a data
                        controller with respect to Client Data. Yardi Clients make all decisions about how or why Client Data, containing personal information or
                        not, is to be processed, including any disclosure or transmission to third parties. If personal information pertaining to you as an
                        individual has been submitted or entered into a Yardi Service by or on behalf of a Yardi Client, or was otherwise collected by a
                        Yardi Service on behalf of a Yardi Client, and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete such
                        Client Data, please inquire with the Yardi Client directly. If an authorized Yardi Client requests that we update or remove the data in
                        question and the Client has no ability to do so via use of the Services, we will acknowledge their request within 30 days.

                        <br>
                        Some Yardi Services enable Yardi Clients to create websites and applications that run natively on the Yardi platform. One such example
                        are RENTCafé resident portals, which facilitate communication and transactions between Yardi Clients and their potential or actual tenants.
                        Such websites are controlled by Yardi Clients, and as described above, any information submitted to or collected by such websites is
                        Client Data to which this Privacy Statement does not apply. The terms of service and privacy policy of the third party Yardi Client governs
                        such websites.
                        <br> <br>
                        Yardi is committed to promoting privacy principles and providing as much information to individuals as legally and contractually possible
                        about the processing of their personal data. In that light, some Yardi Client-controlled websites that are created and maintained by
                        Yardi Services may include privacy statements directly from Yardi to the users of such websites. Yardi is committed to adhering to such
                        privacy statements. We provide these statements, or disclosures to identify Yardi as the data processor/technology platform, to disclose
                        Yardi’s privacy practices with respect to such Client Data, and to inform the user to seek information about the privacy practices governing
                        the website directly from the corresponding Yardi Client. To be clear, Yardi’s privacy statements on such Yardi Client controlled websites
                        are applicable only to Yardi, and not the Yardi Client. In such privacy statements, Yardi discloses how Yardi uses and processes the
                        information collected by and submitted to the website controlled by the Yardi Client. For the avoidance of any doubt, if you submitted
                        personal data to a Yardi Client-controlled website created and maintained by Yardi Services (e.g. RENTCafé resident portals) and you wish
                        to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete such Client Data, please inquire with the Yardi Client directly.
                        <br> <br>
                        Some Yardi Sites may be created and managed by Yardi Clients. Most of these websites are not accessible via the public internet. Regardless,
                        please know that this Privacy Statement is not applicable to those websites, which are instead governed by the privacy statement of the
                        Yardi Client that creates and manages the website. In addition, the Yardi Sites may contain links to other third-party websites.
                        The information practices or content of such other websites is governed by the privacy statements of such other websites.
