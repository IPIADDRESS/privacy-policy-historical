        Auctions.com Privacy Statement</font></b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Here are important FAQs on PoliceAuctions.com and the information
the 
        site collects</b>.<br>
        <br>
        PoliceAuctions.com, published by privately held Vortal Group, Inc., is

        an online directory of government and non-government auctions. The
information 
        we gather cannot be used by the public, including visitors, other
members, 
        or anyone not employed by Vortal Group, Inc. or the financial
institutions 
        used to process membership charges, to identify specific individuals. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We collect credit card, address, or bank information only from those
who 
        choose to join the service at the paid subscription level. <br>

        <br>
        <b>What type of information does PoliceAuctions.com Collect?</b> <br>
        <br>
        There are two types of information that PoliceAuctions.com collects.
One, 
        information users submit to us and two, information not directly
submitted 
        by users.<br>
        <br>
        <b>User Information submitted to PoliceAuctions.com</b><br>
        <br>

        The user information submitted to PoliceAuctions.com is separated into

        two categories: Public and Private. The Public information is the
personal 
        information that may be displayed on the site at the discretion of the

        user, such as username or email address in connection with a voluntary

        posting by the user on a message board, chat or other public posting
through 
        the system. The Private information is the user's email address and
credit 
        card information. <br>
        <br>
        <b>User Information that's Private:</b><br>
        <br>
        Private information is the user's email address, and credit card or
other 
        payment information which could include first name, last name, credit 
        card number or checking account information for payment, a
user-specified 
        password, mailing address, zip code and telephone number.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Surveys</b><br>

        <br>
        All participation in our surveys is voluntary and is anonymous.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Affiliate Partners for PoliceAuctions.com</b><br>
        <br>
        PoliceAuctions.com's Affiliate program allows other sites to link to
the 
        PoliceAuctions.com site. No personal member information is exchanged
with 
        the Affiliate Partner, with the following exception: Sites that
incentivize 
        their members to join PoliceAuctions.com require those users' email
addresses 
        for verification. PoliceAuctions.com sends the users' email address
back 
        to the referring site so they can track their incentives.
PoliceAuctions.com 
        may create mirror versions of its site that draw from the same
database. 
        Those sites will display user's public information under the same
conditions 
        as the primary PoliceAuctions.com site. <br>
        <br>

        <b>User Information not Directly Submitted to PoliceAuctions.com</b>
<br>
