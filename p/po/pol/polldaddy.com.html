            						<br>
						To protect the customer resources area from misuse we actively monitor all logins into the system in addition to recording standard web logs. We collect login dates and times as well as recording IP addresses on an individual basis. In addition, we record details on all actions that are taken, also on an individual basis. This allows us to perform individual analysis of patterns of activity for the purposes of detecting prohibited access and misuse of the resources in the system. <br>
						<br>
						Support facilities are provided to assist users who may have problems logging in. This may involve the user emailing to us their contact and original order information in order to provide proof of purchase. While this information is usually discarded once the request has been fulfilled, it may be retained indefinitely in special circumstances where it might prove useful to compile a past history of such requests, for example if we suspect that a user is attempting to gain access fraudulently. <br>
						<br>
						To expedite the handling of priority support e-mail's we may record computer and browser information. This allows us to quickly deal with common problems arising from incompatible system settings, for example if we detect that a user's browser does not support cookies. <br>
						<br>
						Customers may provide suggestions via the customer feedback facility and this information may be retained indefinitely in order to serve as a valuable repository of ideas for future products and services.<br>
						<br>
						Customers may view and edit their personal contact information and preferences. We may use this information to market new releases and upgrades, and for general customer announcements. <br>
