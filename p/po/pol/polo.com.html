      <p>Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operations 
        of Polo.com, we gather certain types of information about Polo.com users. 
        Polo.com's Privacy Policy (Privacy Policy) explains the types of information 
        we gather, what we do with it and how you may correct or change information 
        that Polo.com may collect.</p>
      <p><b><u>INFORMATION COLLECTED BY POLO.COM</u></b></p>
      <p>Polo.com collects two types of information about users: personal information 
        (such as name and e-mail address) and aggregate information (such as information 
        about how many users log on to our sites on a daily basis).</p>
      <p><b><u>PERSONAL INFORMATION</u></b></p>
      <p>Personal information is collected when users voluntarily register with 
        Polo.com to purchase items, receive electronic newsletters, use community 
        and communication services, answer surveys and enter contests and other 
        promotional opportunities provided on Polo.com site. We may receive personal 
        usage and demographic information from our affiliates and from third parties, 
        and if you communicate to us by e-mail, we will record the e-mail address 
        from which you send your message. </p>
      <p><b><u>AGGREGATE INFORMATION </u></b></p>
      <p>One method of collecting aggregate information about your activities 
        online (such as the pages you access most frequently or the search terms 
        you enter), and information volunteered by you (such as survey or registration 
        information), is by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address 
        is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you 
        surf the Web. The computers that deliver the Web pages to you automatically 
        identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from 
        our site, our servers log your IP address. </p>
      <p>When you visit this site, we automatically record the name of the domain 
        from which you accessed the site and the type of client computer and type 
        of web browser that you use. If you got to the site by means of a link 
        from another site, our computers will note the fact that you came to us 
        from that linked site. </p>
      <p><b><u>USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED BY POLO.COM</u></b></p>
      <p>The information collected by Polo.com may be used to send you information 
        about our products, services, contests and special promotions being run 
        by Polo.com. We may also use this information to make offers to you and 
        to help us develop and improve Polo.com and tailor our site to your interests. 
      </p>
      <p><b><u>SHARING DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES</u></b></p>
      <p>
Polo.com may share aggregate information with third parties for advertising
and promotional purposes. Polo.com may also share personal information with
consultants and affiliates for internal business purposes and may divulge
personal information if such information is subpoenaed, or if Polo.com
believes that membership has been used to commit unlawful acts, or acts that
may endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public.
We will always request permission to share personal information with our
consultants and affiliates. In addition, Polo.com receives personal usage
and demographic information from its affiliates and from third parties and
uses this information to improve our products and services.
      </p>
      <p><b><u>USE OF COOKIES</u></b></p>
      <p>Polo.com currently does not use "cookies" to record information but intends 
        to use them in the future. A cookie is a small data file that Web sites 
        store on your hard drive when you visit them. Cookies allow us to measure

        your Polo.com experience. Polo.com does not use cookies to retrieve any 
        information from your computer.</p>
      <p>Your web browser should allow you to accept all cookies, reject all cookies

        to accept or reject a cookie generated by a visit to our site. If you 
        prefer, you may set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when 
        cookies are being sent. However, some parts of our site, such as members-only 
        areas (i.e. shopping, contest and game areas) will not function properly 
        if you choose not to accept cookies. If you are concerned that you might 
        have created a cookie in a previous visit, you can view whatever cookies

      <p><b><u>ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS</u></b></p>

        You will only receive a newsletter if you agree to receive it during registration 
        or directly from our newsletter sign-up form.</p>

      <p><b><u>CHILDREN AND PRIVACY</u></b></p>
      <p>Polo.com encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children 
        online, and to be familiar with the sites their children visit. At various 
        places on our site, we may ask the age of our visitors. Polo.com relies 
        on our users to be truthful in responding to these questions. </p>
      <p><b><u>COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC AREAS</u></b></p>
      <p>Information posted to message boards, chat areas, club and home pages 
        is available to the general public. Please use caution when posting any 
        such information. Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful 
        not to provide any personally identifying information while using chat 
        rooms or message boards. Users of chat areas and message boards must follow 
        acceptable standards of behavior when posting messages online. Polo.com 
        reserves the right to, but is not obligated to, refuse or delete any content 
        that in our sole discretion is considered inappropriate. </p>
      <p><b><u>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</u></b></p>
      <p>Polo.com may contain links to sites other than our own. Those sites may 
        not follow the same privacy policies as Polo.com. We have no responsibility 
        for those sites and provide these links solely for the convenience of 
        our visitors. Such links may be to advertisers, content providers or partners 
        who may use our logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. 
        These sites may send their own cookies to you, and may collect information 
        and use it in a way inconsistent with Polo.com's privacy policy. Polo.com 
        does not control the content that appears on these sites and takes no 
        responsibility for their content, nor should it be implied that Polo.com 
        endorses or otherwise recommends such sites or their products or services 
        offered. </p>
      <p><b><u>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</u></b></p>
      <p>No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely 
        secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of 
        Polo.com to intercept or access transmissions or private communications 
        unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, Polo.com 
        cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit 
        to us. Any such transmissions is done at your own risk. </p>
      <p>Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, shall 
        Polo.com be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages 
        that result from the use of the information or materials on Polo.com sites,

        advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
