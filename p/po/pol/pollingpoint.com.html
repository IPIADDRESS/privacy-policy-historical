                      As a website gathers individual pieces of Non-Personal Information 
                      (see definition below) from its users, it may combine similar 
                      data from many or all the users of the website into one 
                      big "batch". For example, the site may add up 
                      the total number of people in Peoria, Illinois, (but not 
                      their names) who are seeking information about weight loss 
                      and compare that to the number of people in Petaluma, California 
                      seeking the same information. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2">This sort of statistical information is 
                      called aggregate data because it reflects the habits and 
                      characteristics of a large group of anonymous people. Websites 
                      may use aggregate data or share it with their business partners 
                      so that the information and services they provide best meet 
                      the needs of the users. Aggregate data also helps advertisers 
                      and sponsors on the Web know how effectively they are reaching 
                      and meeting the needs of their target audience. </font></p>

                      to locate and display web (Internet) pages. The three most 
                      popular browsers are AOL, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and 
                      Netscape Navigator. In addition, most modern browsers can 
                      present multimedia information, including sound and video,

                      takes a "snapshot" of every page you visit and 
                      stores it in the "cache".) The next time you visit 
                      that same page, your download time will be quicker as the

                      tool, or enhancement on a website. Typically, if you "Opt-in" 
                      you must provide certain information, usually Personally 
                      Identifiable Information, to the website or otherwise actively 
                      indicate your choice or preference to participate in the 
                      website program. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2">Opt-Out: Means that if you do not take some 
                      action you are indicating your preference to participate 
                      in a program, email, feature, tool or enhancement on a website. 
                      Typically, if you "Opt-out" you must uncheck a 
                      box next to a stated preference or otherwise take some indicate 
                      action to indicate your preference not to participate in 
                      a program. For example, if you do not wish to receive promotional 
                      emails from <span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">PollingPoint</span> 
                      or its sponsors, you must uncheck the box in your email 
                      preference center that states: "Please send me special 
                      offers and communications from <span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">PollingPoint</span> 
                      and/or its partners that would interest me." </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2">password: A secret series of characters, 
                      typically alphanumeric (meaning it consists of both letters 
                      and numbers) that enables a user to access a file, computer, 
                      or program. The user must enter his or her password before 
                      the computer or system will respond to commands. The password 
                      helps ensure that unauthorized users do not access the system. 
                      In addition, data files and programs may require a password. 
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2">Ideally, the password should be something 
                      that nobody could guess. In practice, many people choose 
                      a password that is easy to remember, such as their name 
                      or their initials. This is one reason it is relatively easy 
                      to break into many computer systems. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2">Personally Identifiable Information (PII) 
                      (also called Personal Information):<a name="def-PII-Person-ident-info"></a> 
                      Information that can be traced back to an individual (contrast 
                      with Non-Personal Information and Aggregate Information). 
                      Examples of PII include your name, home address, telephone 
                      number, email address, and Social Security number. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2">If other pieces of information are linked 
                      to PII, they also become PII. For example, if you use a 
                      nickname to chat online and give out your real name while 
                      chatting, your nickname becomes PII when linked with other 
                      PII.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2">server: A computer that provides services 
                      to other computers. A "web server" stores web 
                      site files and "serves" them to people who request 
                      them. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2">SSL (Secure Sockets Layer): A security protocol 
                      developed by Netscape for transmitting private information 
                      via the Internet. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt 
                      data that's transferred over the SSL connection. Both Microsoft 
                      Internet Explorer (http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/Internet_Explorer.ht 
                      m) and Netscape Navigator (http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/Navigator.htm) 
                      support SSL, and many Web sites use the protocol to obtain 
                      confidential user information, such as credit card numbers. 
                      By convention, URLs that utilize an SSL connection start 
                      with https: instead of http. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2">username: A name used to gain access to 
                      a computer system or program. Usernames, and often passwords, 
                      are required in shared systems, such as the Internet. In 
                      most such systems, users can choose their own usernames 
                      and passwords. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2">Usernames are also required to access some 
                      bulletin board and online services such as <span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">PollingPoint</span>.

                    <p><font size="2">virus: A program or piece of code that is 
                      loaded onto your computer without your knowledge and runs 
                      against your wishes. Viruses can also "replicate" 
                      themselves by copying their code to other computers. All 
                      computer viruses are manmade. A simple virus that can make 
                      a copy of itself over and over again is relatively easy 
                      to produce. Even such a simple virus is dangerous because 
                      it will quickly use all available memory and bring the system 
                      to a halt. An even more dangerous type of virus is one capable 
                      of transmitting itself across networks and bypassing security 
                      systems. There are numerous virus protection programs available.
