This privacy policy sets forth what information we collect about you, how we use your information, and the choices you have about how we use your information.<br>PoliceOne is dedicated to safeguarding your privacy online. As a policy, we will not sell, share or otherwise misuse your customer information. Your customer information helps us customize PoliceOne to your interests and allows us to negotiate valuable member discounts and related services. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings.</p><p>This privacy policy was last updated on 02/14/2008</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.policeone.com&amp;sealid=101"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.policeone.com/policeone/data/images/truste_seal_ctv.gif"></a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td class="blacklink"><p><strong>What personally identifiable information does PoliceOne collect from me?</strong> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="sm"><p>PoliceOne collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites.</p><p>Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, PoliceOne asks all users for your name, email address, city, occupation, industry and personal interests. To confirm the identity of Law Enforcement officials, we also ask for agency information. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to PoliceOne - you will select an appropriate PoliceOne username and then given access to PoliceOne's many offerings.</p><p>In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by PoliceOne and/or our many partners; when you post a PoliceOne Classified ad; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact PoliceOne we may keep a record of that correspondence. PoliceOne also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever PoliceOne collects personal information we include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td class="blacklink"><p><strong>What are cookies and how does PoliceOne use them?</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="sm"><p>As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, PoliceOne uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on PoliceOne where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you accept<br><br>Generally, we use cookies to: </p><ul><li><p>(1) Remind us of whom you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services. The three most common pieces of personal information stored by our cookies are your username, password and security level.&nbsp; This is to verify your permissions to view secure areas of the site and provide a personalized experience upon sign in. Other submitted personal information such as rank and city are not linked to cookies.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing PoliceOne is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.</p></li><li><p>(3) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a PoliceOne-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings.</p></li><li><p>(4) Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of PoliceOne's network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on PoliceOne a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites. </p></li></ul><p>Advertising networks that serve ads onto PoliceOne may also use their own cookies.&nbsp; Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.&nbsp; We have no access to or control over these cookies.&nbsp; This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by PoliceOne.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any of our advertisers.</p><p>PoliceOne also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. In addition, PoliceOne Mail includes IP addresses in outgoing mail message headers.</p><p>Our tracking technology used to for client campaigns throughout the site does not collect any personal identifiable information that you provide as apart of your PoliceOne membership.&nbsp; Your personal information stored in cookies is only used for the purposes listed above to help improve your user experience. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td class="blacklink"><p><strong>How does PoliceOne use my information?</strong> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="sm"><p>PoliceOne's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes personalization services, interactive communications and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, PoliceOne is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.</p><p>In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, PoliceOne plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, active Police Officers). PoliceOne takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. Only PoliceOne has access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through PoliceOne Delivers. You will not receive special offers via email from PoliceOne if you indicate to us that you would not like to receive them. You can change these account preferences at any time.</p><p>PoliceOne does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. PoliceOne may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td class="blacklink"><p><strong>Who is collecting information?</strong> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="sm"><p>When you are on a PoliceOne site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with PoliceOne alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For example, some PoliceOne services, like BLUtube, are offered as a brand of PoliceOne using the same infrastructure and member database.&nbsp; In rare other cases we may offer other co-branded sites the ability to keep areas of their site behind closed doors for users who are NOT verified by our database as an active law enforcement professional.&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to provide this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share your username and security level with our partner company.&nbsp; This information is stored within a cookie during login and not otherwise collected by the partner company for any purpose.&nbsp; If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than PoliceOne, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.&nbsp; If you have any questions about the use of your information by co-branded sites or experience login problems on a co-branded site please email <a href="../Local%20Settings/ROBERT.DIPPELL/Desktop/support@policeone.com">support@policeone.com</a>.</p><p>Promotions that run on PoliceOne may be sponsored by companies other than PoliceOne or may be cosponsored by PoliceOne and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.</p><p>Please be aware that PoliceOne advertisers or web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those web sites linked to PoliceOne are not covered by this privacy statement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td class="blacklink"><p><strong>With whom does PoliceOne share my information?</strong> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="sm"><p>As a general rule, PoliceOne will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.</p><p>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors: PoliceOne may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Details of shared use can be found in specific Terms of Service or Use Agreements, and sweepstakes and promotions rules. Some or all data collected during a PoliceOne promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data.</p><p>Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give PoliceOne permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.</p><p>Merchants listed on PoliceOne have separate privacy and data collection practices. PoliceOne has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies.

All transfer of registration and login information is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). During registration, PoliceOne representatives check the identity of potential Law Enforcement members with the member's department and either mail or call in the member's password to that department or individual. Unfortunately, this process cannot be 100% secure and PoliceOne is not responsible for the misuse of these user names and passwords. Despite all of our precautions, you use PoliceOne at your own risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td class="blacklink"><p><strong>Testimonials </strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="sm"><p>We periodically post member testimonials on PoliceOne which may contain personally identifiable information such as the member’s username.&nbsp; We do obtain the member's consent prior to&nbsp;posting each testimonial.&nbsp; If you have any questions regarding testimonials on PoliceOne or would like a testimonial that includes your personal information removed please <a href="mailto:suport@policeone.com?subject=Remove%20Testimonial">contact us</a>. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td class="blacklink"><p><strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="sm"><p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp; </p><p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.&nbsp; If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p><p>If you ever have questions regarding the PoliceOne privacy policy please email <a href="mailto:support@policecone.com">support@policecone.com</a>.</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><em><br>PoliceOne is a licensee of the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal Program.&nbsp; TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.&nbsp; This privacy statement covers the Web site www.policeone.com.&nbsp; Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</em></p><p><em>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact <a href="mailto:support@policeone.com">support@policeone.com</a>.&nbsp; If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a> TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
