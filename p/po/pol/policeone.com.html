Your customer information helps us customize PoliceOne to your interests and allows us to negotiate valuable member discounts and related services.

<td class="sm">PoliceOne collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites. <br><br>Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, PoliceOne asks all users for your name, email address, address, zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests. To confirm the identity of Law Enforcement officials, we also ask for agency information. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to PoliceOne - you are given a PoliceOne ID and are able to take full advantage of PoliceOne's many offerings. <br><br>In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by PoliceOne and/or our many partners; when you make a purchase through PoliceOne or one of our partners; when you post a PoliceOne Classified ad; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact PoliceOne we may keep a record of that correspondence. PoliceOne also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever PoliceOne collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. </td></tr>

<td class="sm">As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, PoliceOne uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on PoliceOne where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you accept <br><br>Generally, we use cookies to: 
<ul>
<li>(1) Remind us of whom you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services. PoliceOne also uses cookies to store your zip code for other services, such as Yellow Pages. 
</li><li>(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing PoliceOne is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior. 
</li><li>(3) Assist merchants in PoliceOne Stores to track visits to and business at their stores, and to process the items in your shopping basket. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called "click stream" or "click trail" and may also describe which pages you have seen in each merchant's store. 
</li><li>(4) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a PoliceOne-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings. 
</li><li>(5) Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of PoliceOne's network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on PoliceOne a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites. </li></ul>Advertising networks that serve ads onto PoliceOne may also use their own cookies. <br><br>PoliceOne also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.

<td class="blacklink">How does PoliceOne use my information?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="sm">PoliceOne's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, PoliceOne is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you. <br><br>In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, PoliceOne plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). PoliceOne takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. Only PoliceOne has access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through PoliceOne Delivers. You will not receive special offers via email from PoliceOne if you indicate to us that you would not like to receive them. You can change these account preferences at any time. <br><br>PoliceOne does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. PoliceOne may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners. </td></tr>

<td class="sm">When you are on a PoliceOne site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with PoliceOne alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For example, some PoliceOne services, like PoliceOne Event Services, are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner company. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than PoliceOne, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. <br><br>Promotions that run on PoliceOne may be sponsored by companies other than PoliceOne or may be cosponsored by PoliceOne and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared. <br><br>Please be aware that PoliceOne advertisers or web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those web sites linked to PoliceOne are not covered by this privacy statement. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td class="sm">As a general rule, PoliceOne will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed. <br><br>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors: PoliceOne may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Details of shared use can be found in specific Terms of Service or Use Agreements, and sweepstakes and promotions rules. Some or all data collected during a PoliceOne promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. <br><br>Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give PoliceOne permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer. <br><br>PoliceOne Products &amp; Services: If you make a purchase from a store hosted by PoliceOne, or a merchant in PoliceOne, the information obtained during your visit to those stores, and the information you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions to take place. <br><br>Merchants listed in PoliceOne Shopping or site or in PoliceOne Stores have separate privacy and data collection practices. PoliceOne has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding the merchant, their store, and their privacy policies, return to that store's home page and click on their Information link. <br><br>From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt-in to receive information from these third parties, PoliceOne will (with your permission) share your name and email address with them. <br><br>Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate: Under confidentiality agreements, PoliceOne may match user information with third party data. Also, PoliceOne discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 75% of our users are male and are interested in law enforcement) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. <br><br>Other: PoliceOne may also disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) PoliceOne's rights or property, other PoliceOne users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. PoliceOne may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve our products and services. </td></tr>

<td class="sm">PoliceOne may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from PoliceOne and our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only PoliceOne (or agents working on behalf of PoliceOne and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time you can easily edit your PoliceOne Account Information to no longer receive such offers and mailings. You will need your PoliceOne ID and Password in order to access your PoliceOne Account Information. <br><br>On some types of PoliceOne promotions, we will ask for your email address in order to update you on your score, entries, and status in prize drawings. When you participate in these types of promotions, you automatically receive promotion-related email, unless you choose the no-email option that some promotions offer. Occasionally these promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements. <br><br>You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those PoliceOne services that require registration in order to participate. These services include (but are not limited to): PoliceMail, PoliceNetwork, Officer Only Services (Support, Training) and Message Boards. You can still use PoliceOne Investigation Tools, PoliceOne News Service and PoliceOne Directories and Search as well as many other PoliceOne services even if you do not accept cookies. <br><br>PoliceOne does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or not to participate in certain promotions or contests. </td></tr>

If you have forgotten your password, please click here to request a new password. For all other problems signing in to PoliceOne, please click here and complete this form. <br><br>Your PoliceOne account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in not being able to access any members-only area of the PoliceOne network, including your PoliceOne Mail account (if you have one). If you saved the confirmation email you received when you first created your PoliceOne account, you can use the URL provided in that message to delete your account at any time.

<td class="sm">Your PoliceOne Account Information and PoliceOne Profile are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. You may edit your PoliceOne Account Information and PoliceOne Profile by using your PoliceOne ID and password. <br><br>We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. PoliceOne will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your PoliceOne account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. <br><br>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, PoliceOne cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.

<td class="blacklink">What security precautions are in place to protect the identity and security of Law Enforcement officials on PoliceOne?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="sm">PoliceOne has taken several precautions to protect the identity, account names and passwords of officers when they register and log on to PoliceOne.com. All transfer of registration and login information is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). During registration, PoliceOne representatives check the identity of potential Law Enforcement members with the member's department and either mail or call in the member's password to that department or individual. Unfortunately, this process cannot be 100% secure and PoliceOne is not responsible for the misuse of these user names and passwords. Despite all of our precautions, you use PoliceOne at your own risk.</td></tr></tbody></table><br>
