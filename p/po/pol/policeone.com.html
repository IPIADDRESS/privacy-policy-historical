<p align="CENTER"><b><i>PRIVACY STATEMENT</i></b></p></font>
PoliceOne is dedicated to safeguarding your privacy online.  As a policy, we will not sell or otherwise 
misuse your customer information.  Your customer information helps us customize PoliceOne to your interests 
and allows us to negotiate valuable member discounts and related services. Please read the following policy 
to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. 
This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.<br>
<br><font size="2"><b>What personally identifiable information does PoliceOne collect from me?</b></font><br>
<br>PoliceOne collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites.<br>
<br>Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, PoliceOne asks all users 
for your name, email address, address, zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests. To confirm the 
identity of police officers, we also ask …..  of Law Enforcement Officials. The more information you volunteer 
(and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are 
no longer anonymous to PoliceOne - you are given a PoliceOne ID and are able to take full advantage of PoliceOne's 
many offerings.<br></font>

	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" size="1" color="#000080">
	In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited 
	to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by PoliceOne and/or our many partners; when you make 
	a purchase through PoliceOne or one of our partners; when you post a PoliceOne Classified ad; when you submit a listing 
	for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact PoliceOne we may keep a 
	record of that correspondence. PoliceOne also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. 
	Wherever PoliceOne collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.<br>
	<br><font size="2"><b>What are cookies and how does PoliceOne use them?</b></font><br>
	<br>As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, PoliceOne uses cookies to store and 
	sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web 
	server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on PoliceOne where you are prompted to log-in or that 
	are customizable require that you accept<br>
	<br>Generally, we use cookies to:<br>
	<br>(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver 
	to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when 
	you "Sign Out" of our services. PoliceOne also uses cookies to store your zip code for other services, such as Yellow 
	Pages.<br>
	<br>(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing PoliceOne is given a unique cookie which is then used to 
	determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target 
	advertisements based on user interests and behavior.<br>
	<br>(3) Assist merchants in PoliceOne Stores to track visits to and business at their stores, and to process the 
	items in your shopping basket. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click 
	trail" and may also describe which pages you have seen in each merchant's store.<br>
	<br>(4) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a 
	PoliceOne-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress 
	through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings.<br>
	<br>(5) Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of PoliceOne's network of web sites you have visited, and 
	your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or 
	different from one another so that we can make each new experience on PoliceOne a better one. We may use this 
	information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites.<br>
	<br>Advertising networks that serve ads onto PoliceOne may also use their own cookies.<br>
	<br>PoliceOne also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our 
	advertisers. In addition, PoliceOne Mail includes IP addresses in outgoing mail message headers.<br>
	<br><font size="2"><b>How does PoliceOne use my information?</b></font><br>
	<br>PoliceOne's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized 
	experience on our network of sites. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online 
	shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services 
	free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, PoliceOne is able to deliver more relevant 
	advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.<br>
	<br>In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, PoliceOne plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement 
	and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). PoliceOne takes the advertisement 
	and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account 
	information. Only PoliceOne has access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner 
	ads as well as promotional email through PoliceOne Delivers. You will not receive special offers via email from PoliceOne 
	if you indicate to us that you would not like to receive them. You can change these account preferences at any time.<br>
	<br>PoliceOne does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us 
	upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve 
	our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. PoliceOne may share this aggregated data with 
	advertisers or business partners.<br>
	<br><font size="2"><b>Who is collecting information?</b></font><br>
	<br>When you are on a PoliceOne site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with 
	PoliceOne alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For example, some PoliceOne services, like PoliceOne 
	Event Services, are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide this co-branded service to you, 
	it is necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner company. If data is being collected and/or 
	maintained by any company other than PoliceOne, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. 
	If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.<br>
	<br>Promotions that run on PoliceOne may be sponsored by companies other than PoliceOne or may be cosponsored by PoliceOne 
	and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, 
	you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion 
	if you don't want your data to be shared.<br>
	<br>Please be aware that PoliceOne advertisers or web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable 
	information about you. The information practices of those web sites linked to PoliceOne are not covered by this privacy 
	statement.<br>
	<br><font size="2"><b>With whom does PoliceOne share my information?</b></font><br>
	<br>As a general rule, PoliceOne will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your 
	permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the 
	circumstances described below. Please see the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and services 
	for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. The following describes some of the 
	ways that your information may be disclosed.<br>
	<br>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors: PoliceOne may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but 
	this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Details of shared use 
	can be found in specific Terms of Service or Use Agreements, and sweepstakes and promotions rules. Some or all data 
	collected during a PoliceOne promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be 
	shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data.<br>
	<br>Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, 
	you give PoliceOne permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. 
	In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will 
	be notified prior to the transfer.<br>
	<br>PoliceOne Products &amp; Services: If you make a purchase from a store hosted by PoliceOne, or a merchant in PoliceOne, the 
	information obtained during your visit to those stores, and the information you give such as your credit card number and contact 
	information, is provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions to take place.<br>
	<br>Merchants listed in PoliceOne Shopping or site or in PoliceOne Stores have separate privacy and data collection practices. 
	PoliceOne has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding the merchant, their 
	store, and their privacy policies, return to that store's home page and click on their Information link.<br>
	<br>From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you 
	opt-in to receive information from these third parties, PoliceOne will (with your permission) share your name and email address 
	with them.<br>
	<br>Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate: Under confidentiality agreements, PoliceOne may match user information with third 
	party data. Also, PoliceOne discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 75% of our users are male and are interested in 
	law enforcement) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other 
	lawful purposes.<br>
	<br>Other: PoliceOne may also disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this 
	information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference 
	with (either intentionally or unintentionally) PoliceOne's rights or property, other PoliceOne users, or anyone else that could 
	be harmed by such activities. PoliceOne may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and 
	for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve our products and services.<br>
	<br><font size="2"><b>What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?</b></font><br>
	<br>PoliceOne may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services. In addition, if you indicated upon 
	registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from PoliceOne and our partners, we may occasionally send you 
	direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only PoliceOne (or agents working on behalf of 
	PoliceOne and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not 
	object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. 
	Or, at any time you can easily edit your PoliceOne Account Information to no longer receive such offers and mailings. You will 
	need your PoliceOne ID and Password in order to access your PoliceOne Account Information.<br>
	<br>On some types of PoliceOne promotions, we will ask for your email address in order to update you on your score, entries, and 
	status in prize drawings. When you participate in these types of promotions, you automatically receive promotion-related email, 
	unless you choose the no-email option that some promotions offer. Occasionally these promotion-related email messages may include 
	targeted advertisements.<br>
	<br>You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, 
	to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those 
	PoliceOne services that require registration in order to participate. These services include (but are not limited to): PoliceMail, 
	PoliceNetwork, Office Only Services (Support, Training) and Message Boards. You can still use PoliceOne Investigation Tools, 
	PoliceOne News Service and PoliceOne Directories and Search as well as many other PoliceOne services even if you do not accept cookies.<br>
	<br>PoliceOne does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your 
	data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to 
	allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or not to participate in certain promotions or contests.<br>
	<br><font size="2"><b>What is PoliceOne's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable information?</b></font><br>
	<br>You may edit your PoliceOne Account Information and your public PoliceOne Profile at any time by using your PoliceOne ID and password. 
	If you have forgotten your password, please click here to request a new password. For all other problems signing in to PoliceOne, please 
	click here and complete this form.<br>
	<br>Your PoliceOne account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in not being able to access any members-only area of the 
	PoliceOne network, including your PoliceOne Mail account (if you have one). If you saved the confirmation email you received when you 
	first created your PoliceOne account, you can use the URL provided in that message to delete your account at any time. Please contact 
	privacypolicy@PoliceOne.com for further instructions about deleting or deactivating your PoliceOne account.<br>
	<br>If you are participating in a PoliceOne promotion and you wish to update your email address on the promotions mailing list or to 
	quit a promotion and cease receiving promotion-related email, please contact feedback@PoliceOne.com.<br>
	<br>Knowing that you use certain services or features may help us to offer you better and more relevant content and advertisements. 
	But as with all personally identifiable information, we do not make this available to any third parties without your permission. 
	Any user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners regarding financial product or service usage on 
	PoliceOne are provided in the aggregate only and do not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user.<br>
	<br>Please note that there are several places on the PoliceOne network of Web sites where you can transmit credit card information 
	in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit 
	that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.<br>
	<br><font size="2"><b>What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?</b></font><br>
	<br>Your PoliceOne Account Information and PoliceOne Profile are password-protected so that you and only you have access 
	to this personal information. You may edit your PoliceOne Account Information and PoliceOne Profile by using your PoliceOne ID 
	and password.<br>
	<br>We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. PoliceOne will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited 
	phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your PoliceOne account and close your browser window when you 
	have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a 
	computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.<br>
	<br>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to 
	protect your personal information, PoliceOne cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from 
	our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to 
	ensure its security on our systems.<br>
	<br><font size="2"><b>What security precautions are in place to protect the identity and security of Law Enforcement officials on PoliceOne?</b></font><br>
	<br>PoliceOne has taken several precautions to protect the identity, account names and passwords of officers when they register 
	and log on to PoliceOne.com. All transfer of registration and login information is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). 
	During registration, PoliceOne representatives check the identity of potential Law Enforcement members with the member's department 
	and either mail or call in the member's password to that department or individual.  Unfortunately, this process cannot be 100% secure 
	and PoliceOne is not responsible for the misuse of these user names and passwords. Despite all of our precautions, you use PoliceOne 
	at your own risk.<br><br>
