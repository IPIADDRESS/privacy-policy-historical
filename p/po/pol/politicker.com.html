					<h1>Observer Media Group Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated: March 15, 2011</p>
<p>At&nbsp;<em>The New York Observer</em>, we understand that privacy is important, and we’ve created this policy to give you information about how we collect and use personal information. Our policy is divided into two sections: Section 1 describes how we collect and use data from users of Observer Media Group Web sites. Section 2 describes how we collect and use data from subscribers to the print and electronic editions of&nbsp;<em>The New York Observer</em> newspaper. We also encourage you to review our Terms of Service for information regarding rights, usage, trademarks, licenses, liability, trademark, and content ownership.</p>
<p>We reevaluate this policy on an ongoing basis, and we value your feedback. If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, we ask that you contact us at:</p>
<p><strong>Customer Service</strong><br>
<em>The New York Observer, LLC</em><br>
321 W. 44th St., 6th Floor<br>
New York, New York 10036<br>
(212) 755-2400<br>
<a href="mailto:customerservice@observer.com">Email</a></p>
<p>Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We will post the new policy on this page, and, if the changes allow us to use personally identifying information in ways that are different from the ways specified at the time the information was originally collected, our Web site will contain a special notice about the changes. Each version of this privacy policy will be identified by its effective date, which you can find at the bottom of the page.</p>
<h2><em>The New York Observer</em> Online Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><em>The New York Observer</em> collects data, including personally identifying information, from people who use Observer Media Group web sites. This section of our privacy policy explains how we collect and use this data. Please note that&nbsp;<em>The New York Observer</em> subscriber data is maintained separately from data gathered from our online users. This means that users of Observer Media Group web sites who also subscribe to the New York Observer newspaper, in either print or electronic form, should read both this section and Section 2 (<em>The New York Observer</em> Subscriber Privacy Policy) in order to have a full understanding of our privacy practices.</p>
<h2>Information we collect and how we use it</h2>
<p>When you visit Observer Media Group web sites,&nbsp;<em>The New York Observer</em> collects several forms of usage data, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log data. Our servers automatically record certain information sent by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.</li>
<li>Cookie data. When you visit Observer Media Group web sites,&nbsp;<em>The New York Observer</em> or one of our affiliates or third-party partners may send one or more “cookies”–small files containing a string of characters–to your computer to identify you as a unique user. If you have registered with&nbsp;<em>The New York Observer</em>, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to customize portions of the site. If you haven’t registered, the cookie identifies you as a unique user and helps ensure a smoother experience on the site, such as by limiting the number of times that you see certain subscription offers. If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.</li>
<li>Traffic and advertising data. Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable&nbsp;<em>The New York Observer</em> to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented. These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites you have visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you visit Observer Media Group web sites.</li>
<li>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies while you surf our site. Or you can use third-party anonymizer services to mask information in your cookies or even general data such as your IP address. In such cases you would not be able to take advantage of most of the personalization services offered on Observer Media Group web sites.</p>
<p>The aggregated information we collect is used for a number of purposes including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>To improve the content and design of Observer Media Group web sites.</li>

<li>If you have previously registered with another New York Observer affiliate and you begin to fill out certain forms on Observer Media Group web sites, the site may recognize you and automatically complete the form, and this auto-fill data will then be included in your Observer Media Group web site user record.</li>
<li>If you have provided information to Observer Media Group web sites<em> </em>, from time to time we may enhance that information with other information that we collect from third-party sources.</li>
</ul>
