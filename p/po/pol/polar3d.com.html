<h2><strong>POLAR3D PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h2>
<p class="alert_message_text"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last updated August 1, 2019</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polar3D, LLC ("Polar3D") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to those who visit the websites ("Sites") owned and operated by Polar3D and located at polar3d.com and about.polar3d.com. This Privacy Policy describes how Polar3D collects, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information. The use of information collected through our Sites shall be limited to the purpose of providing, supporting, and improving the services offered by the Sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at support@polar3d.com.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Privacy Compliance</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With respect to personal data received or transferred, Polar3D is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Polar3D may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polar3D complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. Polar3D has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. &nbsp;To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit </span><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Your Privacy Choices &amp; Means</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your personal information is kept strictly confidential and will not be shared or sold to third parties except as necessary to deliver our services. In the event Polar3D will need to share information outside of our normal services, we will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their Personal Information is (a) to be disclosed to a third party acting as a controller, or (b) to be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For sensitive personal information, Polar3D will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly consent (opt-in) to the disclosure of their Sensitive Personal Information to (a) a third party acting as a controller or (b) the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Polar3D will provide individuals with reasonable (especially clear and conspicuous, readily available) mechanisms to exercise their choices and includes, without limitation, the ability to delete their account and all Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information associated therewith, if any. See below and  </span><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=Privacy-Policy-FAQs-1-5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Policy FAQs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for additional information.</span></p><p></p>

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unique Identifiers, such as your email address.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may collect the following personal information from our Single Sign-On providers when you use our Sites:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your email address, first name, and last name;</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your preferred public display name;</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your profile image.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information collected from our Single Sign-On providers is saved in your Account profile within Polar3D's databases. At any time you can change or remove the above information via your </span><a href="https://polar3d.com/member-settings"><span style="font-weight: 400;">account settings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the Sites.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Use</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use the personal information collected from within the Sites or when you use the Sites to:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide you with the services of the Sites</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send you communication from the Sites</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send you requested product or service information</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respond to customer service requests</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Administer your account</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send you promotional and marketing communications</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respond to your questions and concerns</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitate your transactions with other users when you use our Sites</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the information collected from the Single Sign-On providers, only your profile image and display name are disclosed to other members of the Sites. (Please note, in some instances the Single Sign-On providers may provide a display name constructed from your first and last names or even use your email address. Change your display name via the </span><a href="https://polar3d.com/member-settings"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account settings page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to suit your preferences.) Should you use devices (e.g., 3D printers) of other members through the Sites, your email address will be disclosed to the managers of those devices. That so that they may contact you should the need arise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Google's Single Sign-On, the Sites also ask your consent to access (read-only) your Google Classrooms and Google Drive, should you use either. This is done to assist you with the creation of classroom groups within the Sites, and to allow you to access 3D models you might have stored in Google Drive. Classroom data is restricted to the names of the classrooms and the students enrolled. When you choose to create a classroom group within the Sites, you have the option of drawing information from your active and provisioned Google Classrooms. The only retained Google Classroom data is the unique Google Classroom identifier associated with a given Google Classroom. Any 3D model you choose to access from Google Drive is copied to the Sites, instantiating a copy of the file data which is then accessible to only your Account at the Sites. You may subsequently choose to share that file copy with other members of the Sites; however, without your explicit action, the copy is kept private to your own Account.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Share</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except as outlined in this Policy, your information will never be sold to or shared with other companies or organizations for commercial purposes or otherwise. We may transfer personal information to our sub-contractors that help us provide our Sites. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our sub-contractors. Such sub-contractors may include third-party payment processors who process your credit card and other payment information for Polar3D but are otherwise not permitted to store, retain or use such information. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are committed to the responsible onward transfer of data to third parties, and work to ensure that our sub-contractors provide the same level of protection as is required under the Privacy Shield Principles. We will remain liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if a sub-contractor that we engage to process personal information on our behalf does so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to damage. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Correction or Removal of Personal Information</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, you can correct or remove your personal information via your </span><a href="https://polar3d.com/member-settings"><span style="font-weight: 400;">account settings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page within the Sites.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Other Information</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other information such as End-Customer device models (e.g., 3D printers), IP address, or usage patterns are also captured by the Sites.

<h3><strong>Protection of Information</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sites have industry standard security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. When you provide us with sensitive information (such as credit card information or login credentials), we will encrypt that information via Secure Socket Layer (SSL).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet, we take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of your personal information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Sites and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we receive your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</span></p>
