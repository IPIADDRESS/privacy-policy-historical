<p><strong>Collection and Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal information is information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify you.&nbsp; Personal information also includes anonymous information that is linked to information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify you. &nbsp;Personal information does not include information that has been irreversibly anonymized or aggregated so that it can no longer enable us, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
