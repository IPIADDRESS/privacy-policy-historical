<p>Information from Email Communications: We may use a third party vendor to conduct email marketing. We (or our third party vendor) may track whether or not you open our emails so that we can tailor our emails for what interests you. We (or our third party vendor) also use your email information to determine whether we already send you messages so that we do not send you multiple emails.

<p>Third Party Information: We sometimes obtain information about you from other sources to supplement the information provided by you. For example, we receive updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your future purchases; account information, purchase and redemption information, and information about your interaction from some merchants with which we partner or for which we provide other services; and credit history and information from credit reporting firms, which we use to help prevent fraud and to assist us evaluating our customers. In addition, when you link your Polaroid.com account to other social networks, we store authentication tokens for each social network that you link to Polaroid.com.

<p>Sharing with Polaroid Companies: Over time, Polaroid may grow and evolve. We may share your information, including personal information, with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work with affiliated businesses, generally licensees of the Polaroid brand. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. We may share your information, including personal information, with these third parties, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Third-Party Service Providers: We work with other companies and individuals to perform business functions on our behalf. These third parties may have access to personal information needed to perform these functions, but generally are not authorized to use it for purposes beyond their engagement or transmit it beyond their usage.</p>
<p>Promotions: From time to time we may send offers for products and services that may be of interest to selected groups of Polaroid.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we generally do not give that business your personal information.&nbsp; However, in some circumstances we may do so. If you do not want to receive these types of offers from Polaroid.com, please adjust your preferences in your account.</p>
<p>Mergers or Business Transactions: As we continue to evolve our business, we might enter into agreements to buy or sell businesses or assets, including customer information. If customer information is sold, it remains subject to the promises made in the applicable Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). It is also possible that Polaroid.com could be acquired along with its customer information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal Protection: It may become necessary for us to release account and other personal information if we believe the release is necessary or required for us to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (ii) enforce our Terms and Conditions or other policies or agreements; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (iv) protect the rights, property or safety of Polaroid.com, our owners, service providers, licensees, users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p>Upon Your Consent: Unless otherwise shared in a manner provided above in this Privacy Policy, you will receive notice before personal information is shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share your personal information for such purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Third Parties Links and Advertisements</strong></p>
<p>Polaroid.com may have third-party advertising and links to other websites or services. Any personal information you provide on third-party websites or services or through third-party ads is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's policies governing privacy and security. You should be aware that some of these third party websites and advertisers (or services working at their request) may use technology that sends the advertisements to your browser, and as a result they receive your internet address when this happens. In addition, they may use cookies, tags, beacons, JavaScript or other technologies to measure the performance of advertisements to customize the advertisements. Polaroid.com does not have the right to access or control such practices and such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party websites, ads or services. We recommend that you contact these third party websites and advertisers directly if you would like more information about their privacy practices. If you prefer that we do not use your personal information to allow third parties to personalize advertisements for you, please adjust your preferences in your account.<br> <br> <br> <strong>How secure is my information?</strong><br> To prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or improper use of your personal information, we have established reasonable physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect the personal information we collect. For example,<strong>&nbsp; </strong>all order related personally identifiable information is stored in secure facilities adhering to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCIDSS). Your order and purchase information is protected during its transmission by use of industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, which encrypts your information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our order confirmation system will only reveal the last four digits of your credit card number and expiration date. However, we must transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</p>
<p>Although we take reasonable steps to safeguard personal information, no practices are 100% immune, and we can't guarantee the security of information. Outages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. You must protect against unauthorized access to your account, password, computer and other important information. We strongly recommend that you log off each time you finish using a shared computer.<br> <br> <br> <strong>How do I access my information?</strong><br> Polaroid.com allows you the right to view certain information about your account and your interactions with Polaroid.com, and you are allowed to update certain information from time to time.
