          <h1>Poll Everywhere Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>
            By using the polleverywhere.com web site (“Service”), a service of Condense, Inc. (“Condense”), you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions (“Privacy Policy”).
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We transfer information about you if Condense or Poll Everywhere is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Condense will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
          </p>

          </p>
          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>
