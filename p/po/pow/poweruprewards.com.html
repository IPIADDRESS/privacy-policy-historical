                PowerUpRewards.com is aware of your concerns about use of your personal information. We
                attempt to use and share personal information that we collect online carefully and
                sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting PowerUpRewards.com, you
                are accepting the practices described in this privacy notice.</p>
            <p>
                Our online privacy policy applies only to information that we collect from customers
                online who visit PowerUpRewards.com; it does not apply to any information collected at
                our retail stores and outlets. This website contains links to other websites. PowerUpRewards.com
                is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites.</p>
            <p>
                In this document, the word "computer" means any device used to connect to PowerUpRewards.com,
                including, but not limited to, mobile devices.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>We Gather the Following Personal Information About Customers:</strong></p>
            <p>
                <strong>Information That You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any information
                you enter on our website or that you give us in any other way. You can choose not
                to provide certain information, but this will limit your ability to purchase products
                offered on the website, or to take advantage of some of our features for website
                customers.</p>
            <p>
                When you place an order with us, your contact information is used to communicate
                related information, such as order and shipment confirmation, release date changes
                and requests for more information to facilitate the processing of your order. You
                may opt-out of these communications by canceling your order.</p>
            <p>
                We use customer contact information from the account form to customize future shopping
                for you, to improve our website and stores, and, if you choose, to send you information
                about our company and to inform you of sales and special offers. If, after receiving
                a non-order related email, you do not want to receive such emails in the future,
                you can notify us, by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link attached to each email.</p>
            <p>
                We obtain information about you when you search, buy, participate in a contest or
                questionnaire, communicate with customer service, or otherwise contact us or post
                information on the website. For example, you provide information when you search
                for a product; place an order through PowerUpRewards.com or provide information to update
                or create your account with us (you may have more than one account if you have used
                more than one email address when shopping with us); communicate with us by phone,
                email, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; create any
                wish or gift list; participate in any forums or discussion areas or product reviews;
                or create any alerts or other email notification services we may offer now or in
                the future. The information collected typically includes your name, address, and
                phone numbers; credit card information; people to whom purchases have been shipped,
                including addresses and phone numbers; content of reviews you may provide; emails
                to us; and any other personal information that you provide to us or post on the
                website.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>We occasionally run our own email surveys</strong> and we ask visitors for
                contact, demographic and technical information. We use contact data from our surveys
                to send users information about our company. This information is also used to contact
                visitors to learn more about specific problems they might have reported or to give
                them rewards, if such a reward program is part of the survey. The demographic information
                is used to learn more about the types of people who visit our site.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information</strong>
                (such as their email address). We use this information to contact the winners. We
                may share contest information entered on our website with our business and marketing
                partners.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>We allow customers to post reviews</strong> and to allow visitors to communicate
                information on products. When posting a review, you can optionally display your
                name, an alias, or remain anonymous. However, if you disclose personally identifiable
                information in your review, that information is public information and may increase
                your chance of receiving unsolicited email. You should use discretion when disclosing
                information online.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Automatic Collection of Information:</strong> If you purchase any products
                online, or have any other interaction with our website, we will receive and store
                information that you provide or that is generated by your actions. For example,
                like many websites, we use "cookies," which are placed on your computer (explained
                in more detail below), to remember your name and the contents of your shopping cart.
                This allows you to leave our site, come back later, and still have the contents
                of your shopping cart intact. It also lets us personalize your experience at PowerUpRewards.com,
                tailoring the content to your interests. A number of companies offer utilities designed
                to help you visit websites anonymously, but if you use these utilities, it may limit
                your ability to use personalized features that we offer.</p>
            <p>
                The information we receive or can determine from your interaction with our website
                includes your Internet (IP) address; login and password information; email address;
                web browser type and version; operating system and computer platform; purchase history,
                which we may aggregate with similar information from other customers; the full Uniform
                Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our website, including
                date and time; cookie number; products you viewed or searched for; areas of our
                website you visited; and the phone number you used to call our toll-free number.
                We also may log the length of time of your visit and the number of times you visit
                and purchase from us. We assign you a unique internal identifier to help keep track
                of your future visits.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>email Communications:</strong> We provide email links on our "Customer
                Services" page that allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments
                you may have. We may receive a confirmation when you open any email that we send
                to you, if your computer supports such capabilities. If you send us any email, we
                will retain such email and your email address for response. We also may compare
                our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid
                sending unnecessary or duplicate messages to you.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong> If we receive any information about
                you from other sources, we may add it to our account information. For example, if
                we receive a list of subscribers to a gaming publication, and we note that you are
                a subscriber, we may include that information in the account information that we
                store about you. Other examples of information we receive from other sources include
                updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other third parties,
                which we use to correct our records; account information, purchase or redemption
                information, and page-view information from business partners who operate their
                own websites or for which we provide any services; search term and search result
                information from searches conducted through the website; and credit history information
                from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>An Explanation of "Cookies"</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are placed by us on your computer's storage
                system through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser
                when you make future visits to our website, and to store certain information (such
                as items placed in your shopping cart) between visits.</p>
            <p>
                You can stop your computer from storing cookies if you want. Most browsers will
                tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the
                browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
                You should look in the "Help" area shown on your browser's toolbar. Because cookies
                allow you to have the benefit of our personalized features, we recommend that you
                leave them turned on. You MUST have cookies enabled in order to checkout on our
                website.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sharing of Information</strong></p>
            <p>
                <strong>Tournaments:</strong> If you register for tournaments on PowerUpRewards.com, we
                may share your registration data with the tournament host and they may use it for
                internal tracking and analytics. For instance, if you give us your Xbox Live Gamertag
                for a Microsoft tournament, Microsoft will use that information for internal research.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sharing with Third Parties.</strong> We may share customer information that
                we collect with third parties. Usually, this information will be shared with a third
                party that has relationship with us as a business partner or marketing partner.
                (See information on Third Party Relationships below.) Also, we may use the information
                that you provide us, or that we collect about you, in connection with the promotion
                of our products and services and those of our affiliates. It is not our policy to
                sell or rent lists of our website customers to unaffiliated third parties.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sharing with our Contractors.</strong> We also may employ other companies
                and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include: order fulfillment,
                package delivery, postal mail and email communications, customer lists management,
                data analysis, marketing assistance, credit card processing, and customer relationship
                management. These companies and individuals have access to personal information
                needed to perform their functions, but they are not permitted to use such information
                for other purposes without our permission.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Promotional Offers May be Sent to You.</strong> We may send you offers on
                behalf of our company or other businesses, or permit other businesses that we are
                working with to send you offers, if we believe that you may be interested in receiving
                these offers. If, after receiving a non-order related email, you do not want to
                receive such emails in the future, you can notify us, by clicking on the "unsubscribe"
                link attached to each email.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sale or Acquisition of Business Units.</strong> As we continue to develop
                our business, we may buy or sell business divisions or companies, we may merge or
                combine with another company, or our company itself, or all or a significant part
                of its assets, may be acquired by another company. In such transactions, customer
                information generally is one of the transferred and shared business assets. The
                information transferred and shared remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing
                privacy notice (unless, of course, the customer has agreed to be subject to new
                privacy notice terms).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Legal Requirements and Protection of PowerUpRewards.com and Others.</strong> We
                may decide to release your account and other personal information if we believe
                release is appropriate or necessary to comply with the law, to enforce or apply
                our website terms of use and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property,
                or safety of PowerUpRewards.com, our users, or others. This information may be released
                or exchanged with other companies and organizations to protect against fraud, or
                for credit risk reduction. We will cooperate with law enforcement and judicial authorities,
                and we may provide personally identifiable information to appropriate government
                authorities upon receipt of a subpoena or court order, or to cooperate with a law
                enforcement investigation. We will fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies
                in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We also reserve
                the right to report to law enforcement agencies activities that we in good faith
                believe to be illegal. We undertake no obligation or duty to release such information,
                however, unless we are required to do so under applicable law.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Other Circumstances.</strong> If we want to share personal information other
                than as permitted or described above, we will notify you, and you may choose to
                instruct us not to share the information.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Third Party Relationships</strong></p>
            <p>
                <strong>We have several types of third-party relationships.</strong></p>
            <ul class="showDisc">
                <li>We offer an affiliate program through a third-party affiliate manager. This program
                    allows other websites to earn money by directing people (through links) to our website.
                    If you sign up as an affiliate, your contact information (website address and related
                    information, email address, mailing and payment addresses, and contact information)
                    is sent to the third-party affiliate manager who activates your affiliate status
                    and pays you based on the sales you generate for PowerUpRewards.com. You may apply for
                    this program using an Affiliate Program application. The Affiliate Program area
                    is clearly labeled, and your information is never collected or shared unless you
                    also fill out an Affiliate Program application. </li>
                <li>We work with business partners to provide you access to their products and services.
                    For example, our website includes a link to www.alienware.com. Any information you
                    supply upon entering the www.alienware.com site is collected by Alienware. </li>
                <li>We link to third-party surveys. When you complete a purchase, you are often invited
                    to participate in a survey to rate your experience. The survey is conducted by a
                    third party (and is identified as such) who shares all of the survey information
                    with us, including your email address if you specify it in the survey. We use this
