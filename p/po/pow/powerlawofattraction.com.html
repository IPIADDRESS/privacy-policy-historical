<p><strong>The privacy of our site visitors&nbsp;is important to us!</strong></p>
<p>We recognize that&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;and protection of your personal information is important.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>“Here is useful and important information&nbsp;about our&nbsp;privacy policy; and&nbsp;information about what types of private personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit&nbsp;www.<em><em><strong>PowerLawofAttraction</strong></em></em>.com,&nbsp;our&nbsp;site privacy policy&nbsp;both has and shows you valuable information&nbsp;on&nbsp;how we actively safeguard&nbsp;and strongly protect your&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;and personal information.” &nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We never sell your private personal information to third parties</span>.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Log Files</strong><br>
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files.&nbsp; The information in the log files include&nbsp; your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL, Verizon Internet, or Comcast Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer, Opera, Google Chrome&nbsp;or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong><br>
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site.&nbsp; This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features.</p>
<p>We also use third party advertisements on&nbsp;www.<em><em><strong>PowerLawofAttraction</strong></em></em>.com&nbsp;to support our site.&nbsp; Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.&nbsp; This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>
<p><strong>DoubleClick DART cookies</strong><br>
We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements).&nbsp; This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”).&nbsp; The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey).&nbsp; DART uses “non personally identifiable information”.&nbsp; It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.</p>
<p><strong>You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting<a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx"><span style="color: #009fe1;">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Norton Internet Security</span>,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">McAfee Software Suite</span>, or any version of&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">AVG Anti-Virus Software</span>.&nbsp; However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.&nbsp; This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em><em><strong>PowerLawofAttraction</strong></em></em>&nbsp;or accounts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program.&nbsp; Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.</strong></p>

I had been madly in love with a man in the military for a year and it came to heartbreaking end in July, literally a few days after our one year anniversary. Alot of reasons came in to play about why we broke up: his friends hated me because he gave me all his attention, one of his exes caused issues, I was insecure and unhappy with myself, and finally we were just downright toxic for eachother. When we broke up I had never felt such pain before, like someone ripped my fucking heart out of my chest. Of course, being madly in love and desperate, I did all the bad things you shouldn't do. I begged, called alot and just couldn't walk away without a fight. That just pushed him away even more, plus time was running out because he was being deployed to Jordan for 6 months and I wanted to get back together before he left. I made a vision board, visualized us together, and wrote like crazy in my journal about us being together. I tried to believe he would eventually pick up the phone and call me and ask for me back and y'know the typical ex back fantasy. Well, two months later nothing happened and so I decided to reach out to him myself. After endless nights of pain and tears and fantasies, I messaged him. He was rude and didn't want anything to do with me. Then something snapped in me, wtf am I doing?? I got&nbsp; angry and cussed him out and blocked him out completely. I refuse to lower myself for someone who will treat me like shit.&nbsp; The next day I threw everything he gave me away. I didn't cry or fuss, I hardened my heart to move on. A few weeks went by and I decided I wanted to a new love. I learned about making a Soulmate List and decided to have fun with it. I would read it every night and day, my heart swelled at the thought of this awesome dude sliding into my life. There was just one problem....I couldn't stop dreaming of my ex every single night. It was annoying and always felt like a anchor in my head. Every time I read my list before bed, I would have vivid dreams of my ex and wake up with the echoes of his words. It drove me insane, sometimes I didn't want to sleep. I felt like I was being haunted by him and that scared the shit out of me. The dreams were always so real and strange. He would apologize in my dream and ask for me back. Same thing every night. I couldn't understand why my dream guy wouldn't show up in dreams yet my ex would invade. Then, one night, I was fed up and pissed and decided to pray to God. I basically asked him what was I doing wrong and how come my dream guy isn't showing up and can you atleast show him in my dreams? That night I had the most powerfully vivid dream of my ex. When I woke up I was so mad and said some blasphemous things about God..yeah I know bad. Then a few hours later guess who called my unhappy ass? My ex. He said every single thing he told me in my dreams and admitted to thinking about me strongly all day every day.

For the last few years I've been stalked by the number 11, 111, 1111 and 333. Sometimes it would slow down but I've seen those numbers pretty consistently. Last week I watched a Dolores Cannon video where she said we should speak to our guardian angels and spirit guide and ask them for help. They want to assist us and want us to ask for help. I started saying good morning and good night to my guardian angel (s) and spirit guide and asked them for help. Over the last three or four days the number sequences have been crazy. I can't read anything without seeing those numbers. I watch a lot of Youtube and if I skip ahead in a video I always seem to land on the 1:11 mark. I'll look at the end time of a video and it will end in 11 seconds. I look at the clock at it will be 11 minutes after the hour etc. It's been crazy and now I check the forum and see you've made this thread. I'm not exactly sure how angels tie into LOA but my understanding is they help to manifest your desires quickly and give you signs to show that you're on the right path. I personally believe this as I've been seeing these numbers so much since I've started speaking with them. I think they're trying to communicate with us and help us to manifest.">Re: Angels and LoA - does that fit together?</a> <span class="rss-date">November 26, 2015</span></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.powerlawofattraction.com/forum/index.php?topic=22282.msg189760#msg189760" title="Hey guys,first i want to say that i never was in religion or stuff like that. my whole life, i was open to things i could not see, but also sceptic. i'm still having trouble to believe that LoA works although it worked for me many times. but i didn't understand how someone can believe in angels...until 2 weeks ago:on november the first, i started seeing double or triple numbers, mostly 33(3), everywhere. one day, i came in my room and sensed a positive presence really strongly. i meditated and asked who that presence was. first i only got pictures. i was curious about that, so i tried the spirit guide meditation from Teal Swan. there it was -&nbsp; an angel (without wings) who introduced himself as Raphael. in my visualization he gave me a strange object, i couldn't really identify. i just knew that it was made of glass and hollow. i wasn't into angels, so i looked Raphael up and was surprised that he is often shown with a vial. i was surprised because what he gave me looked really similar. it was impossible for my brain to making this up, because i knew nothing about the symbol of Raphael. so i started to open up to the thought that angels maybe do exist. maybe one thing to my current situation: i live together with bei (ex)bf and sometimes it's really hard for me. i KNOW that we will be together, but i don't like the part that it's not happening NOW. So sometimes i'm very low. sometimes when i sat on my bad crying, there was a vioce in my head &quot;don't worry&quot;. it shifted my energy and comforted me.yesterday, i felt terrible. i just felt like crying and left university earlier because..i just wanted to cry. a week earlier, i asked the universe for a license plate with the initials of my bf and me, but it didn't show up...until yesterday. i sat in the earlier bus i normally never take and looked for the plate. i thought: &quot; it will never show up if you desperatly looking for it&quot;...and there ist was: &quot;SF111&quot;. i didn't ask for 111, but if it weren't there, i had label it as mere coincidence. when i came home, i cried and cried. i just wanted to give up. i thought of talking to my bf still this very day about moving out and giving completely up on him. in this moment, a thought popped up in my head that wasn't mine: &quot;why are you worrying?&quot;. i'm absolutely sure that this thought didn't came from my brain. i felt release, i felt there is someone who know that we are meant to be together - but that bumps into my LoA belief system.after that, i asked when we will be back together and the immediate answer was: &quot;in 3 weeks&quot;. i looked the date up and it is 16th of december - one day before my birthday and the day we came together. i'm confused. i don't think that i &quot;created&quot; that information by myself. but how does it work together with LoA? can angels help us manifesting? did they help us to fullfill our soul contract? are to people meant to be together or is it just wishfull thinking? i really would like to move on, but something deep inside me says &quot;...">Angels and LoA - does that fit together?</a> <span class="rss-date">November 26, 2015</span></li></ul></aside><aside id="rss-3" class="widget widget_rss"><h1 class="widget-title"><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.powerlawofattraction.com/forum/6/?action=.xml;type=rss" title="Syndicate this content"><img style="border:0" width="14" height="14" src="http://www.powerlawofattraction.com/wp-includes/images/rss.png" alt="RSS"></a> <a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.powerlawofattraction.com/forum/index.php" title="Live information from Law of Attraction Forum">Discussion: Law of Attraction &amp; Relationship, Ex back, Soulmate</a></h1><ul><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.powerlawofattraction.com/forum/index.php?topic=20213.msg189729#msg189729" title="">Re: Useful quotes for ex-back</a> <span class="rss-date">November 25, 2015</span></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.powerlawofattraction.com/forum/index.php?topic=21749.msg189655#msg189655" title="Does having a dream having intimate intercourse with them a sign that you are manifesting bringing a significant specific other back?">Re: Signs that have lead to manifestation..</a> <span class="rss-date">November 21, 2015</span></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.powerlawofattraction.com/forum/index.php?topic=22264.msg189651#msg189651" title="I must say I share alot of the points Yesican spoke about however, isn't&nbsp; LOA about focusing intensions anD desires on what you truly want. You may want the specific person but what you really want is love, commitment, fulfillment, etc and trusting that the laws of the Universe will grant you your desires with the specific person that is matched up or in alignment.So saying that men are this and there are these specific rules to win his heart may not be much of an advantage. I believe when you focus on lack you attract like. And you can have whatever you want as long as you believe you already have it. I have seen and personally attested to relationship being totally transformed where there was once no indication of hope or anything positive. I know RS may be targeted to someone specific but when you really do all the techniques you really realize it's designed for you to feel better and thus projecting an image of more love to everyone around you. In my experience with it, I have been gaining more attention from people who are aligned with my emotions and I'm too focused on the specific target to be interested in others.Ka-Jo I believe you can have whatever you want as long as deep down it is what you want. But usually deep down we realize we want something more than what that specific person can give us. That's why its good to go general in some cases and focus on attracting more love, more romance, more relationships etc.">Re: Remote Seduction works but not getting quite the results I want</a> <span class="rss-date">November 21, 2015</span></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.powerlawofattraction.com/forum/index.php?topic=22264.msg189650#msg189650" title="&nbsp;Just forget about the RS for a minute an ask yourself this question, are you wanting to use RS or loa on this guy because, you truly think he is the one for you and you feel like he can give you everything that you need and want and more? Or are you simply using it because you feel like you won't get better than this guy and are acting out of fear? The reason I ask this is , you say you went on a bad date with this guy, ok not to judge, I think everyone deserves second chances and I'm not quite sure what went on. You then say that in the mean time he's had a relationship which was really hard for you. Also you say you think you can bring a lot to his life. It sounds a lot like your thinking about all of his needs rather than your own, and I feel like your too attached to this guy already. In my opinion what I think you should do is wait, and try figure out if you really really want this guy or see if you can attract someone even better. Think about yourself for a change, your needs and wants.Would you still play along even if he still sticks with his decision to not have a relationship? Let me tell you this, why would a young attractive independent woman want to spend her time hanging out with a guy who doesn't want a relationship when she does? Just think about that. If you decide that you really do want to attract this guy then I think you should stopWith the RS, and just to do nightly visualizations. What do you want with this guy? Commitment right? So imagine it, imagine being with him in a relationship. Feel the feelings of having a relationship now, but really feel these feelings. After time you will either start believing it or decide to stop with the visualizations. Then, let go! What I mean by that is focus on you., other areas of your life. Go have fun and live life knowing that it's not the end of the world if this guy doesn't come back, you need to be ok with that. The way I see it in attracting a specific person is that if your vibrating the frequency of love then it has to happen, I'm not saying with him, it might be, it might not be but who ever it is you will be happy that it's that person.. Good luck.">Re: Remote Seduction works but not getting quite the results I want</a> <span class="rss-date">November 21, 2015</span></li></ul></aside><aside id="rss-5" class="widget widget_rss"><h1 class="widget-title"><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.powerlawofattraction.com/forum/5/?action=.xml;type=rss" title="Syndicate this content"><img style="border:0" width="14" height="14" src="http://www.powerlawofattraction.com/wp-includes/images/rss.png" alt="RSS"></a> <a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.powerlawofattraction.com/forum/index.php" title="Live information from Law of Attraction Forum">Discussion: Law of Attraction &amp; Wealth, Financial Freedom</a></h1><ul><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.powerlawofattraction.com/forum/index.php?topic=22131.msg189734#msg189734" title="Thanks so much for the replies!

All that you have created in front of you is from past thought. Therefore, if you want to see some changes you must be persistent in your new and abundant ways of thinking. Only then will your mind start to transform your external reality. The key is to reclaim your birth rite which is TRUE abundance. The creator did not create lack, we did! Therefore, choose to uncreate lack by refusing to see it! Choose to see in your minds eye what you truly desire, as you can not imagine anything that doesn’t already exist! (otherwise you couldn’t even imagine it!). Everything we desire already exists because there is no time and space. Anything that could have happened, has already happened. That is where there is infinite possibilities available to us at all times. We choose have to choose the frequency that we desire and pull that already created reality into our current reality. It really is simple, we just let our emotions and frustrations over complicate things sometimes. Command what you want and become the kind of person who is already living this lifestyle. Someone at such a high caliber of wealth wouldn’t stress over a little money borrowed from a friend. They would feel good helping others and trust that it will come back tenfold to them!

But law of attraction, was one of the concepts which automatically pulled me, into it.

On applying it, i realized, among all the self improvement concepts, thoughts play a major role.
First worked on my thought process and then tried it, first in getting that <b>Dream job</b> I always desire one with great package and very near to my home. After applying the law started getting calls from MNC’s which were very near to my place, Lately wanted to badly invest in  a short term investment, because of the economic slack no companies promised more than 7% rate of interest,
 just two days back my aunt calls up telling me about this short term plan with 8.5% rate of interest. I thanked the universe for this amazing investment plan. With total faith now I attract everything I desire for. 

And the most important of all desire wanted to help people in the best possible way since and I found the way, being a moderator on this site of law of attraction was itself a great blessing and the best way to help people around the world.
