            <li>confirming your identity;</li>

            <li>we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law;</li>
            <li>we want to carry out a credit check to consider your credit worthiness. See our <a href="/creditreportingpolicy/">credit reporting policy</a> for more information;</li>
            <li>we need to do so to manage the provision of energy to you or it is a matter covered by our customer contract;</li>
            <li>we want to keep you informed about products or services;</li>
            <li>we want to recover money from you when you have not paid us, or if we want to list any payment defaults with a credit agency;</li>
            <li>you are switching to another energy retailer; </li>
            <li>the distribution company needs or has requested the information. Some examples of when we may do this are if the information is to help supply energy or to distribute money on their behalf; or this is necessary to assist an adjudicator to resolve a complaint you make about us; or</li>
            <li>we need to do so for general business purposes, (such as aggregating customer consumption information to track trends) or corporate purposes (such as financing, reporting, sale or purchase of businesses etc). </li>
          </ul>

          <p>After you cease to be a customer we will still use your personal information for our general business purposes (such as in aggregated consumption data), to call you if you switch away to finalise your account and get your feedback, and if you owe us money we will use your personal information to recover money from you or if we need to take action in relation to a payment default in accordance with our credit reporting policy. If we no longer require your personal information for any of the purposes for which it was collected we will then take all reasonable steps to destroy your personal information or ensure that your personal information is de-identified.</p>

          <p>Other than as outlined above, we will not share your information with anyone else.  This includes information about the account with anyone living at the property, except if they are also named on the account.</p>
