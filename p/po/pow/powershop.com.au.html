                        <li>you tell us we can do this;</li>

                        <li>the distribution company needs or has requested the information.  Some examples of when we may do this are if the information is to help supply energy or to distribute money on their behalf;</li>

                    <p>Other than as outlined above, we will not share your information with anyone else. This includes information about the account with anyone living at the property, except if they are also named on the account. You may ask us for access to any personal information we hold about you.

					<h3>Storage and security of personal information</h3>
                    <p>We will keep your personal information secure. Most personal information will be held in our customer application, however some personal information will be held in our physical files at our offices or in our computer network.

					<h3>Storage and security of customer keys and alarm codes</h3>
                    <p>Where Powershop's meter readers cannot access your meter outside the building, they will leave behind a key pack at the property by which you can send the key to our meter readers. Each key pack left behind is allocated to a particular meter reader so that when you send it with the key it can be tracked. When our meter readers receive a key pack from you, they allocate a specific key number to the pack and dispatch it to the relevant local area office, where it is stored in a locked safe. At the local offices a log book is kept where authorised staff sign the keys in and out when they are required for meter reading. Keys can only be identified as relating to a customer or property on our meter readers' key database, never on the actual key or key pack. Only authorised staff can access the key database.</p>
                    <p>If you have an alarm code that needs to be entered when meter readers use the key to your property, our key pack instructs customers to enter any alarm code in their account settings online. The alarm code is sent to our meter readers using encrypted files. Once received, the alarm codes are entered into the key database of our meter readers, which are only able to be accessed by authorised staff. The alarm code is also available electronically for a short period via a password-protected PDA (personal digital assistant) to meter readers who need the key when they are about to read the meter at your property. In some very limited instances the alarm code may be available in hard copy for our meter readers to use during their meter rounds.</p>
                    <p>If and when you wish to have your key returned or destroyed, our crew will (after verifying you as the customer) either return the key to an address that is different from the relevant property or destroy the key.</p>
