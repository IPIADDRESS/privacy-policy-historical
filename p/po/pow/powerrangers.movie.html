AND THE RELATED TERMS OF USE LOCATED AT <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lionsgate.com/corporate/terms">http://www.lionsgate.com/corporate/terms&nbsp;</a>CAREFULLY
BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE.</p><p>This website is operated by Lions
Gate Entertainment Corp. on its own behalf or in combination with one of its
film or television divisions or joint ventures (collectively referred to
herein, solely for ease of reference, as “Company”, “us” or “we”). This privacy
policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all of the online and mobile websites and
interactive applications operated by Company (unless a different policy is
provided on a particular site or application, in which case such different
policy shall control). Protection of personal and sensitive information is
paramount. This Privacy Policy discloses what type of information is collected,
the methods used to collect it, how Company utilizes the information to better
serve all interested parties and the choices you have about the way your
information is collected and used. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
Your use of any Company website indicates that you have read, accepted and
unconditionally agreed to the Company privacy practices, as outlined in this
Privacy Policy and any other applicable terms. The Terms of Use for this
website are incorporated herein by this reference.</p><p><strong>Children</strong><span><br>
We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and
encourage parents to check and monitor their children’s use of online activities
regularly. This website supports and complies with the Children’s Online
Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and other applicable laws. This website is not
aimed at nor intended for children under the age of thirteen (13). If you are
under the age of thirteen (13), please do not use this website, and if you are
over the age of thirteen (13) but under the age of eighteen (18), you should
use this website only with the involvement and permission of a parent or legal
guardian. Our website does not accept registration from children under the age
of thirteen (13). No personally identifiable information is purposefully or
knowingly collected from children under the age of thirteen (13) by Company
without parental consent. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, personally
identifiable information (“PII”) is personal information about an individual,
such as a first and last name, phone number or email address or other
individually identifiable information within the meaning of COPPA and the
Federal Trade Commission’s Online Privacy Protection Rule found at 16 CFR
312.2. If Company discovers that a person under the age of thirteen (13) has
provided Company with any PII, Company will use commercially reasonable efforts
to delete such person’s PII from its system. Every user hereby agrees that all
information you provide, including but not limited to age, shall be truthful
and correct.</span></p><p><strong>Information
We Collect</strong><span><br>
Company strives to provide our visitors with information relevant to their
particular desires, needs and/or interests. The information we gather helps us
to better serve our purpose. We may ask you to provide us with demographic
information, information regarding your interests or other PII. Providing us
with PII about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide
certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or
participate in some of the website’s features. Company actively and passively
gathers, analyzes and/or stores PII and other information generally by way of
four different sources: (1) the PII voluntarily submitted by visitors when
using or registering to use or receive our services or offers; (2) the PII
visitors voluntarily provide when participating in any contests, sweepstakes
and/or other promotions; (3) the PII visitors voluntarily provide when buying
or ordering merchandise through the website; and (4) by tracking and analyzing
online and mobile data and activity through mechanisms that identify site
usage, browser types, IP addresses, and other data. This last source of
information is explained in greater detail over the next several sections of
this Privacy Policy.</span></p><p><strong>Non-Personally
Identifiable Information</strong><span><br>
When your computer or mobile device contacts our web servers (for example, when
you visit this website, scan a Microsoft Tag or QR code, or view an HTML
email), our web servers automatically collect usage information. Such usage
information includes information about how our visitors use and navigate our
website. It can include the number and frequency of visitors to each web page
and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the
web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our website, and IP addresses
(see below for more information on IP addresses). We also may determine the applicable
technology available in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a
web page, email, advertising or promotional announcement or similar service.
This information is used to analyze and improve this website and to provide you
with a more fulfilling and relevant experience.</span></p><p><strong>Browser
Cookies</strong><span><br>
Like many websites, we use browser “cookies”. Cookies are a website’s way of
remembering who you are. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your
computer’s hard drive or stored temporarily in your computer’s memory. There
are two kinds of cookies: those that are “session” oriented and those that are
“persistent”. Session cookies delete from your computer when you close your
browser. Persistent cookies retain information for later use tomorrow, next
week, next month, or whenever they are set to expire. We use cookies to help us
to identify account holders and to optimize their experience on our website.
Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves
this website without checking out. Also, we will use cookies to monitor and
maintain information about your use of this website. Most web browsers accept
cookies automatically. You can delete cookies manually or set your browser to
automatically delete cookies on a pre-determined schedule. For example, in the
Internet Explorer menu bar, select: Tools &gt;Internet Options &gt; Browsing
History &gt; Delete to view manual and automatic options. If you decline to
accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in
certain features of this website.</span></p><p><strong>Flash
Cookies</strong><span><br>
Our website enables the use of the Adobe Flash Player. Adobe’s Flash Player is
used by the vast majority of websites that offer video and other interactive
content. By default, your use of the Adobe Flash Player generates “flash
cookies” (also known as “persistent identification elements” or “local shared
objects”). Adobe provides a short disclosure about Flash Cookies in its End
User License Agreement, stating “Use of the web players, specifically the Flash
Player, will enable the Software to store certain user settings as a local
shared object on our computer. These settings are not associated with you, but
allow you to configure certain settings within the Flash Player.” The Adobe
Flash Player (and similar applications) use flash cookies to remember user
settings, preferences and usage similar to the browser cookies referenced
above, but flash cookies can store more information than browser cookies and
are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web
browser. You can control the degree to which you accept flash cookies by
accessing your Adobe Flash Player management tools directly through the
settings manager for Adobe Flash, located at </span><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>. If you
do not allow flash cookies to take any disc space on your computer, you may not
be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features on the website.
Users with a computer running the Windows operating system can view flash
cookie files in this folder: \Documents and Settings\[username]\Application
Data\Macromedia\Flash Player. Users with a computer running the Apple operating
system can view flash cookie files in this folder:
/users/[username]/Library/Preferences/macromedia/Flash Player. Flash cookies,
or LSO files are stored typically with an “.SOL” extension.</p><p>Although the Adobe Flash Player
is used by the vast majority of websites that offer video content and/or games,
it is not the only technology being used in the ever-shifting online and mobile
content environment. HTML5 is an increasingly popular web standard used for
presenting content, especially content delivered to mobile devices. HTML is the
mark-up language used for the World Wide Web. Almost all web pages you visit on
the internet are based around HTML code. HTML5 is simply the fifth and latest
iteration of this mark-up language that allows for more interactive web pages.
One of the real benefits of HTML5 is its potential to standardize the highly
fragmented rich-media universe. Some HTML5 code may allow your response to
advertising and other activities to be monitored across websites and such
information to be stored on your computer or mobile device. Technology
solutions that allow users to opt-out of or block this sort of tracking are
being developed through browser add-ons and other tools.</p><p><strong>Web
Beacons</strong><span><br>
Our web pages or email messages may contain a small graphic image called a web
beacon, which is sometimes also called a "clear gif", that allows us
to monitor and collect certain limited information about our users, such as the
type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that
the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons
can be very small or invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic
image viewed as part of a web page or email, including HTML based content, can
act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to our web pages
or to monitor how our users navigate our website, and we may include web
beacons in email messages in order to count how many of the messages we sent
were actually opened or acted upon. We use web beacons to compile aggregate
statistics about our website and our marketing campaigns.</span></p><p><strong>Use of Javascript and Analytics</strong><br>Our websites and applications may employ Google Analytics which uses a first-party cookie and JavaScript code that is stored on Google’s servers to anonymously track how users interact with our websites and applications, including where they came from and what they did on our properties. Company does not link the information collected by Google Analytics to the PII you provide when registering with our website or application.
</p><p><strong>Use of
IP Addresses</strong><span><br>
An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network when you
are linked to the Internet. When you request pages from this website, our
servers log your IP address. We may use IP address for a number of purposes,
such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business
partners or to audit the use of the website. We may associate your IP address
with the PII you provide. We also may collect and store information about you
that we receive from other sources to enable us to update and correct the
information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations
and special offers that we think will interest you.</span></p><p><strong>Sensitive
Information</strong><span><br>
There are two ways sensitive information (e.g. credit card numbers) may be
obtained. When a visitor makes a purchase, his/her information may be sent
directly to a third party authorization center that will relay to Company
whether to proceed with the transaction. The information is not at all stored
in our system. The second way is when a visitor pre-orders merchandise. In this
case, the information is sent to a non-public server and stored until the transaction
is complete.</span></p><p>Company uses all possible
efforts to ensure the safety of your sensitive information. No website,
internet transmission, computer system or wireless connection is completely
secure. Company cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss,
or other breaches will never occur. Your use of the Company website is at your
own risk. Company urges you to take steps to keep your information safe by
memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place (separate from your
account information), logging out of your account, and closing your web
browser. In order to help us protect your sensitive information and PII
further, you should be careful about providing your password to others.</p><p>Whenever you give Company
sensitive or confidential information, Company will take commercially
reasonable steps to protect the information by establishing a secure connection
with your web browser. Company uses the Security Socket Layer (“SSL”), an
industry standard security protocol for encrypting sensitive information.
Unfortunately, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and data
transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed 100% secure. We cannot and
do not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to
Company and you do so at your own risk. Unless otherwise specified herein or on
the site where you make a purchase, credit card numbers are used only for
payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes.</p><p><strong>External
Links</strong><span><br>
Company may contain links to, or advertisements about, non-Company websites.
Other sites may also reference, advertise, or link to Company websites. Company
does not endorse or sponsor other websites, is not responsible for the privacy
practices or the content of non-Company sites, expressly disclaims any
statements or assertions made on such websites, and denies all liability
associated with your use of, and the content on, such other websites and
advertisements. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy
Policy do not apply to information gathered through other websites. We
encourage you to be aware of when you leave this website and to read the
privacy policies of each and every website that you visit.</span></p><p><strong>Consent
to Processing in the United States</strong><span><br>
This website is operated in the United States. By providing any information to
Company, all users, including, without limitation, users in the member states
of the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, fully
understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy. By using our
website, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your
information, you consent and agree to the collection, transfer, storage and
processing of your information to and in the United States.</span></p><p><strong>Sharing
Information</strong><span><br>
We may provide information to select outside companies when we believe their
products or services may be of interest to you. If you opt in to receive
communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the
third party's privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy. Therefore, if you
later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you
will need to contact the third party directly. In addition, Company may share
your PII with third parties under the following circumstances:</span></p><p>Third parties providing
services on our behalf: We may engage third parties to perform services in
connection with the operation of our business. Examples of these services
include: (a) payment processing and authorization, (b) fraud protection and
credit risk reduction, (c) product customization, (d) order fulfillment, (e)
shipping, (f) marketing and promotional material distribution, (g) website
evaluation, (h) data collection, storage, management, analysis and, where
applicable, cleansing, and (i) any other services designed to assist us in
maximizing our business potential. These third parties may have access to this
website’s user information, including PII, to the extent it is needed to
perform their duties and functions.</p><p><u>Company Security</u>: We may
release information about our users, including PII, when legally required to do
so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, or
to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our website and
applicable laws. We may also disclose such user information whenever we believe
disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Company,
or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers or others.</p><p><u>Aggregate Information</u>: We may
disclose non-identifying, aggregated user statistics to third parties for a
variety of purposes, including describing our services to prospective partners
and other third parties. Examples of such non-personal information include the
number of users who visited this website during a specific time period or
purchased a specific product through this website.</p><p><u>Promotions</u>: If you
choose to enter a contest, sweepstakes or promotion, your PII may be disclosed
to third parties in connection with such promotion, including without
limitation for purposes of posting your entry with attribution or otherwise as
permitted in the official rules for the promotion in question, fulfilling your
prize or including your name on a winners list. Also, by entering a promotion,
we may require you to consent to the use of your PII or other information, such
as name, voice or likeness, in advertising, promotional and marketing
materials. In addition, we may offer certain promotional content, such as a
sweepstakes, sponsored by or co-branded with a third party, who may obtain the
PII that you submit.</p><p><u>Corporate change</u>: In
addition, we reserve the right to disclose, share and/or otherwise transfer
user information, including without limitation PII, in connection with a
corporate merger, acquisition, consolidation, the sale of a portion of our
business or the sale of substantially all of Company’s assets, or other
fundamental corporate change, whatever form it may take. You will be notified
via email or prominent notice on our website prior to a change of ownership or
control of your personal information, if your personal information will be used
contrary to this policy. For clarification and the removal of doubt, Company
specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of PII collected
pursuant to this Privacy Policy from this website, off-line or otherwise, to
the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.</p><p><strong>Third
Party Advertisements</strong><span><br>
We may from time to time use various outside ad-serving or other companies to
serve advertisements on our website. In the process of serving advertisements,
such companies may use cookies, and may use information about your visits to
our website and other websites in order to provide advertisements on our
website about products and services that may be of interest to you. By
delivering ads on our website, and the use of cookies, the ad-server is able to
record what ads a user has seen, and what pages the user was viewing when the
ads were delivered. This web usage information may be combined with other ad
delivery information the ad-server has collected from your visits to our
website and other websites not affiliated with Company. This non-personally
identifiable information is used as part of the ad-serving process for reporting,
and to select and direct the ads you see on our website and on other websites
not affiliated with us.</span></p><p>
Some of these third party advertising service providers may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool, located at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp&quot;">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>, and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising, located at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.

</p><p><strong>How Can
I Access, Correct and Update Personal Information?</strong><b>&nbsp;</b><span><br>
You can access, correct and update certain personal information that you have
provided to us by emailing us at&nbsp;</span><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:legal@lionsgate.com">legal@lionsgate.com</a>. Please
be aware that we will process your request as quickly as we reasonably can, but
it may not be possible to update our systems immediately. In addition, you
should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete
all of your information from our databases without some residual data because
of backups and other reasons.</p><p><strong>Your Choices/Unsubscribe</strong><span><br>
You will have an opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving promotional material
from this website by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained
in promotional emails we send you. Additionally you may email us at </span><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank">legal@lionsgate.com</a>.
Because customer lists often are prepared well in advance of an offering
(sometimes a few months before the offer is made), you may continue to receive
some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for
specified marketing purposes. Please be aware that we will process your request
as quickly as we reasonably can, but it may not be possible to update our
systems immediately. We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us
time to carry out your request.</p><p>Even if you are removed from
any such list, if you order online, we will send you an email confirming your
order and may need to contact you by phone, email, or regular mail if we have
questions about your order. In addition, you should be aware that it is not
always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our
databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.</p><p>If you want to opt out of
having your PII shared with third parties for marketing purposes, you must
consistently opt-out at each of our websites where you register and whenever
you provide PII to us. Please bear in mind that this opt-out choice for
"third parties" will not apply to Company, Company licensees and/or
co-branding participants, as set forth below. Please also keep in mind that any
opt-out choices you make will not apply in situations where (a) you either have
made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for information
from us, or (b) Company uses your PII for either operational purposes (e.g., to
complete transactions requested by you, or to send you administrative
communications either about your account with us or about features of our
websites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy, or any other
policy or terms that affect you and your use of our website) or fulfillment
purposes (e.g., sharing with companies that facilitate communications and
transactions with you).</p><p>Finally, if you do not exercise
your opt-out choices upon registration or otherwise at the time the PII is
provided, it may take some time to process your opt-out choices. Our systems
require time to update, and promotional mailings using PII shared before your
opt-out may already be in process. Thus, your PII might continue to be shared
with third parties for promotional purposes for some time after you make your
request. For similar reasons, if your PII is shared with a third party, Company
largely or completely loses control over how that information is used. Thus,
even after you have opted out of allowing us to share your PII, you might
continue to receive promotional materials from third parties unless and until
you duly register your opt-out request with each third party in question.</p><p>If you would like further information in relation to your legal rights under applicable law or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us using the information in the “Contact Us” section below at any time. Your local laws may provide you:</p><ul style="font:normal 14px/20px ProximaNovaRegular; color: #81898f; list-style-type: square;"><li>the right to request information regarding how your personal data is processed;</li><li>the right to have your personal data rectified if inaccurate or out of date;</li><li>the right to have your personal data erased in certain limited circumstances;</li><li>the right to object to certain processing or to have certain processing restricted; </li><li>the right to have your personal data transferred from one data controller to another;</li><li>the right to revoke your consent to the processing of your information; and</li><li>the right to lodge a complaint with your national data protection regulator. </li></ul><p>We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.</p><p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the relevant regulatory authority in respect of data protection issues. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the regulator so please contact us in the first instance.</p><p><strong>Data Retention</strong><br>
We will process your personal data for no longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.<br>
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
</p><p><strong>Notice
to California Residents/Your California Privacy Rights</strong><span><br>
California residents are entitled once a year to request and obtain certain
information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal information to third
parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior
calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2018 will receive information about 2017
sharing activities). As set forth in this Privacy Policy, we comply with this
law by offering our visitors the ability to tell us not to share your
personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct
marketing purposes. To make such a request, consistently exercise your opt-out
choice whenever you provide PII to us or send an email to </span><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:legal@lionsgate.com">legal@lionsgate.com</a>. You
must include this website as the subject line, and your full name, email
address, and postal address in your message. Please see the "Your
Choices/Unsubscribe” section of this Privacy Policy for additional information.</p><p><strong>Forums/Message
Boards</strong><span><br>
Please review our restrictions on use and guidelines for user forums in our
Terms of Use. In addition, please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply
to any information you may disclose publicly in user forums (such as chat
rooms, message boards, or similar web pages). You should keep in mind that
whenever you publicly disclose information about yourself online, that
information could be collected and used by people that you do not know. In
addition, certain message boards (and similar user forums) may display IP
addresses and possibly PII along with the message poster's name and message.
Company assumes no responsibility for any action or policies of any third
parties who collect any information users may disclose in user forums or other
public areas, if any, of this website.</span></p><p><strong>Film

to Privacy Policy</strong><span><br>
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, update, add to,
discontinue, remove or otherwise change any portion of this Privacy Policy, in
whole or in part, at any time. When we amend this Privacy Policy, we will
revise the “last updated” date located at the top of this Privacy Policy. For
changes to this Privacy Policy that we consider to be material, we will place a
notice on the website by revising the link to read substantially as “Updated
Privacy Policy” for a reasonable amount of time. If you provide information to
us or access or use the website in any way after this Privacy Policy has been
changed, you will be deemed to have unconditionally consented and agreed to
such changes. The most current version of this Privacy Policy will be available
on the website and will supersede all previous versions of this Privacy Policy.</span></p><p><strong>Choice
of Law</strong><span><br>
This Privacy Policy, including all revisions and amendments thereto, is
governed by the internal laws of the State of California, without regard to its
conflict or choice of law principles which would require application of the
laws of another jurisdiction.</span></p><p><strong>Arbitration</strong><span><br>
By using this website in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that:
(1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or
otherwise) you may have against the officers, directors and employees of
Company and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates (all such individuals and
entities collectively referred to herein as the “Company Entities”) arising out
of, relating to, or connected in any way with the website or the determination
of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved
exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted
before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this
arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate
commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9
U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles, California;
(4) the arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions
of this Privacy Policy and any of the other agreements referenced herein that
the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the website; (5)
the arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the FAA and
applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege
recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be
arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your
and/or the applicable Company Entity’s individual claims; the arbitrator may
not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be
similarly situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award
punitive damages against you or any Company Entity; (8) in the event that the
administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration
against any Company Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required
under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount,
Company agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to
ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to
demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to
the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of your filing and hearing
fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to
prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception
of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be
invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of
