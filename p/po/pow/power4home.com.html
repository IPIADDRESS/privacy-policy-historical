		Russel's Privacy Guarantee</font></h3>
        <p align="center"><font size="3" color="#000099" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>My 
          Privacy Guarantee is really quite simple:<br>
          I respect yours.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you need more 
          detail than that, please read on.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I believe that clients 
          like you deserve to be treated with the utmost respect. And that includes 
          respecting your right to privacy. Here’s how I guarantee that.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Data Collection 
          and Storage</strong><br>
          I’ve designed and structured my entire site so that you can visit 
          and browse without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. 
          The only way for me to obtain any personal information about you at 
          all is for you to tell me yourself. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example, when 
          you place an order or ask me for information, I may store your name, 
          address and telephone number and/or email address on my secure server. 
          Any information that is not needed immediately to process your order 
          or request is transferred to my secure, offline database which cannot 
          be accessed from the Internet. Your credit card number will be deleted 
          automatically from my secure servers 31 days after you order. To comply 
          with tax laws, I may keep a printed copy of your order on file in my 
          Accounting Department.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Your Email 
          Address</strong><br>
          Your email address may be automatically added to my internal database 
          whenever you:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Place an order.<br>
          2. Request a quote.<br>
          3. Subscribe to my newsletter.<br>
          4. Request additional information by email.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
          Like most online merchants, my website uses “cookies” to 
          enhance your online shopping experience. Cookies are just little packages 
          of data that my server sends to your computer. They cannot tell me anything 
          about you or your computer and no other website or server except mine 
          can access the cookies my site sends. Cookies simply allow me to track 
          the contents of your shopping cart and personalize my site content. 
          Without them, you’d have to write down each item you wanted to 
          buy and then type the information into a manual form to complete your 
          order. What a hassle! </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks to cookies, 
          ordering is quick and easy. You can browse all my product pages, just 
          click on the items you want to add to your cart and my system will store 
          them until you’re ready to check out. And, when you come back 
          to shop the next time, you won’t have to re-enter your name and 
          address info again – the cookies remember it for you, so that 
          the checkout process is quick and convenient every time you shop. For 
          your peace of mind though, I will ask you to re-enter your credit information 
          every time you shop. I don’t permit my cookies to store this information. 
          This also allows you to choose a different payment option, if you wish.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>IP Address</strong><br>
          My server automatically receives and records information on my server 
          logs from your browser including your IP Address and information about 
          the page you have requested to view. This tells us which pages my clients 
          are most interested in, and helps me tailor my site according to my 
          customers’ wants and needs.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Surveys and Questionnaires</strong><br>
          From time to time, I may post an online survey or questionnaire. Your 
          participation is completely voluntary, but greatly appreciated because 
          these help me by providing opinions, demographic or customer satisfaction 
          data. I use that information to enhance my customers’ online experience 
          by tailoring my products and services according to your preferences 
          and by offering the site content that interests you most.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How I Use 
          your Personal Information</strong><br>
          If you have ordered from me or requested any information, I will have 
          personal information such as your name, mailing address and/or email 
          address on file. I may use this information for my own purposes only 
          – to send you promotional offers, my newsletter 
          or customer satisfaction surveys for feedback on your purchases. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Occasionally, I 
          may use your email address to let you know about new products, services 
          or special offers on my site that I think would interest you. I might 
          also email previous customers for feedback on their shopping experience. 
          Any message I send you will always include clear, simple instructions 
          for having your name and information permanently deleted from my lists, 
          if you prefer. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Security 
          of your Information</strong><br>
          I have several security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse 
          and alteration of the information I control. These measures include 
          password protection, encryption and my off-line database, which is not 
          accessible by those on the Internet. I also conduct pre-hire criminal 
          background checks on ALL my employees. For more information on these, 
          and other security measures, please see my detailed
		<a class="special" href="Security.htm">Security 
          Guarantee</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>My Information 
          Non-Disclosure GUARANTEE</strong><br>
          I will never sell, rent, give, share or otherwise disclose to any third 
          party any information that you may provide to me about you, your business, 
          your website or your methods and procedures, without your knowledge 
          or consent without a subpoena or court order.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How to Change 
          your Information or Opt Out</strong><br>
          If you wish to have me remove your personal information from my databases, 
          simply send a blank email with “remove” in the subject line 
          to:

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you need to update the 
          information I currently have on file (new address/email address, etc.),

          Too!</strong><br>
          I’m committed to a strict “No Spam” policy. Whenever 
          you receive any message from me, it will contain clear, simple instructions 
          for having your name and information permanently removed from my lists.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please note: For 
          tax and legal purposes, I am not allowed to destroy paper records of 
          orders placed with me. However, I will comply with ALL requests to remove 
          your information from my email and print mailing lists.</font></p>

          to This Policy</strong><br>
          I reserve the right to amend this policy as needed. But I’ll never 
          change my Information Non-Disclosure Guarantee. If I make any substantial 
          changes in my use of your personal information or if I am required by 
          law to share your data, I will notify you.</font></p>
