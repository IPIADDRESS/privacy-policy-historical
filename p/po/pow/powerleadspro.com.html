					<h1>Privacy</h1>
					<p><strong>PowerLeadsPro.com</strong> strives to offer its visitors the many 
	advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and 
	personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information 
	(your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the 
	terms of this privacy policy. "We will never sell, barter, or rent your 
	email address to any unauthorized third party. Period.‚Äù </p>
	<h3>How we gather information from users </h3>
	<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are 
	visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services 
	provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you 
	register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain 
	features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide 
	information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards 
	and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web 
	sites, PowerLeadsPro.com also collects information automatically and through 
	the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For 
	example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie 
	technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among 
	other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you 
	from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control 
	the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting 
	our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information 
	through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with 
	information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept 
	cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the 
	site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not 
	be able to customize the sites features according to your preferences. </p>
	<h3>What we do with the information we collect </h3>
	<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit 
	and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your 
	privacy and do not share your information with anyone. </p>
	<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify 
	you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about 
	your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to 
	help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited 
	most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may 
	occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, 
	this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information 
	about you or allow anyone to identify you individually. </p>
	<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on 
	PowerLeadsPro.com to communicate with you about your registration and 
	customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services 
	and products offered by PowerLeadsPro.com and other topics we think you 
	might find of interest. </p>
	<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by PowerLeadsPro.com may 
	also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site 
	administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, 
	administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with 
	you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation 
	of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such 
	information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In 
	addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may 
	sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such 
	transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may 
	also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times 
	when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection 
	with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement 
	authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may 
	not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases. </p>
	<h3>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements </h3>
	<p>PowerLeadsPro.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to 
	respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, 
	including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers 
	accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection 
	policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may 
	link to, or view as part of a frame on a PowerLeadsPro.com page, certain 
	content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through 
	PowerLeadsPro.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access, 
	information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other 
	parties. PowerLeadsPro.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of 
	such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of 
	those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated 
	by a third party. </p>
	<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third 
	parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of 
	your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our 
	advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable 
	the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement 
	before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by 
	third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. 
	PowerLeadsPro.com does not control the use of this technology by third 
	parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions 
	or policies of such third parties. </p>
	<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally 
	Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that 
	information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third 
	parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from 
	other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control 
	of PowerLeadsPro.com and this policy. </p>
	<h3>Children </h3>
	<p>PowerLeadsPro.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally 
	Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted 
	by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 
	13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. 
	If you believe PowerLeadsPro.com has any information from or about anyone 
	under 13, please contact us at the address listed below. </p>
	<h3>Contacting Us. </h3>

	<h3>Changes to this Policy </h3>
	<p>PowerLeadsPro.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. 
	Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our 
	site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept 
	those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted 
	will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the 
	information was collected. </p>
	<h3>Governing law </h3>
	<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by New York law. If a 
	dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with 
	the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: 
	Queens County. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with 
	the mediation will be shared equally by each of us. </p>
	<p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution 
	through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at 
	the following location: Queens County, under the rules of the American 
	Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration 
	may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so. </p>
	<p>PowerLeadsPro.com is controlled, operated and administered entirely 
	within Nevada. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not 
	intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on 
	behalf of any party.</p>
