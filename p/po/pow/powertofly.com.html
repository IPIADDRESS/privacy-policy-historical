        PowerToFly Inc. ("PowerToFly", "we" or "us") is committed to respecting the
        privacy of your information. This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") describes the
        personal information we collect through our website and any mobile applications
        (the "Site"), and how we collect and use this information. Terms not defined in this
        Privacy Policy have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Service, available
        <a class="link" target="_blank" href="/terms">here</a>.
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h3 class="highlight">1. COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h3>
    <p>
        Depending on how you use the Site, we may ask you to share personally identifiable
        information ("Personal Information") with us. Whether you choose to share
        your Personal Information is completely up to you, but keep in mind that you
        may not be able to access some areas of the Site or effectively use the services
        we offer on the Site without sharing Personal Information. Personal Information
        includes any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact or locate
        you. Examples include your name, address, email address, phone number, age,
        educational background and credit card information. Below are some examples of
        when we collect Personal Information.
    </p>
    <p>
        1.1 Basic Account Information. When you register for the Site, we will ask you to
        provide your name and e-mail address or to log in using an existing social media
        account. Please see paragraph 4 regarding the information that we may collect
        from such social media accounts. We may use your email address to send you
        account confirmations, notifications, and to otherwise provide services to you in
        connection with the Site. We also use your Personal Information for administrative
        purposes, such as addressing account and billing issues, troubleshooting Site issues,
        investigating abuse on the Site, responding to inquiries and enforcing and applying
        our Terms of Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        1.2 Contractors. If you are registering as a Contractor, we may also ask for the
        following information: phone number, Skype ID, photo, work history, educational
        background, location, biographical information and skills. Contractors have the
        option to control whether Personal information is made publicly available on the
        Site through the Contractor’s profile privacy settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        1.3 Companies. If you are registering as a Company, we may also ask for the
        following information: phone number, location, company name, company logo,
        website URL, company size and contact person(s).
    </p>
    <p>
        1.4 Reviews and Other Public Content. Companies may have the opportunity to
        provide reviews about Contractors they have used. Users may also have other
        opportunities to contribute to the Site, such as public forums, bulletin boards and
        talk threads. We may store these contributions ("Public Content"), display them to
        other Users, and use them for promotional purposes. Your Public Content becomes
        public information once you post it, and copies of it may continue to be viewable
        even after you delete your account. Your Public Content may appear on other
        websites or web searches, and therefore this information can be read, collected and
        used by others. Note that if you include Personal Information about yourself in your
        Public Content, it can be used and viewed by others. Please remember that you are
        not permitted to disclose any Personal Information about another User or anyone
        else in your Public Content.
    </p>

    <p>
        1.5 Payment Information. To process payments, we will require your credit card
        information and billing information. Credit card transactions are processed through
        a third party, which only uses your information for that purpose.
    </p>

    <h3 class="highlight">2. COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h3>
    <p>
        Non-personal information is information that does not identify the specific User. This type of information may
        include things like the URL of the website you visited before and after visiting our
        Site, the type of browser you are using, and the IP address of the computer you use
        to visit the Site.
    </p>

    <p>
        2.1 Cookies. We collect some anonymous information about how you use the Site
        by setting and accessing cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that
        is stored on your computer. These cookies track information such as how often
        you visit the Site, what pages you view, and where you go after you leave the Site.
        The cookies track your computer, not you. They are not connected to any personal
        information about you. If you choose to disable a cookie, you may not be able to
        use certain features of the Site. PowerToFly uses cookies for authentication, to
        enable and support our security features and to help us detect malicious activity and
        violations of our Terms of Service. PowerToFly also uses cookies to learn about how
        the Site performs in different locations and to understand, improve, and research
        products, features and services. PowerToFly uses both persistent cookies and
        session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing User, to
        make it earlier for you to return to PowerToFly without signing in again. After you
        sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browsers and will be read by PowerToFly
        when you return o the site. Session cookies only last for as long as a session in the
        Site (typically, the current visit to a web site or a browser session).
    </p>

    <h3 class="highlight">3. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.</h3>

    <p>
        3.1 Disclosure By Law; Protection of Us and Others. We may disclose information
        you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in
        our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to (1) comply with the
        law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not
        such disclosure is required by applicable law), (2) protect or defend PowerToFly’s,
        or a third party's, rights or property, (3) protect someone's health or safety, such
        as when harm or violence against any person (including you) is threatened, or (4)
        enforce our Terms of Service.
    </p>

    <p>
        3.2 Permitted Disclosures. We may disclose information you provide: (1) if we
        have your consent, (2) where it is necessary to carry out your instructions, or (3) as
        reasonably necessary to provide our features and functionality to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        3.3 Service Providers. We may share information with vendors providing
        contractual services to us, such as your payment information, as appropriate to
        process your payments for the Services or complete a transaction.
    </p>

    <h3 class="highlight">4. INFORMATION FROM THIRD-PARTY SOURCES.</h3>
    <p>
        We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available
        sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other information we
        receive from or about you. For example, we may receive information about you from
        a social media site if you connect to the Services through that site. Please review
        the privacy policies of those social media sites if you would like more information
        regarding the data that the sites may provide us.
    </p>

    <h3 class="highlight">5. INFORMATION FROM THIRD-PARTY SOURCES.</h3>
    <p>
        You can change your information at any
        time by editing your profile or the content that you have posted. You can have
        your account deleted by sending a request via email to <span class="mail-obfuscation mail-hi"></span>. If your
        account is deleted, we will retain your account data in our system but will not share
        your information with others.
    </p>

    <h3 class="highlight">6. SECURITY OF INFORMATION.</h3>

    <p>
        We take security of your Personal Information seriously and take precautions
        to protect your Personal Information. We encrypt certain sensitive information
        using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, and implement other commercially
        reasonable procedures to protect your Personal Information. But, no method of data
        transmission over the Internet or data storage is 100% secure and therefore, we
        cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information transmitted to or from
        the Site.
    </p>

    <h3 class="highlight">7. AGE RESTRICTIONS.</h3>

    <p>
        The Site is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
        collect Personal Information from individuals under 13, and no part of the Site is
        designed to attract anyone under the age of 13. If you become aware that your child
        has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware
        that an individual under 13 has opened an account and provided us with Personal
        Information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate that person's
        account.
    </p>

    <h3 class="highlight">8. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY.</h3>

    <p>
        We may revise our Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version
        of the Privacy Policy will govern our use of your information and will always be
        located on this webpage. If we make a change to our Privacy Policy that is material,
        we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes before
        implementing the change on the Site and/or via the email associated with your
        account. By continuing to access the Site and use the Services after those changes
        become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h3 class="highlight">9. CONTACT US.</h3>

    <p>
        If you have any feedback, questions or complaints about this Privacy Policy or any of
        our privacy-related practices, please contact us directly at: <span class="mail-obfuscation mail-hi"></span>.
