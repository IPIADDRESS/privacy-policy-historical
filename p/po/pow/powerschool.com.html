            </p><p>The Internet is a unique communications medium and PowerSchool is committed to protecting the privacy of users 
              who utilize the PowerSchool student information system portal sites. PowerSchool fully discloses its policy 
              about the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and security of personally identifiable information obtained 
              from users of our online services. PowerSchool is especially sensitive of the need for children to consult with 
              their parents before furnishing personally identifiable information or ordering products online, and we make 
              special efforts to advise children to do so. We also urge parents to monitor and supervise their children's 
              online activities and use of software and other tools that may enhance their use. Throughout cyberspace, we 
              want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for users of services. </p>
            <p><b>SPECIAL ATTENTION TO KIDS</b></p>
            <p>PowerSchool takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of young people using our services. We do 
              not collect personally identifiable information about children under the age of 13 and require that children 
              under the age of 18 get their parents' consent before completing a child's registration with PowerSchool. </p>
            <p>PowerSchool does not rent, sell, exchange or share personally identifiable information with anyone else. The 
              term "personally identifiable information" means information including, without limitation, name, address, telephone 
              number, Social Security number, e-mail address, age or physical description.</p>
            <p>PowerSchool uses personally identifiable information about its Web site users only in defined and responsible 
              ways. When we gather personally identifiable information, we ask permission first. We also disclose, at the 
              time of collection, how the information will be used by us.</p>
            <p>PowerSchool complies with applicable law governing online privacy 
              including the Child Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment 
              Act and the <a href="coppa.html">Children Online Privacy Protection 
              Act</a>. If you would like to review these laws and their related 
              regulations we suggest you link to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's 
              Web site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov</a>

            <p>PowerSchool would like to remind our customers about how to comply 
              with federal laws applicable to school districts. Read more about 
              the <a href="ferpa.html">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 
              (FERPA)</a>.</p>
            <p>PowerSchool will collect personally identifiable information in relation to a users voluntary participation 
              in PowerSchool promotional contests. Under these circumstances, you have the option to volunteer additional 
              information, including but not limited to your e-mail address, mailing address and/or phone number for the purpose 
              of notifying winners. Personally identifiable information may also be used for activities such as site registration, 
              site membership, newsletter subscriptions and mailings that describe upcoming products, events and features. 
              This information will never be rented, sold, exchanged or shared with third parties.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.powerschool.com" target="_blank">PowerSchool.com</a> is a Web site for educators, parents 
              and students where information about the company can be obtained and general educational resources can be accessed. 
              On our Web site, users are able to request more information about PowerSchool, comment on the site, and apply 
              for employment. We collect name, address telephone numbers and e-mail information to fulfill the specific requests 
              of our site's users and may keep a record of the information for potential follow-up. We do not rent, sell, 
              exchange or share this information to third parties.</p>
            <p>Whenever possible, PowerSchool allows users to make choices about how their personally identifiable information 
              will be used.</p>
            <p>For all sites, we do gather log server data to use in the aggregate to analyze what features of the site are 
              used most often by site users.</p>
            <p><b>Non-personally identifiable information collected by PowerSchool FOR THOSE SITES THAT HAVE ELECTED TO RAISE 
              MONEY THROUGH SPONSORSHIP </b></p>
            <p>For those sites that have elected to raise money through sponsorship, 
              PowerSchool does collect non-personally identifiable information 
              about your computer, such as the server your computer is logged 
              onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), 
              and whether you responded to the ad delivered.</p>
            <p>We use a technology called "cookies" to customize banner ads and 
              promotions. Customization allows us to provide you with information 
              tailored to your unique tastes and interests. This makes it even 
              easier to find quickly the information that interests you the most. 
              This non-personally identifiable information collected by PowerSchool 
              is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness 
              on behalf of PowerSchool's sponsors. This information is only provided 
              in the aggregate - meaning that it's about our site as a whole. 
              We never distribute personally identifiable information about individual 
              users.</p>
            <p>To enable PowerSchool to compile meaningful reports for it's sponsors, Internet sites in general, including 
              PowerSchool collect the following types of non-personally-identifiable information about users who are served 
              advertisements by our sponsorships:</p>

                  (not your address), company, and type and size of organization.

                  and type (i.e., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system

            <p><b>OTHER WEB SITES</b></p>
            <p>When users access the Internet whether through links from the PowerSchool Web site or otherwise, they access 
              other Web sites not controlled by PowerSchool. PowerSchool is not responsible for those other Web sites, and 
              we recommend users carefully examine the privacy statements of Web sites. Personally identifiable information 
              that you choose to provide to other sites will be subject to the privacy policies of that Web site.</p>
            <p>If you think that any sponsors, advertisers, or links on our Web site are inappropriate, please contact us

            <p><b>SECURITY</b></p>
            <p>The security or personally identifiable information is a high priority at PowerSchool. We maintain our Web 
              site and all associated data with technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect against loss, 
              unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification and improper disclosure. PowerSchool uses industry-proven 
              security procedures such as encrypted administrative communication and restricted access to hardware. No computer 
              system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. Nonetheless, PowerSchool is 
              committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect our Web site and its information 
              against foreseeable hazards. You may want to check with your local school to determine what safeguards they 
              have in place to protect personally identifiable information on their systems.</p>
            <p>PowerSchool might be required to disclose personally identifiable information in response to valid legal process. 
              This includes a search warrant, subpoena or court order. In this respect, we are no different than any other 
              record keeper. Disclosures also may be appropriate to protect the safety of a child, during emergencies if physical 
              safety is believed to be at risk, to protect the security or integrity of our Web site, or to take precautions 
              against liability. We think that these events are unlikely, but they are possible. PowerSchool will take reasonable 
              steps to limit the scope of any of these disclosures.</p>
            <p><b>UPDATES AND QUESTIONS</b></p>
            <p>This policy may be updated from time to time. Our philosophy of protecting user information from inappropriate 
              uses and disclosures will not change. If you have any complaints or questions about this privacy statement,
