		<p>By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBB<em>OnLine</em>Â® Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the programs' strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnLine. Further information about this program is available at <a href="http://www.bbbonline.org" target="_blank">bbbonline.org</a>.</p>
		<p>ConeXware has established this Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.</p>
		<p>Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home.

		</ul>
		<p>In the event of a transfer of ownership of ConeXware, Inc., such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice before any Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

		<h1>Choice</h1>
