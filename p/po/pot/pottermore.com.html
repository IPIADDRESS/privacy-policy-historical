Your payment details</h2><p>We will never send you an email containing your full payment details, and we will never publicly disclose your payment details, whether on the Pottermore Shop or elsewhere. If you appear to have received an email from us, or seen a Pottermore Shop page, that displays your full payment details, this is not genuine – a third party may be attempting to steal your information. Please see section 10 for further information on how we protect the payment information held for you for the Pottermore Shop.</p><a name="section-07"></a><h2>7. Other types of information we collect and use</h2><p>7.1 We aim to provide a number of features that help provide a more personalised and enhanced experience to our users. To achieve this, we may collect and use a limited amount of non-personal information from you. In addition, we may ask you about which books and films in the Harry Potter series you have enjoyed. We will never publicly disclose any such information on the Site without obtaining your permission.</p><p>7.2 We also collect non-personal data, including aggregated, statistical data about visitors to the Site and traffic patterns (and share it with third parties such as our Partners). This information does not identify you in any personal capacity; it simply gives generalised information about the users of the Site. Please see below for more information on our use of cookies and similar technologies.</p><p>7.3 We also use watermarking technology to help us combat hacking, piracy and the unauthorised use of books sold through the Pottermore Shop. This involves the use of code numbers to help us to identify individual copies of a book. We may use such watermarking technology to identify items purchased through your Pottermore Account to help us investigate and protect against hacking, piracy, unauthorised use and any other behaviour that may be in breach of our <a href="/about/terms">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> or applicable laws.</p><p>7.4 We may disclose information that does not identify you personally, including aggregated or de-identified data, in our discretion.</p><a name="section-08"></a><h2>8. Cookies and similar technologies</h2><p>8.1 While you are using the Site, certain information is automatically logged about how you are using the Site to analyse performance and usage of the Site. This information may include, for example, the URL of the website which linked you to the Site, your IP address and the pages you visit while on the Site. The IP address indicates the location of your computer on the internet.</p><p>8.2 A “cookie” is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your device’s hard drive. References below to cookies also include other means of automatically accessing or storing information on your device. Many browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies as you prefer: please see section 8.4 below for further details.</p><p>8.3 We use various different types of cookie via the Site.</p><ul><li>We use cookies that are necessary and/or useful for the functioning of the Site. For example, if you use the Pottermore Shop, we use “session cookies” (which will usually be deleted when you log out) to keep track of your internet session while on the Pottermore Shop, which, for instance, allow us to remember the items you add to your shopping basket and the site language and currency you have selected to use. Without these cookies the online services that you have asked for cannot be provided.</li><li>We also use “persistent cookies” (which are longer-term) (and other automatically tracked information) to help you move around and enjoy the features on the Pottermore Shop more easily and to remember settings to improve your visit (at your request), such as your site language preferences or whether you want to be signed in automatically next time you visit.</li><li>We also use cookies to help improve the performance of the Site and to provide you with a better, more personalised user experience.</li><li>We also use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly.</li></ul><p>So cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's key features, which if you choose to decline cookies, mean you may not be able to sign in or to use other interactive features of the Site and its services that depend on cookies.</p><p>In further detail, Pottermore cookies fall into the following categories, which we have documented to help you understand the types of cookies that are used to improve your browsing experience on the Site:</p><h3>Analytics (e.g. Google Analytics; Webengage)</h3><p>These cookies are used to compile various (anonymised) metrics for our users to get a better understanding of how the Site is used (pages visited and time spent on the Site, for example), so that we can deliver more of the content you want, and less of the content you don’t. This information also helps us to make better decisions for our future initiatives. We use partners like <a href="http://webengage.com/privacy">Webengage</a> and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en-GB/policies/technologies/types/">Google Analytics</a>. These analytics cookies are set by those partners, and set in accordance with the relevant partner’s own privacy and cookies policies.</p><h3>E-commerce (Shopify)</h3><p>Used via the Pottermore Shop to manage your shopping basket and user experience. We use <a href="https://www.shopify.co.uk/legal/cookies">Shopify</a>. These e-commerce cookies are set by Shopify in accordance with its own privacy and cookies policies.</p><h3>Customer Service (ZenDesk)</h3><p>Our customer services partner ZenDesk sets cookies if you visit the ZenDesk Help Center to improve your experience and understand your user preferences. These website cookies are set by ZenDesk in accordance with its own privacy cookies policies.</p><h3>Performance data</h3><p>This lets us track how long it takes users to load each page, what pages we can cache and whether we need you to log in again. We don’t use any third parties for this.</p><h3>Embedded video (YouTube)</h3><p>We know that many of you love the films, so we make use of clips on YouTube to highlight certain elements of the story. YouTube sets its own cookies, and the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/">YouTube cookies policy</a> can be found here.</p><h3>Social media (Twitter)</h3><p>J.K. Rowling isn’t just a master of novel writing – she’s also pretty handy within the confines of 140 characters! In order to host her tweets, we embed Twitter links. Twitter sets its own cookies, and <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170514">Twitter’s cookies policy</a> can be found here.</p><h3>Preferences</h3><p>We use this type of cookie to ensure that we don’t show you things you’ve already seen before, like the cookie policy acceptance and the intro page. This means you get to spend more time with the content you love, and less time with the content you don’t.</p><h3>Session state</h3><p>Websites often collect information about how users interact with a website. This may include the pages that users visit most often, and whether users get error messages from certain pages. We use these so-called “session state cookies” to help us improve our services, in order to improve our users’ browsing experience. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not render the Site unusable.</p><p>The cookies outlined above expire after varying periods from around 30 minutes up to 2 years or more. The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies last until you stop browsing and persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted.</p><p>By continuing to use the Site, you are providing your consent for us to use cookies in these ways, but you can disable any of these cookies at any time if you wish (as set out below).</p><p>8.3 You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your web browser that allows you to refuse the setting of cookies, or you can modify your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it. The Help portion of your browser, most likely found on the toolbar, typically tells you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. You can check whether these settings are currently enabled on your computer – or find out how to change your current settings – here:</p><p>Javascript: <a href="www.enable-javascript.com">www.enable-javascript.com</a></p><p>Cookies: <a href="www.whatarecookies.com">www.whatarecookies.com</a></p><p>Unless you do this, cookies will be issued when you use the Site, but you can disable them via your browser at any time. If you do not accept cookies or decide to disable them, you will still be able to access and use the Site, but you may lose some features and functionality. For example, you cannot remain signed in to your Pottermore Account if you disable cookies.</p><p>If you wish to restrict or block web browser cookies which are set on your device, then you can do this by going to the help menu within your internet browser. Alternatively, you may wish to visit the “manage cookies” section on <a href="www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>, which contains information on how to prevent cookies from being stored on your device.</p><p>To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a></p><p>You can find out more about cookies at <a href="www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a href="www.youronlinechoices.eu">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p><a name="section-09"></a><h2>9.
