We do not combine this information with any other information that could identify you personally. We use this information to analyse how the Site is functioning and how it is used by our users, to help us maintain and improve the Site on an ongoing basis.</p><p><strong>Performance data</strong></p><p>While using the Site, certain information is automatically logged about how you are using the Site to analyse performance and usage of the Site. This information may include the URL of the website that linked you to the Site, your IP address and the pages you visit while on the Site. The IP address indicates the location of your computer on the internet. We use this information to analyse how the Site is functioning and how it is used by our users, to help us maintain and improve the Site on an ongoing basis.</p><p><strong>Third-party analytics data</strong></p><p>Like many companies that operate websites, we allow carefully selected third parties to set cookies in order to capture analytics information, where permitted. When you use social-media functionality on the Site, analytics cookies may be set to measure usage. This information may be linked to your device, but otherwise is collected in a way that does not identify you personally.</p><p>3.3 <strong>Children’s privacy</strong>. In various countries, local data protection laws treat individuals under a certain age (<strong>“Relevant Age”</strong>) as children whose personal data require additional protection under such laws. In the UK, for example, the Relevant Age is 13 for the purposes of obtaining valid consent from individuals by online means. For any given country in which Site users are based: (a) we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the Relevant Age; and (b) if we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a Site user under the Relevant Age, we will delete such information from our records. If you believe your child has provided us with personal information and you would like to have the personal information deleted, please contact us using the contact information below.</p><p>3.4 <strong>Minors’ privacy in the context of the Pottermore Shop</strong>. In the context of purchasers from the Pottermore Shop, we do not knowingly use personal information from persons under the age of majority in the relevant country. If we become aware that a person under the age of majority in the relevant country is attempting to access the Pottermore Shop, we may use technical measures to prevent such person from entering into transactions on the Pottermore Shop. If you believe your child has provided us with personal information and you would like to have the personal information deleted in such context, please contact us using the <a href="#section-17" target="_self">contact information below</a>.</p><p>3.5 <strong>Special data</strong>. We do not seek to collect any special categories of personal data about you: those would include details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data. Nor do we seek to collect any information about criminal convictions and offences. If, however, when using any interactive feature of the Site (such as an online contact form or questionnaire), you in fact provide us with any such special data or information about criminal convictions and offences, then by submitting such data/information, we’ll assume that you are fine with our use of such data/information for (a)&nbsp;the purpose for which you have voluntarily provided such data/information and (b) any purpose that is reasonably compatible with such purpose. You may withdraw that permission at any time by <a href="#section-17" target="_self">contacting us</a>.</p><p>3.6 <strong>If you fail to provide data</strong>. Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract that we have with you and you fail to provide those data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract that we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with products or digital content). If so, we shall notify you if this is the case at the time.</p><p><a id="section-04"></a></p><h2>4. How else may we use the information we collect?</h2><p>4.1 <strong>Legal action</strong>. We may use the information we collect to comply with law, to investigate a complaint made by another user or a potential breach of the Site’s <a href="/about/terms">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> or to prevent and detect unlawful or criminal activity, fraud and misuse of, or damage to, the Site or the products, content and services made available through it, and to take appropriate legal action against those responsible. Such use will be necessary to comply with a legal obligation or necessary for our and/or others’ legitimate interests (in being protected from such potentially harmful/unlawful acts or omissions).</p><p>4.2 <strong>Linking data</strong>. We may on occasion link or combine the information that we collect about you with information that we receive from other sources. We may combine this information with information you give to us and information we collect about you. (For example, we may decide to combine two or more databases into a single database of user information.) We may use this information and the combined information for your and/or our benefit (for example, to allow us to provide a more seamless support whenever you contact us or to provide you with better, personalised services and content and/or, if you have opted to receive such communications, recommendations about trusted partners’ products, content or services that might interest you). Such use will be necessary for our legitimate interests (in improving our operation and your experience of the Site).</p><p>4.3 <strong>Change of purpose</strong>. We shall only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected the data, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use such data for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you would like to get an explanation of how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please <a href="#section-17" target="_self">contact us</a>. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we&nbsp;shall notify you and explain the legal basis on which we intend to rely.</p><p>4.4 <strong>Legal use</strong>. Please note that we may also process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, if and to the extent that this is required or permitted by law.</p><p><a id="section-05"></a></p><h2>5. Information sharing and disclosure</h2><p>We share your personal information in certain limited ways as described below. We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We refer below to “Internal Third Parties” and “External Third Parties”, which are defined in <a href="#section-16" target="_self">section 16.2</a> below.</p><p>5.1 If you disclose personal information to us when contacting us with a query or placing an order, we may share that personal information with relevant Internal Third Parties and/or External Third Parties for the purpose of handling your query or order and (for merchandise) fulfilling your order, for fraud prevention and for the purposes of operating, managing and administering (including, without limitation, transaction processing on) the Site.</p><p>5.2 We may share your information with other External Third Parties for the performance of any contract we enter into with them in connection with the Site.</p><p>5.3 We may further share and disclose your personal information with other External Third Parties for the purpose of better integrating their services with the Pottermore Shop. Before we share or disclose any of your personal information with any Internal Third Parties and/or External Third Parties for marketing purposes, we will ask you for your permission to do so.</p><p>5.4 In addition, we may share information about visitors to the Site in an anonymous and aggregate form with relevant Internal Third Parties and/or External Third Parties to understand user trends and patterns and to manage and improve our business relationships.</p><p>5.5 We do not send any information that we collect on the Site to any social networking sites, nor do we share that information with such sites. We do not collect any personal information about you from those sites.</p><p>5.6 We may disclose information we collect, including personal information, as set out below:</p><p>(a) to Internal Third Parties and/or External Third Parties for them to administer any accounts or services provided to you through the Site as described above (including, if you are a Registered User, in relation to the registration, creation and operation of your Pottermore Account);</p><p>(b) if you consent to receiving marketing communications from Internal Third Parties and/or External Third Parties, to those third parties, for them to send you marketing communications regarding products, content and services they offer;</p><p>(c) if there is a change (whether in whole or in part) in the ownership, operation or control of Pottermore Limited, our business or any of our assets, including a change as a result of insolvency or bankruptcy, we&nbsp;may disclose information to the new owner, operator or controller and, if we do so, we&nbsp;will require such person to use it only (i) in accordance with the terms of our Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy (or terms that compatible with those) and/or (ii) as may be required or permitted by law;</p><p>(d) apart from the use and sharing of your personal information in the circumstances already described, we may share information we collect (including personal information) as required or allowed by law (for example, as needed to protect our and our licensors’ rights and property or to comply with any applicable law or valid legal process);</p><p>(e) to affiliated companies and/or joint venture partners in connection with the Site; and/or</p><p>(f) with your permission.</p><p><a id="section-06"></a></p><h2>6. Your payment details</h2><p>We will never send you an email containing your full payment details, and we will never publicly disclose your payment details, whether on the Pottermore Shop or elsewhere. If you appear to have received an email from us, or seen a Pottermore Shop page, that displays your full payment details, this is not genuine – a third party may be attempting to steal your information. Please see section 10 for further information on how we protect the payment information held for you for the Pottermore Shop.</p><p><a id="section-07"></a></p><h2>7. Other types of information we collect and use</h2><p>7.1 We aim to provide a number of features that help provide a more personalised and enhanced experience to our users. To achieve this, we may collect and use a limited amount of information from you that does not (in itself) identify you personally. In addition, we may ask you about which books and films in the Harry Potter series you have enjoyed. We will never publicly disclose any such information on the Site without obtaining your permission.</p><p>7.2 We also collect non-personal data, including aggregated, statistical data about visitors to the Site and traffic patterns (and share it with third parties such as our Partners). This information does not identify you in any personal capacity; it simply gives generalised information about the users of the Site. Please see below for more information on our use of cookies and similar technologies.</p><p>7.3 We also use watermarking technology to help us combat hacking, piracy and the unauthorised use of books sold through the Pottermore Shop. This involves the use of code numbers to help us to identify individual copies of a book. We may use such watermarking technology to identify items purchased through your Pottermore Account to help us investigate and protect against hacking, piracy, unauthorised use and any other behaviour that may be in breach of our <a href="/about/terms">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> or applicable laws.</p><p>7.4 We may disclose fully anonymised information, including aggregated or de-identified anonymous data, in our discretion.</p><p><a id="section-08"></a></p><h2>8. Cookies and similar technologies</h2><p>8.1 While you are using the Site, certain information is logged about how you are using the Site to analyse performance and usage of the Site. This information may include, for example, the URL of the website which linked you to the Site, your IP address and the pages you visit while on the Site. The IP address indicates the location of your computer on the internet.</p><p>8.2 A “cookie” is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your device’s hard drive. References below to cookies also include other means of automatically accessing or storing information on your device. Many browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies as you prefer: please see section 8.4 below for further details.</p><p>8.3 We use various different types of cookie via the Site.</p><ul><li>We use cookies that are necessary and/or useful for the functioning of the Site. For example, if you use the Pottermore Shop, we use “session cookies” (which will usually be deleted when you log out) to keep track of your internet session while on the Pottermore Shop, which, for instance, allow us to remember the items you add to your shopping basket and the site language and currency you have selected to use. Without those cookies the online services that you have asked for cannot be provided.</li><li>We also use “persistent cookies” (which are longer-term) (and other automatically tracked information) to help you move around and enjoy the features on the Pottermore Shop more easily and to remember settings to improve your visit (at your request), such as your site language preferences or whether you want to be signed in automatically next time you visit.</li><li>We also use cookies to help improve the performance of the Site and to provide you with a better, more personalised user experience.</li><li>We also use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly.</li></ul><p>So cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's key features, which if you choose to decline cookies, mean you may not be able to sign in or to use other interactive features of the Site and its services that depend on cookies.</p><p>In further detail, Pottermore cookies fall into the following categories, which we have documented to help you understand the types of cookies that are used to improve your browsing experience on the Site:</p><h3>Analytics (e.g. Google Analytics; Webengage)</h3><p>These cookies are used to compile various (anonymised) metrics for our users to get a better understanding of how the Site is used (pages visited and time spent on the Site, for example), so that we can deliver more of the content you want, and less of the content you don’t. This information also helps us to make better decisions for our future initiatives. We use partners like <a href="http://webengage.com/privacy">Webengage</a> and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en-GB/policies/technologies/types/">Google Analytics</a>. These analytics cookies may be set by those partners, and set in accordance with the relevant partner’s own privacy and cookies policies. Please see section 8.4 below for information on opting out of Google Analytics.</p><h3>E-commerce (Shopify)</h3><p>E-commerce cookies may be used via the Pottermore Shop to manage your shopping basket and user experience. We use <a href="https://www.shopify.co.uk/legal/cookies">Shopify</a>. Certain e-commerce cookies may be set by Shopify in&nbsp;accordance with its own privacy and cookies policies.</p><h3>Customer Service (ZenDesk)</h3><p>Our customer services partner ZenDesk may set cookies if you visit the ZenDesk Help Center to improve your experience and understand your user preferences. Those website cookies would be set by ZenDesk in accordance with its own privacy and cookies policies.</p><h3>Performance data</h3><p>This type of cookie lets us track how long it takes users to load each page, what pages we can cache and whether we need you to log in again. We don’t use any third parties for this.</p><h3>Embedded video (YouTube)</h3><p>We know that many of you love the films, so we make use of clips on YouTube to highlight certain elements of the story. YouTube may set its own cookies, and the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/">YouTube cookies policy</a> can be found here.</p><h3>Social media (Twitter)</h3><p>J.K. Rowling isn’t just a master of novel writing – she’s also pretty handy within the confines of 140 characters! In order to host her tweets, we embed Twitter links. Twitter may set its own cookies, and <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170514">Twitter’s cookies policy</a> can be found here.</p><h3>Preferences</h3><p>We use this type of cookie to ensure that we don’t show you things you’ve already seen before, like the cookie policy acknowledgement and the intro page. This means you get to spend more time with the content you love, and less time with the content you don’t.</p><h3>Session state</h3><p>Websites often collect information about how users interact with a website. This may include the pages that users visit most often, and whether users get error messages from certain pages. We may use these so-called “session state cookies” to help us improve our services, in order to improve our users’ browsing experience. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not render the Site unusable.</p><h3>Krux</h3><p>The Krux cookie is a third-party cookie that may be set for Registered Users once logged in. It is set by member(s) of the Warner Bros. group of companies and may be used to track the&nbsp;Registered User’s behaviour across Warner Bros. online and mobile sites and to serve relevant advertising on those sites.</p><p>The cookies outlined above expire after varying periods from around 30 minutes up to 2&nbsp;years or more. The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies last until you stop browsing and persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted.</p><p>If you carry on using the Site, we’ll assume that you are fine with our use of cookies in these ways, but you can disable any of these cookies at any time if you wish (as set out below).</p><p>8.4 You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your web browser that allows you to refuse the setting of cookies, or you can modify your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it. The Help portion of your browser, most likely found on the toolbar, typically tells you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to&nbsp;have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. You can check whether these settings are currently enabled on your computer – or find out how to change your current settings – here (but note that Pottermore does not control these third-party resources):</p><p>Javascript: <a href="http://www.enable-javascript.com">www.enable-javascript.com</a></p><p>Cookies: <a href="http://www.enable-javascript.com">www.whatarecookies.com</a></p><p>Unless you do this, cookies will be issued when you use the Site, but you can disable them via your browser at any time. If you do not accept cookies or decide to disable them, you will still be able to access and use the Site, but you may lose some features and functionality. For example, you cannot remain signed in to your Pottermore Account if you disable cookies.</p><p>If you wish to restrict or block web browser cookies which are set on your device, then you can do this by going to the help menu within your internet browser. Alternatively, you may wish to visit the “manage cookies” section on <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>, which contains information on how to prevent cookies from being stored on your device.</p><p>To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across websites visit: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a></p><p>You can find out more about cookies at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p><p><a id="section-09"></a></p><h2>9.

Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in&nbsp;relation to your personal data:</p><ul><li>right of access to your personal data;</li><li>right to rectification of your personal data;</li><li>right to erasure of your personal data;</li><li>right to restriction of processing of your personal data;</li><li>right to portability of your personal data;</li><li>right to object to processing of your personal data;</li><li>right not to be subject to automated decision-making (including profiling); and</li><li>right to withdraw consent to processing of your personal data.</li></ul><p>To find out more about these rights, please see section 16 below and the ICO’s website (<a href="https://www.ico.org.uk">www.ico.org.uk</a>).</p><p>15.2 <strong>Exercising your rights</strong>. If you wish to exercise any of those rights, please <a href="#section-17" target="_self">contact us</a>. You can also access the personal information we hold on you (excluding Pottermore Shop transactional data) in your <a href="https://my.pottermore.com/my-details">My Details</a> page in your Pottermore Account.</p><p>15.3 <strong>No fee usually required</strong>. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or&nbsp;to exercise any of the other rights). We may, however, charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in those circumstances.</p><p>15.4 <strong>What we may need from you</strong>. We may need to request specific information from you to&nbsp;help us confirm your identity and to ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data are not disclosed to any person that has no right to receive such data. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p><p>15.5 <strong>Time limit to respond</strong>. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we shall notify you and keep you updated.</p><p><a id="section-16"></a></p><h2>16. Glossary</h2><p>16.1 <strong>Lawful basis</strong>.</p><p><strong>“Legitimate interest”</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best services/products/content and the best and most secure experience. We make sure that we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to do so by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by <a href="#section-17" target="_self">contacting us</a>.</p><p><strong>“Performance of a contract”</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p><p><strong>“Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation”</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation to which we are subject.</p><p>16.2 <strong>Third parties</strong>.</p><p><strong>“Internal Third Parties”</strong> means other entities that are direct or indirect subsidiaries of Pottermore and/or owned and/or controlled (directly or indirectly) by J.K. Rowling from time to time (acting as co-controllers or as processors), which are based in&nbsp;the EU or USA and provide certain operational and/or administrative services to us and/or otherwise in relation to the Wizarding World, and includes the officers, employees and agents of such entities who are involved in such services. Such agents include The Blair Partnership and J.K. Rowling’s private family office, each based in the UK.</p><p><strong>“External Third Parties”</strong> means:</p><ul><li>Service providers and other commercial partners (acting as processors) based in the UK, EU or USA that support us in fulfilling our contractual obligations and in operating our business, including those providing us with certain account-registration, marketing, public-relations and data-processing services, order fulfilment services, payment processors, delivery services, customer services and IT and communication services (such as server-hosting, CRM-platform, email and telephony providers), and includes the officers, employees and agents of such entities who are involved in such support role. Such public-relations service providers include JKR PR (a partnership between Stonehillsalt PR Ltd and Mark Hutchinson Management Limited), based in the UK.</li><li>Members of the Warner Bros. group of companies from time to time (acting as co-controllers or as processors) principally based in the USA or the UK that have produced and/or are producing audio-visual content, merchandise and/or other products or digital content based on the Wizarding World, and includes the officers, employees and agents of such entities who are connected with any such activity.</li><li>Professional advisers (acting as co-controllers or as processors), including lawyers, bankers, accountants and insurers, who are based in the UK, EU or USA and provide their respective professional services to us.</li><li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities (acting as co-controllers or as processors), which are based in the UK and may require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances, and includes their relevant personnel.</li></ul><p>16.3 <strong>Your legal rights</strong>.</p><p>In certain circumstances, you have the following legal rights in relation to your personal data:</p><p><strong>Right of access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing such data.</p><p><strong>Right of rectification</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data that you provide to us.</p><p><strong>Right to erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for our continuing to process such data. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Please note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p><p><strong>Right to restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you would like us to establish the accuracy of such data; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p><p><strong>Right to portability</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. If you so request, we shall provide you, or a third party that you have chosen, with a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to automated information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p><p><strong>Right to object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you believe that it affects your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.</p><p><strong>Right not to be subject to automated decision-making</strong> (including profiling) where that would have a significant effect on you. We do not in fact engage in such activities, so this right will not, in practice, be relevant in the context of your use of the Site.</p><p><strong>Right to withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. This will not, however, affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products, content or services to you. We shall inform you if that is the case at the time when you withdraw your consent.</p><p><a id="section-17"></a></p><h2>17.
