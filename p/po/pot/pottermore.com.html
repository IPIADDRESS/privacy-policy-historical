We will never send you an email containing your full credit or debit card number and we will never publicly disclose your payment details, whether on Pottermore or elsewhere. If you appear to have received an email from us, or seen a Pottermore page, that displays your full credit or debit card number or otherwise discloses your payment details, this is not genuine – a third party may be attempting to steal your information. Please see paragraph 10 for further information on how we protect the payment information we hold for you on Pottermore.</p><h3 id="other-information"><span class="n">7</span> Other types of information we collect and use</h3><p><span class="n">7.1</span> We aim to provide a number of features on Pottermore that help provide a more personalised and enhanced experience to our users. To achieve this, we may collect and use a limited amount of non-personal information from you. In addition, we may ask you about which books and films in the Harry Potter series you have enjoyed. We will never publicly disclose any such information on Pottermore without obtaining your permission.</p><p><span class="n">7.2</span> We also collect aggregated statistics data about visitors to Pottermore and traffic patterns (and share it with third parties such as our Partners). Just to be clear, this information does not identify you in any personal capacity; it simply gives generalised information about the users of Pottermore.</p><p><span class="n">7.3</span> We also use watermarking technology to help us combat hacking, piracy and the unauthorised use of books sold through the Pottermore Shop. This involves the use of code numbers to help us to identify individual copies of a book. We may use such watermarking technology to identify items purchased through your Pottermore Shop Account to help us investigate and protect against hacking, piracy, unauthorised use and any other behaviour that may be in breach of our Terms or applicable laws.</p><h3 id="cookies"><span class="n">8</span> Cookies and similar technologies</h3><p><span class="n">8.1</span> While on Pottermore, certain information is automatically logged about how you are using Pottermore to analyse performance and usage of Pottermore. This information may include the URL of the website which linked you to Pottermore, your IP address and the pages you visit while on Pottermore. The IP address indicates the location of your computer on the internet. </p><p><span class="n">8.2</span> Like many online services we use a feature called a “cookie”, which is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your device’s hard drive. References to cookies also include other means of automatically accessing or storing information on your device.  Cookies enable us to identify your device when you have logged in.  We use cookies that are strictly necessary for the functioning of Pottermore. For example, we use ‘session cookies’ to keep track of your internet session whilst on the Pottermore Shop which, for instance, allows us to remember the items you add to your list of intended purchases in your shopping basket.</p><p>You can find out more about cookies at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p><p>Without these strictly necessary cookies the online services that you have asked for cannot be provided. We also use cookies (and other automatically tracked information) to help you move around and enjoy  the interactive features on Pottermore.com more easily and to remember  settings to improve your visit (at your request) such as your site language preferences or whether you want to be signed in automatically next time you visit. We also use cookies to help improve the performance of Pottermore and to provide you with a better user experience. We use ‘analytics cookies’ (such as Google Analytics cookies) to keep track of our users’ browsing activity whilst on Pottermore. The information that we collect through such analytics cookies is aggregated and anonymous and is only used to help us improve how our website works and to understand what interests our users by showing us, for example, which pages you visit.</p><p>The information does not identify you as an individual user. If you have come to Pottermore through one of our Partners, we may use an ‘affiliate cookie’ to help us recognise which Partner helped you to find us. We also use online behavioural advertising cookies to work out what advertising might be most relevant to you based on the areas you look at on our site. These cookies look at your IP address to provide information about where you are located. We also allow third party marketing, analytics and other service providers to collect information about your browsing activities and to provide tailored advertising. Third-party targeted advertising cookies collect information about your browsing activity across multiple websites and online services in order to provide you with relevant advertisements on our websites and online services and the websites and online services of third parties. Ad networks may share this information with the advertisers using their network. The information collected using these cookies does not identify you personally. Please be aware that third parties may use their own cookie tags when you click on a link on our website and that these third parties are responsible for their own privacy and cookie compliance policies.</p><p>We use cookies to give you the very best experience on Pottermore and to allow you to make use of all the site features. If you visit Pottermore without changing your cookie settings the cookies we use will be sent to your device. By continuing to use Pottermore you are providing your consent for us to use cookies in these ways but you can disable any of these cookies at any time if you wish (as set out below). Please also see our Help pages for guidance on how to do so. Please note, if you disable certain cookies, this may limit your use of Pottermore.com and the Pottermore Shop. Disabling analytics cookies and affiliate cookies will not limit your use of the sites. <br></p><p><span class="n">8.3</span> You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies, or you can modify your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it.</p><p>You can check whether these settings are currently enabled on your computer - or find out how to change your current settings - here:</p><p>Unless you do this, cookies will be issued when you use our site, but you can disable them via your browser at any time. If you do not accept cookies or decide to disable them you will still be able to access and use the site but you will lose some features and functionality. For example, you won’t be able to remain signed-in if you disable cookies. </p><p>If you wish to restrict or block web browser cookies which are set on your device then you can do this by going to the help menu within your internet browser.

Read the <a href="/en/terms">Terms</a> for further information on these links. In particular, you will see in paragraph 5.5 of the Terms that users are not permitted to distribute or post any links including links to websites, files or links that open or run programs. We strongly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any such websites that you visit.</p><h3 id="protection"><span class="n">10</span> How do we protect personal information?</h3><p><span class="n">10.1</span> As required by UK Data Protection laws, we follow strict security procedures in relation to the storage and disclosure of information which you have given to us in order to protect against unauthorised access. In particular, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt all your passwords and check-out pages. SSL encrypts the information you provide as it travels through the internet. Encryption creates millions of code combinations to protect each transaction made on the website, so your password or information cannot be viewed by anyone else using the internet. Despite using this technology, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you disclose to us. You accept the inherent risks of providing information and dealing online and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security that is due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</p><p><span class="n">10.2</span> If you have any concerns about security, please refer to our <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/en/help">Help</a> pages in the first instance.</p><h3 id="email-settings"><span class="n">11</span> Editing your settings and unsubscribing from Pottermore emails</h3><p><span class="n">11.1</span> We do not send marketing communications to users under 16 years of age.</p><p><span class="n">11.2</span> If you are a user aged 16 or above and you have previously consented to receiving marketing communications, you can withdraw this consent at any time by changing your Account Settings in either your Pottermore Account or your Pottermore Shop Account.
