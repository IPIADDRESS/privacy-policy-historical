<h2 id="changes">2. Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><span class="n">2.1</span> We may make any change to this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes we will notify you by sending you an email to the last email address that you provided to us and/or by posting a copy of the changes on Pottermore. Subject to paragraph 2.2, any changes will take effect seven (7) days after the date of our email or the date we post the modified terms on Pottermore, whichever is earlier. Your continued use of Pottermore after that period expires means that you agree to be bound by the modified terms. As noted in our <a href="/en/terms">Terms</a>, you are responsible for keeping your account information up to date, including your parent or guardian’s email address. If the email address to which we send notification to you under this clause is no longer valid, the sending of our email (notifying you of any changes to the Terms) will be deemed, nonetheless, to be effective notice of the modified terms.</p>
<p><span class="n">2.2</span> If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use and/or share personal information, we will give you prominent notice of these changes and offer you a choice about whether the changes should apply to any personal information that we previously collected from you. If we make material changes to how we collect and use personal information from children under the age of 13, we will notify parents or guardians by email in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of your child’s personal information.</p>

<p><span class="n">6.2</span> We also collect and share aggregated statistics data about visitors to Pottermore and traffic patterns with third parties such as our Partners. Just to be clear, this information does not identify users in any personal capacity; it simply gives generalised information about the users of Pottermore.</p>
</div>
<div class="category">
<h2 id="cookies">7. Cookies</h2>
<p><em>Cookies and log files</em></p>
<p><span class="n">7.1</span> While on Pottermore, certain information is automatically logged about how you are using Pottermore to analyse performance and usage of Pottermore. This information may include the URL of the website which linked you to Pottermore, your IP address and the pages you visit while on Pottermore. The IP address indicates the location of your computer on the internet. </p>
<p><span class="n">7.2</span> Like many online services we may use a feature called a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. It allows us to recognise you as a user when you return to Pottermore using the same device and web browser. We use the cookies (including some provided to us through online analytics services such as Google Analytics) and other automatically tracked information to: </p>
<ul>
<li>store login details. For example, to authenticate you as a user when you log in; </li>
<li>enable you to move more easily around Pottermore; and </li>
<li>track visitors to Pottermore to analyse performance and usage of Pottermore, in order to develop Pottermore in accordance with visitors’ requirements. </li></ul>
<p><span class="n">7.3</span> You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. You can set your internet browser so that it will not allow cookies to be stored on your device. This may reduce functionality of Pottermore and may mean that certain features or content will not be available to you. Further information on how to prevent cookies from being stored on your device can be found on <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a> under the 'manage cookies' section. Alternatively, you can access further information by going to the help menu within your internet browser.

</div>
<div class="category">
<h2 id="links">8. Links</h2>
<p><span class="n">8.1</span> Pottermore contains links posted by us to third party websites that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Read the <a href="/en/terms">Terms</a> for further information on these links. In particular, you will see in paragraph 5.5 of the Terms that users are not permitted to distribute or post any links including links to websites, files or links that open or run programs. We strongly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any such websites that you visit.</p>
</div>
<div class="category">
<h2 id="protect-information">9. How do we protect personal information?</h2>
<p><span class="n">9.1</span> As required by UK Data Protection laws, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given to us to prevent unauthorised access. In particular, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt all your passwords. SSL encrypts the information you provide as it travels through the internet. Encryption creates millions of code combinations to protect each transaction made on the website, so your password or information cannot be viewed by anyone else using the internet. Despite using this technology, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you disclose to us. You accept the inherent risks of providing information and dealing online and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to our negligence or wilful default.</p>
<p><span class="n">9.2</span> If you have any concerns about security, please refer to our <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/en/help">Help</a> pages in the first instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="category">
<h2 id="editing-settings">10. Editing your settings and unsubscribing from Pottermore emails</h2>
<p><span class="n">10.1</span> We do not send marketing communications to users under 16 years of age.</p>
<p><span class="n">10.2</span> If you are a user aged 16 and above and you have previously consented to receiving marketing communications, you can withdraw this consent at any time by changing your Account Settings in your Experience Account. If you click on the “unsubscribe” link in any marketing communication, it will take you to the Account Settings page.</p>

</div>
<div class="category">
<h2 id="deleting">12. Deleting your account</h2>
<p><span class="n">12.1</span> If we suspend or withdraw access to your account for any reason, we will delete your account and any personal information, including any user generated content associated with your account, after six (6) months of withdrawing access unless we reinstate your account or receive a request from you to delete your account sooner (please see paragraph 12.2 for further details).

<p><span class="n">12.3</span> If, having logged on to your child’s Experience Account, you inform us that you do not wish your child to use Pottermore, we will suspend access to your child’s Experience Account immediately and delete their account (and any personal information collected from them, including any user generated content associated with their account) seven (7) days after receiving your request. Please refer to our <a href="/en/child-safety">Child Safety</a> policy for further details.</p>

<h2 id="transfer-info">13. Transfer of information outside the EEA</h2>

<p><span class="n">13.4</span> By submitting your personal data to Pottermore, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These steps include our use of model clauses issued by the European Commission to cover transfers of personal data outside of the EEA, or, in the case of the USA, using third parties which have notified the US Department of Commerce that they adhere to the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">Safe Harbor</a> framework.</p>
