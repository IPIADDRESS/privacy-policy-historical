		<p>Welcome to Pottermore, the digital home of the Harry Potter books (“Pottermore”). Pottermore includes an interactive online platform known as “Pottermore.com”, which is described in more detail in our <a href="/en/terms">Terms and Conditions</a> (“Terms”), as well as an online eBook and digital audio book shop known as the “Pottermore Shop”. Pottermore is owned by Pottermore Limited (referred to as “we”, “us” or “our” as appropriate, a company established in England and Wales). Pottermore is currently available through the website at <a href="/">http://www.pottermore.com</a>. We may also make Pottermore or other versions of it available through a number of digital channels or devices. </p><p>We strive to make Pottermore.com a fun, safe and secure platform for adults and children of all ages to use. We understand that, as parents and guardians, you wish to ensure that your children can use websites on the internet in a way that allows them to interact with others responsibly and safely. </p><p>Your child’s safety online is very important to us and we are committed to safeguarding the personal information we collect from them through Pottermore. As a result, we have taken a number of measures to create a rich, engaging yet safe environment through which children can explore the world of Pottermore and the magic of Harry Potter and enjoy eBooks and digital audio books purchased from the Pottermore Shop. This Child Privacy and Safety Policy sets out details of our approach to the safety of children on Pottermore. Some of the capitalised words appearing in this Child Privacy and Safety Policy are defined in our <a href="/en/terms">Terms</a>. This Child Privacy and Safety Policy primarily relates to Pottermore.com but we apply the same values and standards of child safety at the Pottermore Shop (although please be aware that Pottermore’s ecommerce services, including the Pottermore Shop, are intended for users of 18 years of age and above). </p><h3>OUR SAFETY MEASURES ON POTTERMORE.COM</h3><p>We understand how challenging it can be to find out exactly how websites use your child’s information and how important it is for any use of that information to be as transparent as possible. For this reason, we provide you with this guidance which, together with our <a href="/en/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, informs you exactly what information we collect about your child, how we use it and the measures we take to protect your child, so please do read them carefully. </p><p>We have taken the following measures to protect all children under the age of 18: </p><ul><li>We provide a limited social networking feature so that children can express ideas and upload pictures inspired by the Harry Potter series and their Pottermore experience. </li><li>We provide all users with a username which does not contain any personal information. </li><li>We monitor and review the contributions that your child and any other user make on Pottermore.com. We use a number of measures to assist us to effectively moderate Pottermore which include using a combination of software filters and specifically trained on-site staff who monitor activity and receive reports of any misuse or misconduct by users. </li><li>We only allow your child to register with Pottermore.com if they confirm they have obtained your permission to use Pottermore.com. </li><li>We only collect a limited amount of personal information from your child. Please see below and our <a href="/en/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for further details. </li><li>We will immediately suspend your child’s access to Pottermore.com if, having logged on to your child’s Pottermore Account, you inform us that you do not wish to permit your child to use Pottermore.com. We will delete their Pottermore Account (including any personal information collected from them) seven (7) days after receiving your request. </li><li>We want all our users, including children, to feel safe when using Pottermore. We therefore encourage all users to use our services responsibly. If we become aware that a user is harassing or bullying anyone through Pottermore, we will take firm and swift action against them, which may include temporary or permanent blocking of their access to Pottermore. </li></ul><p>What we don’t do</p><ul><li>We do not make your child’s access or participation on Pottermore.com conditional upon your child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for them to enjoy the services we provide. </li><li>We do not give out or display any information we collect about your child on Pottermore.com or any other website. </li><li>We do not allow users to send direct messages to each other on Pottermore.com. </li><li>We do not send any marketing messages to your child if they are under the age of 16. We will only send marketing messages to users over 16 if they have confirmed to us that they are happy to receive such messages and have told us that they have obtained your permission. </li></ul><h3>CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13</h3><p>We know how important it is for children of young ages to benefit from stronger controls and protections when using the internet. For this reason we take additional measures over and above those listed above, to make sure that children under the age of 13 are protected. These include: </p><ul><li>                In order for your child to enjoy all the features and services that we provide, your child can choose to register with Pottermore.com by creating a Pottermore Account. We encourage you to take an interest in your child’s behaviour when using Pottermore.com. We will only allow your child access to Pottermore.com if we have received your express permission to do so and checked with you that you have provided that permission. We will not store or use the limited personal information we collect from your child if you do not provide that permission. To help you through this process, we have explained below the steps of the process that will occur when your child wishes to register with and access Pottermore.com. This process is designed to protect the privacy of your child and to comply with data protection and privacy law.                 <ul><li>The registration process begins when your child tells us that they are under 13 years of age by entering their date of birth during the registration process. </li><li>If your child informs us they are under 13 years of age, we will ask them also to provide their first name, their country of residence and your email address so that we can obtain your permission. </li><li>                                We will send you an email to the email address that your child provided for you to inform you that they have registered a Pottermore Account. This email will ask you to indicate electronically whether you consent for us to collect the personal information your child has provided to us for the purposes we describe in this guidance and our <a href="/en/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and for your child to use and access Pottermore.com. The email will also contain:                                <ul><li>details of the types of personal information we have collected from your child and how we wish to use that information. This information is also set out in detail below in this guidance; </li><li>our confirmation to you that we will not collect any further personal information from your child and that we will not use any personal information we have collected, unless we have already received your permission to do so; </li><li>instructions as to how you can provide us with your consent electronically and agree to our <a href="/en/terms">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> on behalf of your child. </li>                                </ul>                        </li><li>If you indicate that you do not wish to provide your consent or if you do not respond to our email within seven (7) days of receiving it, we will not allow your child access to Pottermore.com and we will delete any personal information we have collected from them. </li><li>If you do provide your consent, we will allow your child access to Pottermore.com and electronically verify your consent. </li>                </ul>        </li><li>We only collect the limited personal information from your child which we request directly. For further details on the information we collect and how we use that information please see our <a href="/en/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. </li><li>We only use your child’s personal information for internal purposes. </li><li>We do not allow your child to link their Pottermore Account with a social networking site such as Facebook. </li><li>If we make material changes to how we collect and use personal information from children under the age of 13, we will notify you by email in order to obtain verifiable consent for the new uses of your child’s personal information. </li></ul><h3>OTHER TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE </h3><p>We aim to provide a number of features that help provide a more personalised experience to our users. To achieve this, we may collect a limited amount of non-personal information from your child. For example we may ask your child about which Harry Potter books and films they have enjoyed. </p><p>We also collect and share with third parties aggregated statistical data about visitors to Pottermore and their traffic patterns. This information does not personally identify your child. From time to time we may also collect further non-personal information however, just to be clear, this is anonymous information that does not identify your child in any personal capacity. </p><h3>WHO ELSE MIGHT USE YOUR CHILD’S DATA? </h3><p>In order to provide our services we are assisted by a limited number of third parties who provide us with the services that allows us to offer such an enjoyable and safe experience for your children and our users. They help us with operating, managing and administering the accounts and services provided to your child through Pottermore. </p><p>In the course of providing their services, these service providers may collect and/or keep personal information about your child.
