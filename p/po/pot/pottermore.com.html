                        <p>Last updated: May 16, 2019</p><p>This policy explains how we collect and use your data, and how we use cookies.</p><p>It covers all the data collection activities (online and offline) of two Wizarding World Digital entities, Wizarding World Digital LLC and Wizarding World Digital Limited (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”). It includes information that we collect through our various Wizarding World digital channels, such as websites, mobile apps, streaming services and third-party social networks, as well as through customer care centres, points of sale and events that link directly to this policy (together, the “<strong>sites</strong>”).</p><p>This policy tells you how you can access and update your personal information and make certain choices about how it is used. It also explains the rights you have to object to processing for direct marketing purposes, to object to processing that is not required by law or necessary for us to provide the sites, and how you can exercise those rights.</p><p>For certain offerings on our sites, there may be additional notices about our privacy practices and choices, each of which will be considered to form part of this policy.</p><h3>DATA CONTROLLERS</h3><p>This privacy policy is provided by Wizarding World Digital LLC and its subsidiary Wizarding World Digital Limited, which jointly control how your personal information is used. The Contact us section later in this policy explains how you can contact us.</p><p>In some cases, third parties may act as independent controllers of your personal information, as explained further below.</p><h3>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3><p><strong>Personal data and other personal information</strong>. When you interact with our sites, we may collect and combine different types of personal information. We refer to this as “<strong>information</strong>” for short. The information may include:</p><li><strong>Registration, account and sign-up information</strong>. We collect information about you in the course of your use of the site(s) or registration with us. For example, when you create or update an account, register for or download an app, or sign up for one of our offerings, you provide us with certain information, which includes your name and email address, and may include your social-media profile. We may also receive information about your interest in and use of various products, services, programs, virtual items, content and activities (which we refer to below as “<strong>products</strong>” for short) that are available on or through our sites. You may also provide or be allocated certain details, such as a nickname, user name, password, Wizarding World attributes and/or other profile information.</li><li><strong>Product purchase</strong>. If you make a purchase on one of our sites, our payment providers or the entity handling the sale will also collect certain payment information (e.g. payment method, billing information and delivery address).</li><li><strong>Information about others / inviting friends</strong>. In certain situations, we collect information submitted by people you know. For example, a friend might submit information to invite you to take part in an offering, send you a gift, make recommendations or share content. They also may provide your details through an “invite your friends” function or by importing contacts from their address book or from social media sites. By processing those requests, we will receive your information, including details such as your name, email address, social-media profile, postal address and/or telephone number, and/or information about your interests in and use of various products.</li><li><strong>Information from affiliates and third parties</strong>. We combine the information we process about you with information we receive from other organisations. This includes information from Warner Bros. and Pottermore affiliates, organisations sponsoring or co-branding our or our affiliates’ content, as well as demographic and other information from other business partners, advertising companies and research services.</li><li><strong>Wizarding Passport™</strong>. You may choose to register for one or more of our sites through a Wizarding Passport, which refers to both your account and certain of the information you provide or are allocated in connection with your account (such as your Hogwarts house, wand, patronus, pet etc.). Your Wizarding Passport will identify you as a “member” of the Wizarding World sites and services and will serve as your credentials for logging into and using the sites and services and for other purposes. If you use a Wizarding Passport to connect your Wizarding World account to an account maintained by one of our business partners, then we will share certain information from your profile with that partner. We will tell you what information will be shared before you connect with another organisation via the Wizarding Passport. When you do connect with that organisation, we may receive certain information in return (e.g. achievements in a game).</li><li><strong>Social media</strong>. You can engage with some of our content and offerings, such as videos, apps and other offerings on or through third-party communities, forums and other social media sites, services, plug-ins and apps (“<strong>social media sites</strong>”). When you link to our sites or interact with us or our content through social media sites, you may choose for us to receive certain information from your social media account (e.g. name, user ID, email address, social-media profile, photos and videos, gender, birthday, your list of friends and their contact details, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the “likes” you make). We may also receive information from your interaction with our content (e.g. content viewed and information about advertisements you have been shown or have clicked on).</li><li><strong>Location information</strong>. We may have access to certain information about your general location, such as your country or address, when you provide it or via information (such as an IP address or device settings) relating to your computer, mobile phone or other device. With consent (where required by law), we may also collect information about your device’s precise location (e.g. geolocation via mobile devices).</li><li><strong>Technical and usage information</strong>. We also collect certain technical and usage information such as the type of device, browser and operating system you are using, your internet service provider or mobile carrier, unique device identifier, IDFA or IDFV, MAC address, IP address, device and browser settings, the webpages and apps you use, advertisements you see and interact with, and certain site usage information across our sites and other sites and apps.

You can tell us if and how you would like to receive direct marketing from us, our affiliates and our or their advertising partners. To do this, or to find out more about this (i) log into an account you have created with us to adjust your settings or (ii) send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@wizardingworld.com">privacy@wizardingworld.com</a>. To opt out of receiving direct marketing communications via email, you can also follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided in any marketing email you receive from us. If you previously chose to receive alerts in the form of push notifications on your mobile device from us, but no longer wish to receive them, you can manage your preferences through your device settings, depending on the type of device.</p><p><strong>Advertising choices</strong>. We work with reputable third parties to present advertisements to you on our sites and on third-party websites and applications. Those third parties collect information in order to confirm if ads have been delivered and viewed. They may also obtain information about applications you use, websites you visit and information about your devices and browsers in order to help serve advertising that is more relevant to your interests. These ads could be served on our sites or on third-party sites and applications. This is known as interest-based advertising. Third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixels and/or similar technologies to perform this activity. They also use information to associate various browsers and devices together for the purpose of interest-based advertising and other purposes like analytics.</p><p>For more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and your ability to opt out of this type of advertising on your browser by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs, please visit: </p><li>if you are based in the USA, the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and/or the <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2⟨=EN">DAA’s consumer choice tool</a>;</li><li>if you are based in Canada, the DAAC’s</li><p></p><a href="https://youradchoices.ca/choices/">consumer opt-out tool</a><li>if you are based in Europe, the EDAA’s <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu">Your Online Choices</a>; or</li><li>if you are based elsewhere, any equivalent website that might be run by a local body that co-ordinates online advertising choices.</li><p>To learn more about interest-based advertising in mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices tool, please download the version of AppChoices for your device <a href="https://youradchoices.com/appchoices">here</a>.</p><p>To opt out of interest-based advertising in your apps, you may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. For example, most device operating systems (e.g. iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of tailored in-app advertisements. You can review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more about those features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements.</p><p>Please note if you opt out through the self-regulatory programs above, this will only apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select. You will continue to receive advertising, but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests. If you use a different device or browser or delete your cookies, you may need to renew your opt-out choice or, where consent is required for cookies, to opt in.</p><p><strong>Precise location information</strong>. To disable the collection of precise location information from your mobile device through our mobile apps, you can access your mobile device settings and choose to limit that collection.</p><p>Please also see the next section, Cookies and other technologies, for more choices about managing other technical and usage information.</p><h3>COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES</h3><p><strong>How we use cookies and other technologies</strong>. We use cookies, web beacons and/or similar technologies to understand and enhance your online experience at our sites and through our advertising and media across the internet, including social media sites and mobile apps as further described below. Our affiliates, as well as our and their advertising partners and other third-party service providers, also use such technologies for this purpose.</p><p>Cookies are small text files placed in your browser.

This means that the retention periods will vary according to the type of personal information and the reason that we have the personal information in the first place. For example, some personal information related to the provision of services to you or by you will be kept for a number of years in order to comply with various finance and tax-related legal obligations. Other service-related personal information may be kept for a different period because it is in our legitimate interests to do so in order to provide or receive an appropriate follow-up service.</p><p>After a retention period has elapsed, the personal information is securely deleted. We may, however, retain copies of your information in anonymised form, which we may use or disclose at our discretion, such as to help us improve our sites and products.</p><p>We have put in place reasonable controls (including physical, technological and administrative measures) designed to help safeguard the personal information that we collect via the sites. No security measures are perfect, however, and so we cannot assure you that personal information that we collect will never be accessed or used in an unauthorised way, which may happen due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control. We have put in place procedures to deal with a suspected personal data breach, and we shall notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p><h3>YOUR PERSONAL DATA RIGHTS</h3><p><strong>Your legal rights</strong>. Under certain circumstances, you may have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information (which may be limited to personal data):</p><li>right of access to your personal information;</li><li>right to rectification of your personal information;</li><li>right to erasure of your personal information;</li><li>right to restriction of processing of your personal information;</li><li>right to portability of your personal information;</li><li>right to object to processing of your personal information;</li><li>right not to be subject to significant automated decision-making (including when based on profiling); and/or</li><li>right to withdraw consent to processing of your personal information.</li><p>Some of those rights may only apply to you if you are resident in the EEA or a country with similar data protection laws. To find out more about those specific rights, please see the last paragraph of this section and the ICO’s website (<a href="https://www.ico.org.uk">www.ico.org.uk</a>).</p><p>Exercising your rights. If you wish to exercise any of those rights, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@wizardingworld.com">privacy@wizardingworld.com</a>.</p><p><strong>Your legal rights in more detail (for UK and other EEA residents)</strong>. In certain circumstances, you have the following legal rights in relation to your personal information (to the extent consisting of “personal data” in the EEA and countries with similar data protection laws, and so we use that term in the rest of this section). We may ask you for additional information, so that we take reasonable steps to check that – for example – we only provide personal data to the person to whom the data relate.</p><li><strong>Right of access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing such data.</li><li><strong>Right of rectification</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data that you provide to us.</li><li><strong>Right to erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that we may retain your data in certain circumstances in accordance with law, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. </li><li><strong>Right to restriction</strong> of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you would like us to establish the accuracy of such data; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li><li><strong>Right to portability</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. If you so request, we shall provide you, or a third party that you have chosen, with a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to automated information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform our contract with you.</li><li><strong>Right to object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground, in which case we will consider whether we have compelling reasons to continue to process your data.</li><li><strong>Right to object to direct marketing</strong>. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for purposes of direct marketing. Please see the section above Your marketing and advertising choices for how to exercise the right.</li><li><strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong> at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products, content or services to you.</li><li><strong>Right to complain in the UK or elsewhere in the EEA</strong>. If you would like to complain, please contact us using the details below. This does not override your right to complain to the relevant supervisory authority at any time.</li><h3>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h3><p>In various countries, local data protection laws treat individuals under a certain age (“<strong>Relevant Age</strong>”) as children whose personal information requires additional protection under such laws. For example, the Relevant Age for the purposes of obtaining valid consent from individuals to collect their personal information by online means is 13 in the US and UK.</p><p>For any given country in which site users are based: (a) we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the Relevant Age; and (b) if we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a site user under the Relevant Age, we will delete such information from our records.</p><p>If you believe your child has provided us with personal information without your authorisation and you would like to have the personal information deleted, please contact us as described below.</p><h3>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h3><p>Wizarding World Digital LLC is a company located in the USA, and therefore when you use our sites and services, Wizarding World Digital LLC collects or receives your data in the USA. This means that personal information we collect will be processed by us or on our behalf in the USA, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the EEA.</p><p>If you are located in the UK or elsewhere in the EEA or if Wizarding World Digital Limited has collected your information, then, when we transfer your information to our affiliates outside the EEA, we make use of standard contractual clauses that have been approved by the European Commission for data transfers. We also use those clauses when we transfer your information to third parties outside the EEA, or we may adopt other means to ensure that adequate safeguards are applied to your information (such as the EU-US Privacy Shield or binding corporate rules). You can obtain further information on the methods that we use to protect your information when it is transferred outside the EEA by contacting us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@wizardingworld.com">privacy@wizardingworld.com</a>.</p><p>### CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</p><p>From time to time, we may make changes to this policy. We will notify you about such changes by placing a notice on our sites and/or sending an email to you. We encourage you to check back and review this policy periodically so that you always know our current privacy practices.</p><p>### CONTACT US</p><p>Wizarding World Digital LLC, a limited liability company registered in the United States, and Wizarding World Digital Limited, a private company limited by shares registered in England and Wales, jointly control how your information is used. We work together to make decisions about use of information and to respond to queries, or to respond to requests to exercise personal data rights.</p><p>In respect of UK or other EEA-located users, Wizarding World Digital Limited has been appointed as the representative in the EEA of Wizarding World Digital LLC.</p><p>If you have any questions about this policy, you can contact our data privacy team:</p><li>by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@wizardingworld.com">privacy@wizardingworld.com</a>; or</li><li>by post (marked for the attention of the Wizarding World Digital Data Privacy Team) at:</li><li>Warner Bros. Privacy Office, 4000 Warner Blvd., Bldg. 3, Burbank, CA 91522, USA; or</li><li>Warner House, 98 Theobalds Road, London WC1X 8WB, UK.</li><h3>AFFILIATES</h3><p>Our affiliates are: </p><li>Warner Bros.
