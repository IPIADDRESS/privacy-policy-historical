  Thank you for visiting a SeaWaves Technology ("we"  or "us") Web site. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect  your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information  practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use of the  personal information you submit on Web pages where this policy is posted.</p>
<p>  As we operate internationally, and many of our computer  systems are currently based in the United States, your personal data will be  processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may  not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as  the European Union. If you create a user account with this site as a visitor  from outside the United States, you will be asked during the initial  registration to consent to the collection and/or processing in the United  States of your personally identifiable information, which includes the use of  cookies as described below.</p>
<p><strong>The Information We  Collect</strong><br>
  At some SeaWaves Technology Web sites, you can order  products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion,  subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate  in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally  identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name,  address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information,  and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs,  and services.</p>
<p>  At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who  provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able  to order products, programs, and services, or otherwise participate in the  site’s activities and offerings. We also collect certain non-personally  identifiable information when you visit many of our Web pages such as the type  of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of  operating system you are using (e.g., Windows 2000 or Mac OS), and the domain  name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).
</p>
<p><strong>How We Use The  Information</strong><br>
  We use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill  your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries  about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that  we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>  We use this information to communicate with you, such as to  notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our  subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or  to contact you about your account with us.</p>
<p>  We use the information that you provide about others to  enable us to send them your gifts or cards. From time to time, we also may use  this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.</p>
<p>  The information we collect in connection with our online  forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use  this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and  communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or  services.</p>
<p> If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a  "letter to our editors"), we may publish your screen name and other  information you have provided to us. We use the non-personally identifiable  information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and  to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this  information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you  products, programs, or services.</p>
<p> We may disclose personally identifiable information in  response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a  subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law  enforcement agency’s request or where we believe it is necessary to  investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected  fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any  person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. In  addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged  with another company.<br>
  Agents and contractors of SeaWaves Technology Web sites who  have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this  information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for  example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the  services they are performing for SeaWaves Technology Web sites.</p>
<p> Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against  unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally  identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner  that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p> At some places on our Site, we may ask your permission to  disclose personally identifiable information about you to companies whose  practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., other marketers,  magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases and non-profit  organizations) that want to market products or services to you. If at some  point you grant us permission to transfer your information for these purposes  and later decide that you no longer want us to do so, simply send us an email  at info@sea-waves.com<script type="text/javascript">

  Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose  information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the  other sites’ privacy policies, as we have no control over information that is  submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
<p> We sometimes may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes,  or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third  parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain  personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to  participate in the site activity.

<p>  <strong>Cookies and Other  Technical Information</strong><br>
  We send "cookies" to your computer primarily to  enhance your online experience. "Cookies" are files that can identify  you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as  technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies  can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete  them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). We may  also use "Web beacons" that monitor your use of our sites. Web  beacons (or Web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for  delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data,  such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the  page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the  page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web  beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the  identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that  server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, Web beacons let us  know whether you received and opened our e-mail.</p>
<p>  If you choose to furnish the site with personally  identifiable information, this information can be stored in or linked to other  data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.</p>
<p> By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to  our use of cookies and Web beacons as described herein. You may adjust your  browser to reject cookies from us or from any other Web site. Additionally, by  setting your Web browser to display HTML e-mails as text only, you may be able  to prevent the use of some Web beacons. Please consult the "Help"  section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of our  sites can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and  you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you  from accessing some of our content.</p>

<p>  <strong>Children’s Privacy</strong><br>
  Visitors to this site may participate in many activities  without providing any personally identifiable information. However, if a user  wants to participate in certain of our interactive features, we ask the user to  register and provide us with the following information: the user’s e-mail  address and age information. When the person who registers indicates that he or  she is under 13, we will either collect no personally identifiable information  from that individual or inform the child that a parent’s verifiable consent is  required or we will collect the e-mail address of the user’s parent in addition  to the user’s e-mail address. We use the parent’s e-mail address to seek the  parent’s verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her child’s online  activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her child from a newsletter  or other similar activity. If a user is under 13, we will not condition his/her  participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more information than  is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. We do not share  children’s information with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy  Policy. If you would like to review any personally identifiable information  that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted,  and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child’s  information or if you have questions about these information practices, you may  contact us at info@sea-waves.net.<script type="text/javascript">

<p><strong>Cookies &amp; 3rd Party Advertisements</strong><br>
