<p><b>Last Updated: February 2003
</b>
</p><p>PopMatters.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of
Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized
experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (e.g., your
name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the
terms of this privacy policy. Please note this policy applies only to
information collected by PopMatters.com online and does not impact
information collected or used by PopMatters.com or its affiliates through
other means. 

</p><p><b>How we gather information from users. </b>
<br>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,
the activities in which you elect to participate and the services
provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you
register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain
features, such as newsletters, news updates and other products, or when
you make a purchase, such as a newspaper subscription. You may provide
information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, voting and
polling activities, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive
areas of our site. 

</p><p>Like most Web sites, PopMatters.com also collects information
automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be
transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your
Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and
hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store
your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that
information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you
encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt
additional technology, we may also gather information through other means.
In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for
example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do
you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked
to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to
customize the site's features according to your preferences. 
What we do with the information we collect. 

</p><p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit
and deliver more individualized content and advertising, and we sometimes
permit our advertising and promotional partners to call to your attention
products, special offers and unique content we believe might be of
interest to you. We offer you the opportunity to elect not to receive
direct communications sent by our advertisers or promotional partners, as
described below. 

</p><p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)
may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about
your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to
help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited
most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may
occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again,
this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information
about you or allow anyone to identify you individually. 

</p><p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on PopMatters.com
to communicate with you about your registration and customization
preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and
products offered by PopMatters Media, Inc., and other PopMatters Media
affiliates and partners; and other topics we think you might find of
interest. 

</p><p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by PopMatters.com may also
be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site
administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with
you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation
of our site (our Web hosting service and our newsletter provider, for
example) may access such information. We will use your information only as
permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop
our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or
businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the
transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a
court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to
do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to
us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate
or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to
disclosure in such cases. 

</p><p><b>Your choice to opt out. </b>
<br>From time to time our advertising and promotional partners may use
Personally Identifiable Information to call to your attention products and
offers they believe might interest you. If you prefer not to receive
direct communications sent by our advertisers or promotional partners, you
will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide us information
we might use for this purpose. If you decline at the time you provide us
with such information, you will not receive e-mail or other communications
sent directly by our advertisers using information collected from our
site, though we may on occasion send you information on their behalf. 
Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements. 

</p><p>PopMatters.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect
the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including
our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers
accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data
collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our
site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a PopMatters.com page,
certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also,
through PopMatters.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access,
information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other
parties. PopMatters.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of
such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of
those third parties when providing information on a feature or page
operated by a third party. 
</p><p>
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third
parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of
your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of
our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that
enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular
advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer
services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology
to gather information. PopMatters.com does not control the use of this
technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not
responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. 
You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that
information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third
parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from
other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control
of PopMatters.com and this policy. 

</p><p><b>Children. </b>
<br>PopMatters.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally
Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as
permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a
child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that
information immediately. If you believe PopMatters.com has any information
from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed
below.

</p><p><b>Changes to this policy. </b>
<br>PopMatters.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time.
Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our
site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept
those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is
posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the
time the information was collected. 

</p></font><p><font face="georgia," times="" size="-1"><b>Governing law. </b>

court as the most convenient and appropriate forum for the resolution of
disputes concerning this policy. PopMatters.com is controlled, operated
and administered entirely within the United States. This statement and the
policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any
contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
