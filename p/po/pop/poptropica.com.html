<p>We encourage our visitors to read through and understand our privacy statement. We may update it from time to time to address new issues or reflect changes on our Website. Please refer to this privacy statement regularly. SAM reserves the right to revise this privacy statement at any time and such revisions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof. Notice may be given by any means including, but not limited to, posting the revised privacy statement on this Website. Any use of our site by you subsequent to such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by you of such revision.</p>

<p>For material changes to this privacy statement that may affect the collection or use of personal information from children under the age of 13, we will notify and obtain the prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian.

<p><strong><u>Children's Privacy</u></strong></p>

<p>SAM encourages parents and guardians to supervise their child's use of the Internet. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information without a parent's or guardian's permission when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. For this reason, SAM generally does not request, collect, or store any personal information knowingly from children under 13.</p>

<p>As a parent, you've probably done a lot of thinking about protecting your family's privacy on the Internet. We have been thinking and working hard to provide you with the best information and the highest quality interaction on the Internet in an environment that is safe. In compliance with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), we have adopted the following policies to keep kids safe (there are exceptions to these policies as noted below under the heading "Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent and Information Collected from Children"):</p>

<ul><li>We will NOT knowingly collect, use, or distribute personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.</li>
	<li>Personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by SAM or its agents for internal purposes only and will NOT be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties.</li>
	<li>We will NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 access to free form chat, message boards, email accounts, or other services within SAM that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personal information without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.</li>
	<li>We will NOT knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.</li>
	<li>We will NOT knowingly keep any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Any such information will be purged promptly after the issue has been resolved.</li>
	<li>We will NOT knowingly post any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Upon notice to us, these submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter.</li>
	<li>We will NOT knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens.</li>
	<li>We will advise children under the age of 13 that they MUST obtain permission from their parent or guardian before sharing ANY personal information.</li>
	<li>Upon request, SAM will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process for a program or service of this site. SAM only asks for a child's or teen's personal information if it is necessary to participate in an activity, game or service. If we have collected and stored personal information from a child, we will give parents the ability to review their child's personal information, request that we discontinue further collection or use of their child's personal information, and/or request that we delete their child's personal information.</li>
</ul><p><strong><u>Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent:</u></strong></p>

<p>Before any personal information is collected from a child under the age of 13, we will use reasonable efforts to notify the parent or guardian that their child is participating. Notification will include the exact nature and intended use of the information we are collecting, as well as the opportunity for the parent or guardian to prevent the use of the information and the child's participation in the activity. For every child under the age of 13, we will also require the parent or guardian to provide verifiable parental consent such as: by email plus a fax, phone or letter follow up by the parent or guardian; mail, fax or scan of a consent form; or toll-free phone call to SAM; or other acceptable method.</p>

<p>In order for us to provide notice to a parent or guardian and seek verifiable parental consent, we may request the online contact information of a parent or guardian.</p>

<p><strong><u>Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent and Information Collected From Children:</u></strong></p>

<p>In the following instances we will NOT get verifiable parental consent for the collection of a child's personal information:</p>

<ul><li>Collecting a child's contact information solely to directly respond to the child's request on a one-time basis (for example, to provide assistance with a particular customer service question). We will not use that information to re-contact the child for any other purpose (we will purge from our system the child's personal information after responding);</li>
	<li>Collecting a child's contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to directly respond more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription). In this instance, the parent or guardian will be notified that the child made such a request and be informed of the information provided by the child. The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child's request (i.e., unsubscribe). We will not use the child's personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose.</li>
	<li>Using persistent identifiers on our Website to support the internal operations of our Website which include: maintaining and analyzing the functioning of the Website; performing network communications; authenticating users; personalizing content on the Website; serving contextual advertising or capping the frequency of advertising; protecting the security or integrity of the user, Website or service; and to ensure legal and regulatory compliance. A "persistent identifier" is a series of numbers that we assign to a user but cannot be reasonably used to identify a specific user.</li>
	<li>A child may provide the email address of their parent or guardian for the purpose of retrieving or resetting a child's lost password for their user account.</li>
</ul><p><strong><u>About Our Advertisers:</u></strong></p>

<p>This Website allows advertising by third parties. SAM does not control the linking practices of advertisers or sponsors and does not monitor or claim responsibility for any content or privacy practices of such websites. Once you have clicked on an advertisement and have left this Website, you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or sponsor to see how your information will be handled.</p>

<p>SAM may offer contests, sweepstakes, and promotions that are sponsored by third-party advertisers or sponsors. These third parties may obtain personal information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the activity. SAM does not control the third parties' use of information.</p>

<p>SAM may use advertising servers developed by third parties to display ads on this Website. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors) and may use anonymized information (not including your name, address, email address, telephone number) about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they transmit. The SAM privacy statement does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you. Please note that SAM does not engage in the practice of showing or tracking users for interest-based advertisements on its child-directed sites.</p>

<p>For more information on ad serving, please go to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ad-serving/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ad-serving/</a> . If you would like to know your choices about not having information used by these third parties, please go to:<br><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options">http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options</a> .</p>

<p><strong><u>A Notice About External Links</u></strong></p>

<p>Occasionally, you will find links from SAM to independently owned, controlled, and/or managed Websites whose content we believe will be of possible interest and value to our visitors. Additionally, you'll see links from advertisers, sponsors, and other partners who may use a SAM owned logo as part of a co-branding agreement.</p>

<p>In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. We do not control the content of these links. These other sites may send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our Websites, we do not control these cookies or the content of these third parties.</p>

<p>SAM has partnered with other companies to provide certain services. In some cases, you may see a SAM owned logo on another company's site. SAM does not share any of your personal information with these partners and they do not share any information with us.</p>

<p>Once you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information collected from you is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you cannot find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from that site's Home page, you should contact the site directly for more information.</p>

<p>We specifically recommend that children check with their parents, guardians, or teachers before connecting to any third party sites.</p>

<p><strong><u>Security</u></strong></p>

<p>SAM has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Essentially, we encrypt all transmission of sensitive data and secure all of our repositories of data. The data transferred to our third party payment processors when you use your credit card to make a purchase transaction with us will be transferred using our encrypted technology to safeguard your personal information and privacy. However, you should understand that "perfect security" cannot be guaranteed.</p>
