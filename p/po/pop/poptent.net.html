		<h3>Personal Information</h3>

Certain other portions may require additional codes. The information that You provide to Poptent during the Poptent member registration or renewal process, including without limitation the information listed below, together with any additional information You provide to Poptent and information regarding the manner in which You use Your Poptent membership is Personal Information, will not be processed or disclosed by Poptent except as permitted by this Policy or as required or allowed by applicable law or legal process.

		<h3>Accuracy of Personal Information</h3>
		<p>

		<h3>Protection of Personal Information</h3>
		<p>
			Poptent endeavors to protect the security of Personal Information collected on the Site from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The Site uses an encrypted connection when transferring sensitive Personal Information. Poptent also has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure the information Poptent collects online in accordance with industry standards. When Poptent contracts with third parties to perform any services supporting the Site, Poptent will require that the third parties protect the security of the Personal Information collected with comparable security standards. 
		</p>

			Neither passwords nor security systems are foolproof or necessarily work as intended, including encryption, and people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Although Poptent takes what we believe are commercially reasonable security precautions, Poptent does not guaranty security. You agree to do what You reasonably can to help promote security (e.g., never reveal your password or make it accessible to others).

			If You or any other person believes they are a victim of identity theft entitled by law to request information from Poptent, write Poptent at Poptent' contact address in principle 4 below and also provide all required information. Poptent will supply without charge the information legally required to be disclosed that Poptent then has, subject to applicable law and reserving all of our rights and defenses.
