<p>This Privacy statement ('Privacy Policy') covers the website http://www.popjam.com,
owned and operated by PopJam Ltd. ('PopJam', 'we', 'us', 'our'). PopJam knows that you
care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy
seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the
PopJam website, submitting information or using any of our products or services, you are
accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 the data controller is PopJam Ltd. of 53
Greek Street, Soho, London W1D 3DR.</p>

<h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers PopJam's treatment of personal information that PopJam
gathers when you are on the PopJam website and when you use PopJam services. Also,
this Privacy Policy covers PopJam's treatment of any personal information that PopJam's
business partners share with PopJam. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of
third parties that PopJam does not own or control, or to individuals that PopJam does not
employ or manage.</p>

<h2>What Personal Information Does PopJam Collect?</h2>

<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to personalize and improve our
services. We collect the following types of information from you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong><br>
    <p>We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or
provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with
certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many
of our special features.</p>
    <p>Registration: In order for you to use our website fully, you must complete a
registration form. As part of this registration form, we require your email
address, name, and username.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Automatic Information:</strong><br>
    <p>We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact
with us. PopJam may automatically receive and record certain 'traffic data' on
our server logs from your browser including your IP address, PopJam cookie
information, and the page you requested.</p>
    <p>Generally, our services may automatically collect usage information, such
as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our website and its components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>E-mail Communications:</strong><br>
    <p>If you contact us by email we may keep record of that communication.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong><br>
    <p>For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may
receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account
information.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>What about Cookies?</h2>

<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer's hard
drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser
and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many
people.</p>

<p>The 'help' portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how
to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser
to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We
strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because
cookies enable you to take advantage of some of PopJam's most attractive
features.</p>

<p>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example,
advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>

<h2>Uses Made of Your information</h2>

<p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To ensure that content from our website is presented in the most effective
manner for you and for your computer.</li>
  <li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from
us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be
contacted for such purposes.</li>
  <li>To carry out our obligations from any contracts entered into between you
and us.</li>
  <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you
choose to do so.</li>
  <li>To notify you about changes to our service.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>We may share your data with selected business partners for the purposes listed above,
but we shall not rent or sell your personal data to third parties.</p>

<p>We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to advertisers or business
partners, but we may provide them with anonymized aggregate information about our
users. We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers and business
partners reach the kind of audience they want to target.</p>

<h2>Will PopJam Share Any of the Information it Receives?</h2>

<p>We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your personal
information only with your consent or to the business partners and affiliates as described
below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Personnel:</strong><br>
<p>Our personnel (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consultants and/or
contractors) may have access to user information while carrying out their duties in
the normal course of our company business.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Agents:</strong><br>
<p>We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and
need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you.
Examples include sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from our
database, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer
service. You hereby consent to our sharing of your personal information for the
above purposes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Business Transfers:</strong><br>
<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of
transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is
transferred. Moreover, if PopJam, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired,
customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by
a third party.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Protection of PopJam and Others:</strong><br>
<p>We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is
necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other
agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of PopJam, our employees,
our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other
companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Where We Store Your Information</h2>
<p>The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination
outside the European Economic Area ('EEA'). It may also be processed by staff operating
outside the EEA, who work for us or for one of our suppliers. By submitting your personal
information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps
necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this
privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Is Information About Me Secure?</h2>
<p>Your PopJam account information is protected by a password for your privacy and
security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password
and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.
Only PopJam employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for
example, a customer service representative) are granted access to that personal
information. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security
practices.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee 
the security of your personal information transmitted to our website; any transmission is
at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures
and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<h2>What Information Can I Access?</h2>

<p>You can access your personal information on our website and correct, amend, or delete
information that is inaccurate by updating your profile under the 'Account' section of the
website.</p>

<h2>What Choices Do I Have?</h2>

<p>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, but then you may be
unable to use certain features on our website.</p>

<p>You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the
'What Personal Information Does PopJam Collect?' section above. When you update
information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.</p>

<p>You may request deletion of your PopJam account by sending an email to
account [at] popjam [dotcom]. Please note that some information may remain in our records
after deletion of your account.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please update your profile under
the 'Account' section of the website. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal
notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of
the PopJam website, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</p>

<h2>Can Children Use PopJam's Services?</h2>

<p>You must be at least 18 years old to register to use the PopJam website. As a result,
PopJam does not specifically collect information about children.</p>

<h2>Conditions of Use</h2>

<p>If you decide to visit the PopJam website, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy
is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages,
and application of the laws of England &amp; Wales.</p>

<h2>Third Party Websites</h2>

<p>PopJam services may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other
websites may contain links to the PopJam website. These other websites are not under
PopJam control. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the
PopJam website are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and PopJam is not responsible for
the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>PopJam may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole discretion. Use of
information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
information is used. We recommend that you periodically check the site for changes, so you 
are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances if any, it is disclosed.</p>

<h2>Questions or Concerns</h2>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy at the PopJam website, please
send a detailed message to privacy [at] popjam [dotcom]. Your privacy is important to us and
we will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
