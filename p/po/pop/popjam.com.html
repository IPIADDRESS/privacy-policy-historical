        <h2>1. Who are you and what is this Privacy Policy about?</h2>
<p>Mind Candy Ltd is a UK family entertainment company that creates extraordinary brands with online games at their heart. &nbsp;We know that you care about how your Personal Information is used and shared and we care about that too.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy tells you how we look after, use and share the Personal Information that we collect from you. Please read this carefully. Unless we tell you or you agree, we do not share your Personal Information with anyone.</p>
<p>When you use any of our Services, you are agreeing to our Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>2. How do you protect my Personal Information?</h2>
<p>We are serious about guarding the security of your Personal Information and use a secure server to store your Personal Information. However, like everyone else, we cannot guarantee complete security. We use industry standard organisational and technical security measures to protect your data against unauthorised disclosure or processing. We have certified that we adhere to a legal framework established by the United States Department of Commerce called ‘Safe Harbor’, relating to the collection, use and retention of personal information from the European Union.&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">Safe Harbor</a>.</p>
<p>Where you are required to choose a password for your account, you are responsible for keeping that password confidential. This means you should limit access to your computer or device and sign off after you have finished accessing your account. If you think someone has access to your password or unauthorised access to your account, please inform us immediately at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@mindcandy.com">info@mindcandy.com</a>.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for the misuse of your account or information where you have not kept your password confidential or not reported a breach of security.</p>
<h2>3. What information do you collect about me?</h2>
<p>We collect Personal Information about you when you register with us, use our Services, answer our questions or provide feedback. We may also record our communications with you.</p>
<p><b>Information that you provide to us</b>: This may include your name, email address, telephone number, address book, user name, date of birth, genderand your location. If you buy something from us, we may need your address and payment information. &nbsp;You may choose whether or not to give some information to us. However, not providing certain information may mean you cannot enjoy all or parts of our Services.</p>
<p><b>Information that is automatically collected:</b>&nbsp;Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically record information from your browser or device. This may include your IP address, device information (e.g., MAC address, device type), pages you have requested and cookie information.&nbsp; Depending on your privacy settings, we may also receive information from social networks you choose to connect with via our Services, e.g. your profile information from Facebook.</p>
<h2>4. How will you use the information about me?</h2>
<p>We use the information you give to us to make our Services the best possible experience for you. For instance, we may use your information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customise the Services you choose to receive</li>
<li>Manage your account and your queries</li>
<li>Improve our Services</li>
<li>Contact you with important service announcements</li>
<li>Meet our legal and regulatory obligations and protect our legitimate interests</li>
<li>Carry out research and analysis, training and quality assurance</li>
<li>If you agree, contact you about other Services and products from Mind Candy that we think may be of interest to you</li>
<li>if you agree, contact you with advertising from other businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of our Services may use location information transmitted from your devices. We only use location information in a way that is necessary to provide the Service you want. If you have not allowed your location information to be sent (through the settings menu on your device), then location information will not be sent.</p>
<h2>5. To whom will you disclose my Personal Information?</h2>
<p>Mind Candy will not share your Personal Information for marketing purposes with companies outside the Mind Candy group of companies, unless you have given us permission to do so. However, we may share your information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may display your chosen profile information along with your activity levels on our Services, to friends with whom you have connected. Your other Personal Information cannot be seen by other users unless you post it in areas accessible by other users</li>
<li>We may share your Personal Information, where appropriate, with any member of our group of companies</li>
<li>We work with trusted partners to perform tasks on our behalf and we may need to disclose your Personal Information for them to provide services to you. However, these companies are bound by confidentiality obligations and do not have any independent right to use your Personal Information beyond what is necessary to assist us</li>
<li>When the law requires us to disclose your information, we will comply</li>
<li>When we need to enforce our Terms of Service, investigate fraud, reduce credit risk, exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims</li>
<li>When it is necessary for the protection of a person’s wellbeing or property and when obtaining your prior consent is difficult</li>
<li>If there is a change in the ownership of Mind Candy or any of its assets, we may disclose Personal Information to the new or prospective investor. If we do so, we will notify you before your Personal Information becomes subject to a different privacy policy</li>
</ul>
<p>Mind Candy may display targeted advertisements based on anonymised information, personally identifiable information or information you make publicly available. No Personal Information will be provided to the advertiser directly by Mind Candy when you interact with or view a targeted advertisement. However, by interacting with or viewing an advertisement you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will collect data from you and/or make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advertisement.</p>

<p>We would like to send you information about our Services which may be of interest to you. If you don’t like this, we are happy to stop at any time.
