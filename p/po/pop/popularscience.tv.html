        <p>To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our privacy practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by Bonnier.</p>
        <p>Bonnier adheres to the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor framework and the privacy principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access, and Enforcement.&nbsp; For more information on the framework, please visit the&nbsp;Safe Harbor website.</p>

            Privacy Department<br>
            Bonnier Corporation<br>
            460 N. Orlando Avenue, Suite 200<br>
            Winter Park, FL 32789
        </p>
        <p><b>An overview of the information that Bonnier may collect</b></p>
        <p>You are able to take advantage of many&nbsp;Bonnier&nbsp;products, services, and websites without providing any information that personally identifies you.&nbsp; We only collect personally-identifying information when you voluntarily submit it to us.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, we need personally-identifying information in order to provide you with the products and services that you request.&nbsp; Depending upon the product or service, we may ask you for a variety of personally-identifying information.&nbsp; This might include, for example, your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, gender, and&nbsp;birth date.&nbsp; We may also ask for other information about you, such as your credit card information (when you are making a purchase), interests, income, or education level. &nbsp;We consider certain identifying information “sensitive.”&nbsp; This includes your credit card number, income level, or any other information that would normally be considered confidential.</p>
        <p>You may choose not to provide us with any personally-identifying information.&nbsp; In that case, you can still access and use many portions of&nbsp;our&nbsp;websites; however, you will not be able to access and use those portions of any&nbsp;Bonnier&nbsp;website that require your personal information.</p>
        <p>Many Bonnier websites include community features, such as online forums and message boards.&nbsp; Information that is posted in these areas becomes public information and the use that any third party makes of this information is beyond our ability to control.&nbsp; You should exercise caution before disclosing any personally-identifying information in these public venues.&nbsp; If you elect to submit content that includes information that can be used to identify you, you must assume that the content can and will be displayed on any website on the Internet.</p>
        <p>At some&nbsp;Bonnier&nbsp;sites and through certain promotions, you can submit personally-identifying information about other people.&nbsp; For example, you might submit a person’s name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card; or, if you order a gift online or offline and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient’s name and address.&nbsp; Some Bonnier websites also provide referral services to help you inform a friend about our websites, products, or services.&nbsp; The types of personally-identifying information that we collect about other people at pages like these may include the person’s name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number.&nbsp; We will only ask you for the information about your friend that we need in order to do what you request.</p>
        <p>In some circumstances, we also collect non-personally-identifying information.&nbsp; When you visit a&nbsp;Bonnier&nbsp;website, we may collect information such as the type of browser you use, your operating system, your IP address, and the domain name of your Internet Service Provider.&nbsp; This information, by itself, does not permit individual identification, meaning that you will remain anonymous.&nbsp; However, if you elect to provide us with personally-identifying information during your visit, that information may be linked to your IP address.</p>
        <p>When you visit our websites, we may send one or more cookies ¿ small, removable data files ¿ to your computer.&nbsp; We use cookies to uniquely identify your browser, which allows us to enhance and personalize your online experience at&nbsp;Bonnier&nbsp;websites.&nbsp; For example, cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to a website and present relevant content to you when you visit.&nbsp; Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to warn you when cookies are sent, or to refuse all cookies.&nbsp; Some of the features and services of&nbsp;Bonnier websites may not operate properly if your cookies are disabled.&nbsp; Cookies, by themselves, do not provide us with any personally-identifying information.</p>
        <p>On our websites, we may also use tiny graphic images called pixel tags, web beacons, or clear gifs.&nbsp; These tiny images help us to analyze our users’ online behavior and collect other data, such as page views or advertising responses.&nbsp; Pixel tags also allow us to send you e-mail in a format that you can read, and let us know when you have opened an e-mail message from us.&nbsp; Pixel tags may also be used to deliver cookies.&nbsp; Some of our websites also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit. These companies may use non-personally-identifying information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>
        <p>We work with reputable third parties that provide data tracking and collection technologies in order to:</p>
        <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Present or serve the advertisements you may see at Bonnier websites;</p>
        <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deliver and track e-mail communications;</p>
        <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Process purchase orders through e-commerce transactions;</p>
        <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fulfill print and digital subscription orders; and</p>
        <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide marketing leads to third-party organizations (where you have agreed to allow us to do so).</p>
        <p>These companies may collect information about you on our behalf.&nbsp; We require that these parties agree to process any such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
        <p>We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third-party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit&nbsp;networkadvertising.org.</p>
        <p>Bonnier websites sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties.&nbsp; By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally-identifying information that visitors voluntarily submit to them in order to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion.&nbsp; Bonnier has no control over the third-party sponsors’ use of this information.&nbsp; If a third-party sponsor beyond our control will obtain information that you supply us, we will notify you at the time we collect the information from you.&nbsp; For certain promotions, only those who provide us with the requested personally-identifying information will be able to order products, programs, and services, or otherwise participate in the promotion’s activities and offerings.</p>
        <p>Some of our websites contain links to other sites.&nbsp; By clicking on these links, you will leave the website operated by Bonnier and this Privacy Policy will no longer apply.&nbsp; These other sites’ information practices may be different than ours.&nbsp; You should consult the other sites’ privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
        <p><b>How we use the information we collect</b></p>
        <p>We use the personally-identifying information that you provide us to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about offerings, and to offer you other products, programs, or services that we believe may be of interest to you.&nbsp; We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests, when&nbsp;we make changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.</p>
        <p>We may syndicate the publicly available content of our community areas to unaffiliated third-party websites, using RSS or other technologies.&nbsp; The information you have shared in the community areas may be included in this syndication.</p>
        <p>We will use the personally-identifying information that you provide about others in order to provide the products or services that you have requested; for example, to enable us to send them your gifts or cards.&nbsp; If you provide us someone else’s personally-identifying information for referral purposes, we may use that information to invite them to visit our websites or to provide them information about our products or services.</p>
        <p>If you provide us with your e-mail and/or postal address, we may include that address in e-mail and/or postal address lists that we sell, trade, or rent to third parties.&nbsp; These lists will never contain sensitive information.&nbsp; If you do not wish for your e-mail or postal address to be shared with companies not owned by Bonnier who want to market products or services to you, you have the opportunity to opt out, as described below.&nbsp; You may also opt out of the receipt of any marketing materials from Bonnier as described below.</p>
        <p>We may transfer your sensitive personally-identifying information to other&nbsp;Bonnier&nbsp;offices for internal management and administrative purposes.&nbsp; In addition, your personal data will be transferred to other&nbsp;Bonnier&nbsp;offices where necessary for the performance or conclusion of our contractual obligations to you or for your benefit.&nbsp; Transfers of personally-identifying information may also be made where necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
        <p>Bonnier will only share your sensitive personal information with outside companies or individuals in any of the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we use trusted businesses or persons to process personal information on our behalf.&nbsp; Before sharing any personal information with outside parties, we require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
        <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal process; (b) enforce the applicable Terms of Service or other agreements and policies on the Company’s Websites; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety or Bonnier, its users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
        <p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you consent.&nbsp; Before we share your sensitive personal information outside of the previously listed circumstances, we will ask you for permission first.&nbsp; Please note that this only applies to sensitive information, as defined above.</p>
        <p>We may also use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users for any legal purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.&nbsp; In no event will this aggregated data contain any information that could be used to identify individual users of our products or services.</p>
        <p><b>How we protect the safety and integrity of the information we collect</b></p>
        <p>We take appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural measures to safeguard and protect your personal information.&nbsp; We use a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication, to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information.&nbsp; We store your personal information on systems behind firewalls that are only accessible to a limited number of persons, each of whom is required to keep the information confidential.&nbsp; We also take appropriate measures to secure the transmission of sensitive personal information from your computer to the Company’s computers.&nbsp; When you transmit sensitive personal information to us, like credit card information, we offer the use of a secure connection to our servers.&nbsp; To the extent you select the secure connection method or your browser supports such functionality, all credit card account information that you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.&nbsp; Regardless of these measures, no system connected to the Internet or data transmission sent over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; We will provide notice if we become aware of any security breach that may affect any sensitive personal information pertaining to you that we have stored on our systems.</p>
        <p>Bonnier&nbsp;employees, agents, and contractors who have access to personally-identifying information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and may not use the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Bonnier.&nbsp; These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
        <p>Bonnier only collects personal information that is relevant to the purposes for which it will be used.&nbsp; Though we do take appropriate steps to review and update the information that we store to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and current, we also depend on you to update or correct your personal information when necessary.</p>

        <p>In some limited circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our policies, we may retain some of information that you have requested us to remove.&nbsp; Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.</p>
        <p>We only use the information we collect for purposes consistent with this policy.&nbsp; If we propose to use your personal information for purposes beyond that explained in this policy, we will provide appropriate notice before doing so and we will provide you with the means to opt out of those uses.&nbsp; We will not use your sensitive personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy unless we have obtained your consent.</p>
