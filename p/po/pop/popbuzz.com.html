<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>Personal Information</b></font>
<br>
 ApexMail.Net has access to information about members from the registration form and from
  upgrades to the Professional service.</p>
<p>From the site's registration form, we obtain the user's name and e-mail address. This information is used for system administration and for contacting the user when necessary. Contact is made for reasons relating to customer support, account upgrades, new feature announcements, virus alerts, and maintenance disruptions to the mail service.</p>
<!-- <P>Demographic information (such as telephone area code, zip/postal code, age group, gender etc.) is used to deliver targeted
  advertisements. Our advertisers submit advertisements to us and specify the intended
  audience; ApexMail.Net then displays the advertisements to users
  who meet the advertiser's criteria. </p>-->
<p>From time to time, selected and consenting users may be asked to complete online
  surveys, either relating to customer service or on behalf of advertisers. Demographic
  information collected by surveys may be shared with advertisers, but on an aggregate basis
  only. </p>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>Financial Information</b></font>

<br>Financial information that is collected for Professional upgrades is used to bill the user for products and services only. We share financial information with third party intermediaries (credit card companies and banks) when processing credit card payments; these intermediaries do not store, retain or use the information we give them. During upgrades, members have the choice of sending their credit card information through a secure server or a non-secure server. Information submitted through the secure server is encrypted for protection.</p>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>Updating Personal Information</b></font>

<br>Members can correct or update their personal information at any time by contacting us via e-mail or by telephone.</p>
<center><table border="0">
<tbody><tr>
<td>E-mail:<br>
Telephone:</td>
<td><b><a href="mailto:support@apexmail.com">support@apexmail.com</a></b><br>
604-852-1591
 </td></tr>
</tbody></table></center>
<p>Member accounts are closed after ninety days of account inactivity, at which point personal information is erased from the system. </p>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>IP Addresses</b></font>
  <br>We collect IP addresses for system administration and to share aggregate
  information with our advertisers. The originator's account name and IP address are
  inserted onto the header of a message when it is transmitted in or out of the system; this
  information is used to track the source of a message in cases of system abuse. </p>
  <p>

</p><p><font color="#cc0000"><b>Children</b></font>

<br>Users must be 13 years of age or older to open an ApexMail account. If ApexMail learns that a user under 13 is publicly posting or sharing personally identifiable information, it will protect the child by closing the account in question and by deleting any personal information we may have inadvertently collected from the child.</p>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>Partner Sites</b></font>

<br>Members who sign up for e-mail through one of our co-branded partner sites have the same privacy protection as ApexMail members. The personal and Professional upgrade information gathered from these members is collected by ApexMail, and not by our co-branded partners. We do not share any personally identifiable information with our partners.</p>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>Banner Advertising</b></font>

<br>This site, ApexMail, uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data about your visit to this and other web sites, typically by using cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, follow this URL: 
<a href="http://www.engage.com/privacy">http://www.engage.com/privacy</a>.</p>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>Cookies</b></font>
<br>Cookies are currently used by ApexMail only for our own statistical purposes, to aid us in the areas of site design, feature upgrades, service troubleshooting etc.; however, the functionality of the mail service is not affected in any way if the user's browser is configured to reject cookies. Cookies may also be used by third parties that provide value-added services to subscribers of the upgrade service; in this case, cookies are used to store user name and password for smooth integration between the mail service and the value-added service.</p>
<p>Advertisements appearing on our site may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner advertisements are collected by our advertising company (see above); we do not have access to this information, nor are we responsible for it.</p>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>Security</b></font>

<br>We have security procedures in place to protect the member information we collect from loss, misuse or alteration. All member information is password-protected and limited to authorized personnel only. Our personnel are made aware of the privacy practices of the site through our in-house privacy policy, which is circulated to all employees twice yearly. Web security is reviewed once a month.</p>
<p>When our upgrade order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open when you are just 'surfing'.</p>

<!-- <p><font color="#cc0000"><b>Tell a Friend Service</b></FONT>

 <br>ApexMail.Net operates the <B>Tell a Friend</B> link on this Web site. We collect the full name  and e-mail address of the person who initiates the message so that we can display this information to the recipients of the message. Friends' e-mail addresses submitted by the sender are used only to transmit the message to them. We do not use any of the information we collect through the <B>Tell a Friend</B> link for secondary purposes. Friends will not receive any further communication from us after the initial e-mail is sent. The <B>Tell a Friend</B> information is hosted on a server owned by ApexMail; the client sharing the server, however, does not have access to the information.</P> -->

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>Links to Other Sites</b></font> 

<br>This Web site contains links to other sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are going to another Web site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites, as their privacy policy may differ from ours.</p>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>Legal Issues</b></font>

  <br>ApexMail.Net will not disclose any personally identifiable information,
  such as e-mail address, name, phone number or postal address, without prior consent of the user;
  however, such information will be divulged if the law requires it, or to protect the
  rights or property of ApexMail.Net. The company will only disclose member
  information on an aggregate basis and under confidentiality agreements with partners,
  advertisers and third parties. </p>

<p><font color="#cc0000"><b>Changes to Privacy Practices</b></font>

  <br>Members will be notified by e-mail in the event that ApexMail.Net changes its privacy practices. Any questions about the privacy policy, the practices of
  this site, or dealings with this site may be directed to our <a href="#coord"><b>privacy coordinator</b></a>.</p>
