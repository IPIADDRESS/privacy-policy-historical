Last updated: January 2009<br><br>

PopCap Games, Inc. is committed to making our website a fun place to visit. We know that you care how information about you is used and shared.  And if you're worried about your privacy - or 

the security of our site - it's hard to have a good time! That's why we work hard to protect your rights.<br><br>

Please read the following Privacy Policy to understand how we use any information we may collect from you. The Privacy Policy is current as of the effective date set forth above.  We reserve the 

right to change this policy from time to time, so be sure to check back periodically.  If the changes we make to our Privacy Policy are significant, we will notify you on our website that our 

Privacy Policy has been revised.<br><br>
This Privacy Policy applies to PopCap.com and all websites owned or controlled by PopCap Games, Inc., including the majority of websites operated by subsidiaries or affiliates owned or controlled 

by PopCap Games, Inc. (the "Sites").  It does not apply to those websites owned or operated by subsidiaries and affiliates of PopCap Games, Inc. who display their own privacy policy.  PopCap Games 

Inc. and its owned or controlled subsidiaries and affiliates to which this Privacy Policy applies may be collectively referred to herein as "PopCap", "we", or "our", as the context requires. 

<br><br>
By visiting any of the Sites, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into PopCap’s <a href="http://www.popcap.com/terms.php">Terms of Service</a>.</p>


<h2>1. What Personal Information About You Does PopCap Gather? </h2>
          <div class="divider" width="100%"></div>
<p> The information PopCap collects from you helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at our Sites. Here are the types of information we gather: 
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Purchase Related Information:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on our website or that you provide to us when you enter promotions or sweepstakes or use 

our products or services. Some information, such as a valid email address or credit card billing information, may be necessary to purchase a game, subscribe to a newsletter or one of our services, 

access particular features, or otherwise transact business with us.  You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We 

may also occasionally ask you to voluntarily provide information, such as your opinions about games or your demographics none of which is required to access our products and services.  As detailed 

more fully below, we use the information that you provide for such purposes as verifying your right to access products and services, billing, responding to your requests, customer service 

inquiries, customizing your experience at our Sites, improving our online stores, improving our products and services, and communicating with you. </li> <br>

<li><strong>Information About Other People:</strong> On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift certificate online and want it sent 

directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's name and email address. We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to send the gift 

certificate and this information may be shared with companies or agents who perform this function on our behalf. We do not otherwise share this information with outside parties.</li><br>
 
<li><strong><em>Information We Collect Automatically:</em></strong> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, we automatically send and receive 

information to and from your computer which we use to automatically update (new features, bug fixes, etc.) our products and services that you have downloaded.  Like many websites, we also use 

"cookies," and other automated tools to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our Sites, and through other online interactions.  Though such information will typically 

be used in an aggregated way to improve our products and services, some information may be used to personalize your experience, or to offer you products and services specifically based on your 

preferences and usage.</li><br>
   
<li><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong> To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from our Sites if your computer 

supports such capabilities. We may also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers, and to comply with 

best practices and applicable legal authority. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please visit <a href="http://www.popcap.com/unsubscribe.php">http://www.popcap.com/unsubscribe.php</a> or send a written request to the 

following address:</li>

<h2>2. What About Cookies? </h2>
<div class="divider" width="100%"></div>

<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies on our Sites.  Some cookies allow us to 

make it easier for you to navigate our Sites, while other cookies provide features such as such as storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.<br><br>

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to 

disable cookies altogether. However, having cookies enabled allows you to take full advantage of some of our Sites’ coolest features.
</p>


<h2>3. Member Accounts, Passwords, and Invitations </h2>
<div class="divider" width="100%"></div>

<p>Your password is unique to your PopCap account and is designed to protect your account from unauthorized use. PopCap is not responsible for any lost, stolen, or otherwise disclosed passwords. 

Additionally, PopCap will not replace or reinstate any game credits or other awards that are generated or redeemed by unauthorized password activity. You are responsible for keeping the 

confidentiality of your Account Information and password. PopCap representatives will never ask you for your password.</p>


<h2>4. How Does PopCap Use Information it Receives? </h2>
<div class="divider" width="100%"></div>

<p>PopCap uses the information we gather for the following purposes:  
</p><ul>
<li>To provide our products and services to you, to bill you for premium products and services, to communicate with you concerning your account, and for other customer service, authorization, 

account history and billing purposes.  This may include credit card authorization and verification, free trial access, location verification for products and services which may have limited 

geographical access, and the like.  </li><br>
<li>To improve our software and services by providing personalized experiences and recommendations, language and location customization, personalized help and instructions, or other responses to 

your and other customers’ usage of our products and services.</li><br>
<li>To track purchases and usage as necessary for the purpose of our making royalty or other payments to third parties.  However, your personally identifiable information will not be transferred to 

such third parties unless you have been notified in advance and given an opportunity to opt out or cancel.  </li><br>
<li>To offer you upgrades, updates, content, services, games or other products and services.</li><br>
<li>To ask you to participate in surveys about products and services.</li><br>
<li>To provide you with news and newsletters, special offers, promotions, and targeted advertising.</li><br>
<li>To better understand how users access and use our products and services, including our Sites and advertising, on an aggregated and individualized basis, for the purposes of improving our 

products and services, and to respond to customer desires and preferences.</li><br>
</ul>
<p></p>


<h2>5. When and How Does PopCap Share Information It Receives? </h2>
<div class="divider" width="100%"></div>

<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as compatible with the purposes 

described above, when we have your permission or as described in this section.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PopCap Subsidiaries:</strong> We may share your information with subsidiaries and affiliates that we own or control but only if those entities are either subject to this Privacy Policy 

or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.</li><br>

<li><strong>Contractors and Agents:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal 

mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance (including data concerning marketing and promotional programs), providing search 

results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, providing customer service or for other purposes within the ordinary course of business.  These third parties 

have access to personal information needed to perform their functions on our behalf.  We require these companies to agree (1) to provide adequate protections for your personal information that are 

no less protective than those set out in this Privacy Policy and (2) to use your personal information only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by us.  We are not liable for 

the acts or omissions of these third parties, except as provided by applicable law.</li>
 
<li><strong>Promotional Offers; Third Party Advertising; Third Party Sites:</strong>
We may send offers to PopCap customers on behalf of other businesses and/or include promotions of third party products and services (with links to third party websites). When we do this, we do not 

give that business your personal information.<br><br>
If you do not want to receive such offers, please contact PopCap at <a href="http://www.popcap.com/unsubscribe.php">http://www.popcap.com/unsubscribe.php
</a>.  If you respond to such an offer, or if you click on a link that takes you to a third party’s website, you may, at some point, be required to provide personal information to the other 

business.  If so, you will have an opportunity to review that other entity’s privacy policy and decide for yourself whether or not to do business with them.  Similarly, third parties that advertise 

on our site may collect information from you when you navigate away from our site by clicking on another site link or third-party logo.<br><br>
While we strive to do business only with other reputable entities, we cannot be responsible for how a third party collects or handles personal information obtained directly from you.  We believe 

our Sites and services are designed in such as way as to make clear when you have left a PopCap page or service and are interacting with another entity.  Each such third party entity’s use of your 

information is governed by its own privacy policy and/or terms of service. </li><br>

<li><strong>Jointly Offered Products and Services:</strong> From time to time we may offer products or services jointly with another entity, or may offer an additional product or service from 

another entity that in some way enhances or is related to a PopCap product or service.  Examples include jointly developed or licensed games, another entity’s online service that is based upon a 

PopCap game, or products or services that may enhance your gaming or computing experience.  In such cases, PopCap’s use of your personal information is governed by this Privacy Policy, and the 

other entity’s use of your personal information is governed by that entity’s own privacy policy and/or terms of service.  </li><br>

<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy online stores, subsidiaries, or other businesses.  In such transactions, customer information 

generally would be one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in 

the event that PopCap, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, we will provide notice before customer information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li><br>

<li><strong>Protection of PopCap and Others:</strong> We reserve the right to disclose your personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, judicial proceeding, 

court order or other legal process; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of PopCap, our employees, our users, or others. This 

includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction purposes. This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise 

disclosing personal information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>


<h2>6. How Secure Is Information About Me? </h2>
<div class="divider" width="100%"></div>
<ul>
<li>We take commercially reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</li><br>
<li>We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.</li><br>
<li>We will not reveal or store more than the last four digits of your credit card number when you place an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit 

card company during order processing.</li><br>
<li>Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security all of the time.</li><br>
<li>Any information we collect will be securely processed, stored and archived in databases and backups that could reside in either the United States and/or Ireland. </li><br>
<li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.  We strongly recommend that you 

implement measures to protect your computer from unauthorized access such as firewall protection and anti-virus software.</li>
</ul>




          
<h2>7. Can I Access My Personal Information? </h2>
<div class="divider" width="100%"></div>

<p>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect and store is reliable, accurate, complete and current.<br><br>

You may access the personal information you have provided us, except where the burden or expense of providing access to you is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or where the rights of 

others may also be violated. To access your information, please send a written request to:
