<a name="1"></a><b>Our Commitment To Privacy</b>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide
this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can
make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice
easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every page on our site.</p>
<p><a name="2"></a><b>The Information We Collect:</b></p>
<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Planet Earth Projects, Inc. website. 
On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and
register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at
these pages are:
</p><ul>
  Name<br>
  Address<br>
  Email address<br>
  Phone number<br>
  Credit/Debit Card Information<br>
  Information about your objectives<br>
  Information about the tools you are using
</ul>


<p><a name="3"></a><b>The Way We Use Information:</b></p>
<p>We use the information you provide about yourself when making a request only
to attempt to fulfill that request. We do not share this information with outside parties
except to the extent necessary to complete that order. (For example, if you request a document
be mailed to you, we will reveal your address to the Postal Service or other carrier who will
deliver that document.)</p>
<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses
are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
</p><p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website
and to serve our customers.</p>
<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information
provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also
providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated
uses.</p>
<p><a name="4"></a><b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b></p>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we
collect online.</p>
<p><a name="5"></a><b>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</b></p>
<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that
reason, and because we are a business-oriented website not designed for 
individuals under the age of 13, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we
actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract
anyone under 13.</p>
<p><a name="7"></a><b>How To Contact Us</b>
</p><p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies,
please call us at 203-746-4019 or send us an email at privacy@p-e-p.com.
