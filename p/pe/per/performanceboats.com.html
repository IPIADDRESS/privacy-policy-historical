<p>We use the information you provide about someone else when  placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery.  We  do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent  necessary to complete that order. </p>
<p>We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product  you order for another person.  Information you provide to us to create a  gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to  the person receiving the gift. </p>

<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better  design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may  tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area  on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out  our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be  used to identify those individuals. </p>
<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable  information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones  described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or  otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. </p>
