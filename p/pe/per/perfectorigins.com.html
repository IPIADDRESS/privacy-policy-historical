    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Effective Date: May, 2014</p>
    <p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on 
      the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to 
      use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with 
      complete confidence.</p>
    <p>The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection 
      practices of PERFECTORIGINS.COM. ("we" or "us"). Specifically, 
      it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you 
      are using the PerfectOrigins.com website (the "Site"), and the 
      ways in which we use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our 
      children's privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may 
      provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means 
      (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).</p>
    <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, 
      you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed 
      by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need 
      to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case 
      we'll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and update 
      the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By 
      continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the 
      Privacy Policy as modified.</p>
    <p><b>How We Collect and Use Information</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily 
      supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in 
      responding via email to a feature provided on the Site). PerfectOrigins.com 
      only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the 
      event that they have signed up to receive our messaging, attended one of 
      our events, or have purchased one of our products. PerfectOrigins.com collects 
      personally identifying information from our users during online registration 
      and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes name and e-mail 
      address for registration or opt-in purposes and name, postal address, and 
      credit card information when registering for our events or purchasing our 
      products. All of this information is provided to us by you.</p>
    <p>We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as 
      you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect information 
      about your computer's connection to the Internet, which allows us, among 
      other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure 
      traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser 
      software called a "cookie" to enhance your experience with the 
      Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard 
      drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use 
      the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique 
      users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you 
      from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where 
      you may have entered preference information before. The Site also may use 
      web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent 
      GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open 
      HTML-formatted email messages.</p>
    <p>We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site 
      in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features; 
      advertising that appear on the Site; and, making other offers available 
      to you via email, direct mail or otherwise. We also may provide your information 
      to third parties, such as service providers contractors and third-party 
      publishers and advertisers for a variety of purposes. Unless you inform 
      us in accordance with the process described below, we reserve the right 
      to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information collected 
      from and about you while you are using the Site in any way and for any purpose, 
      such as to enable us or a third party to provide you with information about 
      products and services. If you do not wish your information to be used for 
      these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator 
      whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to 
      be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes 
      or that may be given or sold to third-parties.</p>
    <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information 
      available for viewing by third parties online - for example on message boards, 
      web logs, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be seen, 
      collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any 
      unauthorized third-party use of such information.</p>
    <p>Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present 
      advertising on the Site also may collect information from you via cookies, 
      web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party advertisers and ad 
      servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, 
      to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for other 
      purposes. The use and collection of your information by these third-party 
      advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party's privacy 
      policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies 
      of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. 
      If you have any concerns about a third party's use of cookies or web beacons 
      or use of your information, you should visit that party's website and review 
      its privacy policy.</p>
    <p>The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to products 
      and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not 
      control. When you access another website or purchase third-party products 
      or services through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed 
      by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the 
      provider of such products or services.</p>
    <p>We may also make some content, products and services available through 
      our Site or by emailing messages to you through cooperative relationships 
      with third-party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear 
      on the Site in connection with such content, products and/or services. We 
      may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that 
      is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available 
      in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner 
      may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy 
      of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner's use of your 
      information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from 
      ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our 
      provider partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for 
      more information.</p>
    <p>Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors 
      when release is appropriate to comply with law or to protect the rights, 
      property or safety of users of the Site or the public.</p>
    <p>Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various 
      assets. In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or 
      one or more of our websites is acquired by another company, information 
      about our users may be among the transferred assets.</p>
    <p><b>Children's Privacy Statement</b></p>
    <p>This children's privacy statement explains our practices with respect to 
      the online collection and use of personal information from children under 
      the age of thirteen, and provides important information regarding their 
      rights under federal law with respect to such information.<br>
    </p>


<p>This Site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do NOT 
  knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the 
  age of thirteen as part of the Site. We screen users who wish to provide personal 
  information in order to prevent users under the age of thirteen from providing 
  such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally 
  identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the 
  Site, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices 
  in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting 
  any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen 
  as part of the Site.</p>
<p>Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children 
  under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we also do NOT knowingly distribute 
  such information to third parties. We do NOT knowingly allow children under 
  the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable 
  contact information through the Site. </p>
<p>Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children 
  under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we do NOT condition the participation 
  of a child under thirteen in the Site's online activities on providing personally 
  identifiable information. </p>
