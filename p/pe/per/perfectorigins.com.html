    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      
    <p>PRIVACY POLICY</p>
    <p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on 
      the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to 
      use the Internet’s vast array of information, tools, and opportunities 
      with complete confidence.</p>
    <p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment 
      to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects 
      information from all end users of our Internet services (the “Services”)-those 
      who access some of our Services but do not have accounts (“Visitors”) 
      as well as those who may purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service 
      fee to subscribe to the Service (“Members”)-what we do with the 
      information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning 
      the collection and use of such information. We request that you read this 
      Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
    <p>Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</p>
    <p>Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors 
      and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network 
      of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily 
      to provide a customized experience as you use our Products and Services, 
      and generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, 
      we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your 
      permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we 
      believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described 
      below.</p>
    <p>Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information 
      when they sign up for our Products or Services including name, address, 
      telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and 
      the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal 
      information collected from Members during the registration process is used 
      to manage each Member’s account (such as for billing purposes). This 
      information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated 
      otherwise or in special circumstances.</p>
    <p>However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our 
      Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, such 
      as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services 
      as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and 
      the partner to assess the results of the promotion.</p>
    <p>In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for 
      any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles 
      from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the 
      total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail 
      below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell 
      advertisements that appear on the Services.</p>
    <p>Our Company Partners and Sponsors: Some products and services may be offered 
      to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor 
      seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of 
      these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain 
      personal information. In these instances, you will be notified before any 
      such data is collected or transferred and may decide not to use that particular 
      service or feature.</p>
    <p>Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or co-branded Web Pages 
      that are cosponsored by an affiliate, independent contractor seller, or 
      non-affiliated partner. Our company may share non-identifying and aggregate 
      information (except as described above), but not personal information, with 
      such partners in order to administer the co-branded products or services 
      offered.</p>
    <p>Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services 
      or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product 
      and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact 
      information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and 
      credit/debit card information.</p>
    <p>If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order 
      sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about 
      the recipient, such as the recipient’s name, address, and phone number. 
      Our company has no control over the third parties’ use of any personal 
      information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care 
      when doing so.</p>
    <p>If you order services or products directly from our company we will use 
      the personal information you provide only to process that order. We do not 
      share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary 
      to complete that order.</p>
    <p>Online Advertisements: Our company may display our online advertisements. 
      In those cases we share aggregated and non-identifying information about 
      our Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well 
      as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers.</p>
    <p>Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying 
      information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, 
      an advertiser or joint venture company tells us the audience they want to 
      reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon 
      the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may 
      then display or send the advertisement to the intended audience. Our company 
      does not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these 
      advertisers or joint venture companies.</p>
    <p>Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email inquiries 
      to our company, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry 
      we receive. Our company does not use the return email address for any other 
      purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.</p>
    <p>Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically conduct both business and 
      individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in 
      these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps 
      us to improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide 
      them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly 
      confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation 
      in our customer surveys is voluntary.</p>
    <p>We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our 
      Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other 
      customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey 
      questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, 
      industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated 
      information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop 
      new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information 
      may be shared with third parties.</p>
    <p>Promotions: Our company may offer polls, contests, sweepstakes, drawings, 
      games, content, or other promotions that are sponsored by or cobranded with 
      third parties. In certain instances, company may have to supply personally 
      identifiable information of the winners to the third parties. Our company 
      has no control over third parties’ use of this information.</p>
    <p>You may be entered in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, simply 
      by making a purchase from us or by providing us with personally identifiable 
      information for some other reason or purpose. When the winning entries are 
      chosen, only the names and personally identifiable information of the winners 
      are shared with the entity administering the sweepstakes or contest, so 
      that they can notify the winners.</p>
    <p>Special Cases: It is our company’s policy not to use or share the 
      personal information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the 
      ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out 
      or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
    <p>However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, 
      or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible 
      through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe 
      that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies, collection agencies, 
      merchant database agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as 
      the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, 
      regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to 
      disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal 
      action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or 
      Terms Of Service, or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; 
      or to protect our company and our Members.</p>
