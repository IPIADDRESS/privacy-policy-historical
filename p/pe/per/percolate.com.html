                    <p>This Privacy Policy describes Percolate Industries, Inc. (“Percolate”)’s policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information. Percolate receives your information through our various web sites, APIs, services and third-parties (“Services”). When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used by Percolate in the United States or any other country where Percolate operates.</p>

                    <h3>Information Collection and Use (Notice and Data Integrity)</h3>

                    <p>Information Collected on the Website: We may collect the following personal information from you: name, email address, phone number when you send requests on the website. We may also collect physical address when you sign up for our affiliate membership and demographic information such as gender, veteran status, disability status when you send job applications through the website.</p>

                    <p>Information Collected Upon Registration: When you create or reconfigure a Percolate account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, email address, and authentication to 3rd party platforms like Twitter and Google Reader. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, will appear publicly on our Services when you share content on another site, such as Facebook or Twitter, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration (during the alpha phase they do).</p>

                    <p>Additional Information: You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography or a picture. You may customize your account with information such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages or your address book so that we can help you find Percolate users you know. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>

                    <p>Posts, Following, Sources and other Public Information: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide to us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the posts you create and the metadata provided with these posts, such as when you posted, the people you follow, the sources you have in our system, and many other bits of information. When you share information on a third party site, the privacy settings you set through that site will remain unless you change them. The fact that you shared information on a third party site will be publicly viewable on Percolate. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public but we generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want. Keep in mind that if your privacy settings on a third party site are set to public, then your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For example, your public posts are searchable by many search engines and are immediately delivered via our APIs to a wide range of users and services. You should be careful about all information that will be made public by Percolate, not just your posts.</p>

                    <p>Log Data: Our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”) created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements, may also be included in Log Data.</p>

                    <p>Links: Percolate may keep track of how you interact with links in posts across our Services including third party sites by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>

                    <p>Cookies: Like many websites, we and our partners use “cookie” technology to collect additional website usage data (such as cookies or similar technologies) to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk. Percolate may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>

                    <p>Third Party Services: Percolate uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.</p>

                    <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure (Onward Transfer)</h3>

                    <p>Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party web client to access your Percolate account.</p>

                    <p>Service Providers: We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.</p>

                    <p>Law and Harm: In certain situations, Percolate may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Percolate’s rights or property.</p>

                    <p>Business Transfers: In the event that Percolate is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>

                    <p>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public posts or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).</p>

                    <p>We may share your information with third-party business partners, for instance, for the purpose of enhancing our products and services or so that they can market their products or services to you. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@percolate.com">privacy@percolate.com</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Our Policy Towards Children</h3>

                    <p>Our Services are not directed to people under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@percolate.com">privacy@percolate.com</a>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account.</p>

                    <h3>Modifying Your Personal Information (Access)</h3>

                    <p>Upon request Percolate will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. To request this information please contact us at privacy@percolate.com.</p>

                    <p>You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@percolate.com">privacy@percolate.com</a>. We will respond to these requests within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

                    <p>We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>

                    <p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.</p>

                    <p>California Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.

                    <h3>Security</h3>

                    <p>We have implemented security measures to protect user information from loss, misuse and alteration. We use industry-standard practices such as encrypted storage, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. Each of our employees is aware of our security policies, and your information is only available to those employees who need it to perform their jobs.</p>

                    <h3>Disclosures Specific to Our Service/Platform</h3>

                    <p>Percolate collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the client that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Percolate’s Client (the data controller). If the Client requests Percolate to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days.</p>

                    <p>We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. We will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

                    <h3>Disclosures Specific to Percolate’s Mobile Applications</h3>

                    <p>When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or “UDID”). We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or Services.</p>

                    <p>We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.</p>

                    <p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.</p>

                    <h3>EU Data Privacy Statement</h3>

                    <p>We process user information in our facilities in the United States. All user information subject to this Privacy Policy is collected in the United States, obtained through websites in the United States, or obtained in other countries and transferred to the United States. Regardless where it originated, all user information subject to this Privacy Policy receives the same level of privacy protection as described herein.</p>

                    <p>We handle personal information that is subject to EU data protection laws in accordance with the seven principles outlined in EU Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data (the “Safe Harbor Principles”). Additional information about the Safe Harbor program is available at the U.S. Department of Commerce’s website at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>EU Personal Data Protection After Safe Harbor Invalidation.</strong> In October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-US Safe Harbor program as the basis for the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area. In order to continue providing services to our global client base, we are working to develop ways for our clients to continue transferring personal data to us in compliance with EU data protection laws. When necessary, we implement EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) (pre-approved by the European Commission and also referred to as the Model Clauses), through our Data Processing Addendum. Furthermore, on February 2, 2016, the US and the European Union announced their agreement to a new framework for personal data transfer, referred to as the EU-US Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield framework has not yet been implemented, but we will continue to monitor developments related to the Privacy Shield and work with clients to ensure that their transfer of personal data is compliant with EU data protection laws.</p>

                    <h3>Privacy Shield</h3>

                    <p>Percolate and its subsidiary company Percolate Industries Ltd. participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Percolate is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list">U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List</a>.</p>

                    <p>Percolate is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Percolate complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>

                    <p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Percolate is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. FTC.
