		<p>Date of Last Revision:  July 17, 2008</p>
		<p>Thank you for visiting our website (the "Website"). Perfect World  Entertainment, Inc. ("Perfect World") operates this Website and  maintains this Privacy Policy ("Policy") that summarizes when and how  your personal information is collected, used, safeguarded and disclosed  in connection with your use of the Website. We reserve the right to  change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you  that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the  date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from  time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal  information you provide will be used.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="privacy_policy">       
		<h4>What is personal information?</h4>
		<p>As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that  specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address,  telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other account  number), and information about that individual's location or  activities, such as information about his or her use of the Website,  when directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal  information also includes demographic information such as date of  birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is  linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal  information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we  collect about the use of the Website or about a group or category of  products, services or users, from which individual identities or other  personal information has been removed. Aggregate data helps us  understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider  new features or otherwise tailor our Website. This policy in no way  restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="privacy_policy">
		<h4>What personal information do we collect?</h4>	
		<p><strong>• Active Collection</strong></p>
		<p>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you  visit our Site. For example, we may collect your name, address, email  address, user name and other contact and demographic information when  you register and set up an account, apply for a job, or contact us by  e-mail or other means for any reason. When you make a purchase, we may  also collect your credit card or other payment or billing information.  Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you  provide such information in connection with creating a profile or  group, leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message  to another user or participating in any interactive chat rooms, forums  or features on the site. In addition, from time to time we may collect  demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in  connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests,  games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site. You can  access certain portion of our Website without providing us with any  personal information. However, you will not be able to utilize certain  features that require registration or receive materials unless certain  information is provided. From time to time we may change the  information requested upon registration or with respect to certain  features or services, so this may not be a complete list.</p>
		<p><strong>• Log Files</strong></p>
		<p>When you use the Site, some information is also automatically  collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating  system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and your  activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal information  if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information  mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>
		<p><strong>• Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
		<p>We may automatically collect certain information through the use of  "cookies" or clear gifs. Cookies are small data files that are stored  on a user's hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the site  to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain  information such as customer preferences and history. If we combine  cookies with or link them to any of the personally identifying  information, we would treat this information as personal information.  Clear gifs (also know as web bugs or web beacons) are small, invisible  graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to  the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on  the Site. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please  refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn about these  functions. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a  user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and the Service may  not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and  may not be able to access certain Site features or services.</p>
		<p>We may also use third parties to serve ads on our Website. These third  parties may place cookies, clear gifs or other devices on your computer  to collect information, and information provided by these devices may  be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your  interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our  Website and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This policy  does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies in third  party ads or for compliance with such third parties' privacy policies  or data collection practices.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="privacy_policy">
		<h4>Do we use personal information?</h4>	
		<p>In general, we use personal information we collect to process your  requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services  you request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions,  products or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate  your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Site, to  better understand the needs of our visitors, and for the purpose for  which the information was provided. For example, we may use the  information we collect:</p>
		<ul>

			<li>to respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints;</li>
			<li>to analyze user characteristics and usage patterns in order to better understand how our products and service are used and    market them more effectively;</li>

		<h4>Do we share personal information?</h4>	
		<p>Unless otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy, we generally do  not disclose, sell or trade any personal information about our visitors  and users to any third parties.</p>
		<p>We may share personal information with vendors, consultants and other  service providers (“Service Providers”) who are engaged by or working  with us in connection with the operation of the Site or the Services  and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us.  In some cases, the Service Provider may be directly collecting the  information from you on our behalf. We inform Service Providers that  they are not permitted to use personal information they obtain from us  other than to provide the services for us. However, we are not  responsible for the actions of Service Providers, nor are we  responsible for any additional information you provide directly to  these Service Providers and we encourage you to become familiar with  their practices before disclosing any personal information directly to  such Service Providers.</p>
		<p>We may also share personal information with third parties when you give  us your consent to do so. For example, we may enter into relationships  with other parties to make specific services or offers available  directly to our users. If a user opts in to these third party services  or marketing offers, we may share the personal information you provide  at the time of sign-up or such other personal information, such as your  name or other contact information, that we deem reasonably necessary or  appropriate for our business partner to provide these services or  offers or get in contact with you.</p>
		<p>We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we  are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is  reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with  legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the  rights, property or safety of Perfect World, our users, our employees  or the public, including without limitation to protect Perfect World or  our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of  our Site. Information we collect, including personal information, may  also be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of,  any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition or in any  other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of  the business assets of Perfect World.</p>
		<p>You understand that when you use the community features of our Website,  information you post in public or private groups, forums, and other  interactive areas of the Site, as well as any information you share  with individuals through the Website, will be available to other users  and in some cases (such as when you post to a public area of the Site)  may be publicly available. We recommend you be cautious in giving out  personal information to others or sharing such information in public or  private online forums. We are not responsible for the actions of any  third parties with whom you share personal information.</p>
		<p>Please note that nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregate  information, which may be shared with third parties without your  consent.</p>

		<p>In addition, we restrict internal access to personal information to  employees who need the information to perform their duties.
