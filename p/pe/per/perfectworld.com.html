Date of Last Revision:  July 17, 2008<br>
<br>
Thank you for visiting our website (the "Website"). Perfect World Entertainment, Inc. ("Perfect World") operates this Website and 
maintains this Privacy Policy ("Policy") that summarizes when and how your personal information is collected, used, safeguarded and 
disclosed in connection with your use of the Website.  We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time.  
We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the date it was last updated.  We encourage you to 
review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.<br>


<div class="p_privacyHeader"> <img src="/modules/policy/images/header_privacy2.gif"> </div>
As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, 
telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other account number), and information about that individual's location or activities, 
such as information about his or her use of the Website, when directly linked to personally identifiable information.  Personal 
information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information 
is linked to other personal information that identifies you.  Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is 
data we collect about the use of the Website or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual 
identities or other personal information has been removed. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that 
we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Website.  This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and 
use of aggregate information.<br>


<div class="p_privacyHeader"> <img src="/modules/policy/images/header_privacy3.gif"> </div>
<h3>Active Collection</h3>
Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Site.   For example, we may collect your name, address, 
email address, user name and other contact and demographic information when you register and set up an account, apply for a job, or 
contact us by e-mail or other means for any reason.  When you make a purchase, we may also collect your credit card or other payment 
or billing information.  Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with 
creating a profile or group, leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user or participating in any 
interactive chat rooms, forums or features on the site.  In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other 
personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, 
and other activities on the Site.  You can access certain portion of our Website without providing us with any personal information.  
However, you will not be able to utilize certain features that require registration or receive materials unless certain information is 
provided. From time to time we may change the information requested upon registration or with respect to certain features or services, 
so this may not be a complete list. <br>
<h3>Log Files</h3>
When you use the Site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating 
system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal 
information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the 
aggregate only.<br>
<h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
We may automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" or clear gifs.  Cookies are small data files that are 
stored on a user's hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited them and 
retain certain information such as customer preferences and history.  If we combine cookies with or link them to any of the personally 
identifying information, we would treat this information as personal information.  Clear gifs (also know as web bugs or web beacons) 
are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and 
monitor user activity on the Site. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or 
help screen to learn about these functions.  However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some 
portions of the Site and the Service may not function properly.  For example, you may not be able to sign in and may not be able to 
access certain Site features or services. <br>
<br>
We may also use third parties to serve ads on our Website.  These third parties may place cookies, clear gifs or other devices on 
your computer to collect information, and information provided by these devices may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising 
targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Website and the other sites tracked by these third 
parties.  This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies in third party ads or for compliance with such third 
parties' privacy policies or data collection practices.<br>


<div class="p_privacyHeader"> <img src="/modules/policy/images/header_privacy4.gif"> </div>

you request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to 
facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Site, to better understand the needs of our visitors, and for the

We may share personal information with vendors, consultants and other service providers (“Service Providers”) who are engaged by or

these Service Providers and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing any personal information directly

party services or marketing offers, we may share the personal information you provide at the time of sign-up or such other personal 
information, such as your name or other contact information, that we deem reasonably necessary or appropriate for our business partner 
to provide these services or offers or get in contact with you.  <br>

is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to 
protect the rights, property or safety of Perfect World, our users, our employees or the public, including without limitation to 
protect Perfect World or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Site.  Information we collect, 
including personal information, may also be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of
