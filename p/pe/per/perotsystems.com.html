      <p> <strong>GENERAL</strong></p>
      <p> Perot Systems and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "Perot 
        Systems") are committed to privacy and data protection and have no 
        desire or intent to infringe on your privacy rights. This Perot Systems 
        Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") is intended to tell 
        you about the type of information that is collected on this web site ("Site") 
        and how such information is used.<br>
        By using our Site, you consent to the collection, use and storage of your 
        information by Perot Systems in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. 
        If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you should cease use of 
        this Site immediately.</p>
      <p> <strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</strong></p>
      <p> In general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or 
        revealing any personal information about yourself. However, you may choose 
        to give us personal information, such as your name, address, telephone 
        number, or email address that may be needed, for example, to correspond 
        with you, to allow you to participate in features offered by this Site, 
        to provide you with a subscription or newsletter or to transmit your resume 
        for possible employment opportunities. If at any time you wish to have 
        your name removed from a mailing list, subscription or other direct mailing 
        you may receive from us, send us an email at <a href="mailto:Privacy.Officer@ps.net">Privacy.Officer@ps.net</a> 
        and we will remove your name promptly.</p>
      <p> This Site may automatically collect certain information such as the 
        Internet address of the domains from which users visit us and may analyze 
        this data for trends and statistics. Also, when you access this Site, 
        we may store information on your computer in the form of a "cookie" 
        or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of text stored on your computer 
        that may, for example, help us know which browser you are using and where 
        you have been on our Site. A cookie may also tell us which pages are being 
        viewed and which are not. This information helps us to improve the Site. 
        Our Site does not require visitors to accept cookies, although some features 
        of the Site may not be available to users who do not accept cookies. Most 
        Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change 
        your browser to block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie 
        is stored and you can erase cookies from your computer.</p>
      <p> Unless otherwise disclosed herein or during the collection, personally 
        identifiable information that may be collected from visitors to this Site 
        is retained by Perot Systems. Perot Systems does not sell or transfer 
        personal information collected on this Site to outside parties except 
        to agents or contractors of Perot Systems for business-related purposes 
        in connection with services of this Site or of Perot Systems. We may disclose 
        aggregate statistics using information collected on our Site, but such 
        statistics will include no personally identifiable information. Resumes 
        and related information submitted on this Site by applicants for employment 
        may be distributed to Perot Systems and its agents and affiliates' offices 
        worldwide for recruiting or other employment-related purposes. Notwithstanding 
        the foregoing, Perot Systems may release information when we believe that 
        such release is necessary to (i) comply with applicable law or governmental 
        authorities, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our agreements 
        or (iii) protect the security or integrity of this Site or the rights, 
        property or safety of Perot Systems or others. </p>
      <p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
      <p> Perot Systems uses commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain 
        personal information to protect it from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction 
        by any unauthorized use. While we strive to protect your personal information, 
        Perot Systems cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information 
        you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. </p>
      <p><strong>OTHER SITES</strong></p>
      <p> Please be aware that we provide links to other websites as a convenience 
        to visitors to this Site and such third-party sites are not covered by 
        this Privacy Policy. Neither Perot Systems nor this Site are responsible 
        for the content or information collection practices of any third-party 
        linked site.</p>
      <p> <strong>CHILDREN</strong></p>
      <p> Perot Systems has no intention of collecting any personal data from 
        children (under thirteen years of age). Whenever appropriate, Perot Systems 
        will specifically instruct children not to submit personal information 
        on this Site. Additionally, if we receive such information from children, 
        we will delete the information as soon as we discover it or we will take 
        reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure parental consent to such submission.</p>
      <p> Parents should be aware that this Policy will govern our use of personal 
        data collected on this Site, but that information which is voluntarily 
        given by children in chat sessions, email exchanges, bulletin boards or 
        the like may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited contact. 
        Perot Systems encourages all parents to instruct their children in the 
        safe and responsible use of their personal data while using the Internet.</p>
      <p>Parents may review any personal information collected at this Site about 
        their children, and require that the information be deleted. However, 
        since Perot Systems does not seek to collect any personal information 
        about children, and we delete such information that we collect inadvertently 
        as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we generally retain 
        no information about children that could be reviewed or deleted. In the 
        rare event in which a parent requests review or deletion of information 
        about his or her child before we have discovered and deleted the information, 
        then Perot Systems will promptly comply with that request. </p>
      <p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
      <p>Perot Systems reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy 
        at any time. A notice will be posted on our web site home page for 30 
        days whenever this Privacy Policy is materially changed. This Privacy 
        Policy was last updated on September, 2001</p>
