            <p>In addition to the privacy notes above, users who are registered 
              to use our jobs-by-email and online CV services should note the 
              following:</p>
            <p><b>Registration details</b>: Contact details and other information 
              you supply as part of the registration process are stored by us 
              and used to provide you with the information you have requested. 
              These details will also be used to tell you about changes to the 
              service or additions to the website. </p>
            <p><b>To alter your details</b>: If your personal information changes 
              you can alter your details by using the 'my jobs file' facility 
              in the jobs area. </p>
            <p><b>CV Information: </b>If you post your CV to our database and 
              you consent to making it available, it will be accessed, either 
              via an online search over the Internet or by way of a general email 
              broadcast, by customers who may be direct recruiters, employment 
              consultants or other organisations who pay us for such access. </p>
            <p>Your CV can only be viewed by a PersonnelToday.com customer if 
              you have consented to this and you may indicate at any time, by 
              using the facility in the 'my online CV' section, that you no longer 
              wish your CV to be available. </p>
            <p>Additionally the 'my online CV ' section will list all customers 
              who are eligible to search the CV database at that time, and you 
              may select those organisations to which you do not wish your CV 
              to be made available. <b>IMPORTANT:</b> The number and identity 
              of organisations eligible to search the CV database changes continuously. 
              You must ensure that organisations you deem unsuitable do not receive 
              your CV by using the 'my online CV ' feature outlined above. </p>
            <p>We also rely on you to ensure that your CV and contact details 
              are kept up-to-date. You should update your CV at least every three 
              months, or as soon as your contact details change. </p>
            <p><b>A note about applying for jobs by email</b>: Email messages 
              may not be secure and may be intercepted by third parties. If you 
              apply for a job by email containing confidential information about
