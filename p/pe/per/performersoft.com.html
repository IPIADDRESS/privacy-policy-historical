                    Why is it important to update your <!--?php echo ucwords(str_replace('-', ' ', $_GET['brand']))?--> Drivers?</h5>
                <p>Problems with your printer, scanner, sound card, graphics card, wireless connection or other peripheral? Or is your computer just sluggish or crashes often? It's probably time to update your drivers.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;                  </p>
                <p>Many common computer problems are caused by out of date drivers. When drivers aren't working well, the parts of your computer can't 'talk' to each other. The companies that make all those parts issue new and improved versions all the time. But you don't have any way to get them... unless you enjoy spending hours every week slogging through those awful websites. And even then, it's not always that easy to choose the right driver for your computer.                  </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
