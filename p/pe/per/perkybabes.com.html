<h2>Privacy Policy Effective Date: April 23, 2013 </h2>

<p>[Last Modified on April 23, 2013] <br>
  I. General <br>
  <br>
  A. The operative parties referred to in this policy are COMPANY and   you, the user of this site.        1. COMPANY is the publisher and operator of the websites listed at the   beginning of this policy. When first-person pronouns are used in this   Policy, (us, we, our, ours, etc.) these provisions are referring to   COMPANY. Additionally, when the terms "The SITE" or "SITE" are used,   these terms refer to the websites listed at the beginning of this   policy.        2. You, the User Ã¯Â¿Â½ As the user of this SITE, this policy will refer to   the user as "you" or through any second-person pronouns, such as   "yours," etc. Hereinafter, the user of the site shall be referred to in   applicable second-person pronouns.        B. This Privacy Policy describes how we use information received about   you when you visit our SITE or when you subscribe to, or otherwise use   our online services. This Policy does not cover any information that we   may receive from or about you through channels other than through the   use of the SITE.        II. Revisions to this Policy <br>
  <br>
  We reserve the right to revise, amend, or modify this policy and our   other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner. You should   periodically check for any modifications of this Policy by re-visiting   this web page and using the "refresh" button on your browser. You should   note the date of last revision to this Policy, which appears at the top   of this Policy. If the "last modified" date remains unchanged after you   have clicked the "refresh" button on your browser, you may presume that   no changes have been made since the last reading of the policy. A   changed "last modified" dates indicates that this Policy has been   updated or edited, and the updated or edited version supersedes any   prior versions immediately upon posting.        III. Personal information that we collect <br>
  <br>
  Visitors to our site and services will have multiple manners of   interactivity with us. Depending upon your level of interaction, we will   collect different information about you. The type of information   collected is as follows:        A. Members - Members are those users who interact with our services in   a way which requires registration, such as by uploading content to the   SITE. Members will be prompted to provide their e-mail address in the   process of registering a username.        B. Browsers - Browsers are visitors to the site who never enter into   any active data collection pages. Browsers may, however, view content   uploaded by Members. Any information gathered from Browsers is also   gathered from Members. This information is restricted to cookies, IP   Addresses and Referral URLs, and other passive information gathering   devises (explained below).        IV. How we collect information from you <br>
  <br>
  A. Passive Collection Ã¯Â¿Â½ We use cookies to collect information about   you in order to enhance your experience on the site. The information   collected in our cookies includes, but is not limited to, your user IP   address, your browser information, your geographic location and other   session data.        B. Active Collection Ã¯Â¿Â½ we collect information from you, such as your   e-mail address, when you complete registration forms to sign up for your   membership on our Site. Locations for such collection are registration   pages, but we reserve the right to add additional information collection   portals.        V. How we use your information <br>
  <br>
  The primary use for your information is to provide you with services   you have requested and/or paid for. We also use your information to   deliver customized services to you, such as automatic log-in   capabilities and storage of preferences. Member login information and   e-mail addresses may be disclosed to third parties for the purpose of   providing certain features or third-party upgrades as requested by the   Member. We are not responsible for how third parties use your   information, and You should become familiar with such third parties'   privacy policies prior to requesting their services. Non-personal and   aggregate information, such as that collected passively is used in order   to customize our marketing efforts or to customize the use of our site   for an aggregate group of customers. We additionally may use the   personal information of users whose membership has expired or have been   cancelled in order to market our services to these individuals in the   future.        We generally will use your information for the purposes for which you   specifically provide it, for example, to ensure payment for subscription   services, if applicable. We also use your information for market   research purposes Ã¯Â¿Â½ in order to increase your (and other users')   experience according to tracked interests, to analyze and target   potential new markets, and for other marketing purposes.        VI. Special Cases. <br>
  <br>
  It is our policy not to use or share the personal information about   Browsers or Members in ways unrelated to those described in this Policy   without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise   prohibit such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose personal   information about Browsers or Members, or information regarding your use   of the Services or Sites accessible through our Services, for any   reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to   do so, including:        1. To satisfy any laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy   Act, regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such   information;        2. To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or   bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms &amp;   Conditions or other user policies;        3. To operate our Services properly;        4. To protect ourselves, our Members, and the general public. We   specifically reserve the right to disclose any and all information to   law enforcement in the event that a crime is committed, is suspected, or   if we are compelled to do so by lawful criminal, civil, or   administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders,   writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the   reasonable power to obtain such process.        5. We will always cooperate with law enforcement authorities,   private-party litigants, and others seeking information about our end   users to the extent required by applicable law. Examples of such   cooperation include lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process,   discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable   request of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain   such process.        6. We may provide members of the media with summarized User statistics   upon request, but we will not provide individual User information.        VII. Transmittals from Us <br>
  <br>
  We may send you periodic announcements including the details of our   existing and new programs. You may opt out of these announcements by   disabling the notifications on your User profile page. If you opt out of   these marketing emails, you may still receive system notices and other   information that is specifically related to your account.        If you provide your information to us, use the SITE, or subscribe to   any of our services, you will have created a commercial relationship   with us. In having done so, you understand that even unsolicited   commercial email sent from us or our affiliates is not SPAM as that term   is defined under the law.            VIII. Public Forums and Other Public Areas: <br>
  <br>
  A. Public Forums Ã¯Â¿Â½ at the time of the instatement of this Policy, we   currently offer Users the option to comment in public forums, to send   private messages to other Users, and to comment on other User's   profiles, and we reserve the right to offer other interactive features   in the future. We also provide services that allow Members to post   messages or comments to the public. Any and all information posted to   the SITE, whether as a comment to a video or any other post, should   immediately be considered to be public information.            IX. Our Commitment to Data Security. <br>
  <br>
  We take measures to protect the transmission of all sensitive end-user   information. We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security   of our network and systems. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that our   security measures will prevent third-party 'hackers' from illegally   obtaining this information. We take all reasonable measures to prevent   such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of   cyber-criminals we are unable to guarantee that our security is 100%   breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that   they occur despite our reasonable security measures.            X. How to Access or Modify Your Information. <br>
  <br>
  We may offer our Members the opportunity to access or modify   information provided during registration. To access or modify such   information, <a href="http://www.perkybabes.com/contact.php" target="_blank">contact</a> our Customer Service Department            XI. Where to Direct Questions About Our Privacy Policy. <br>
