User Provided Data: Users may provide personally identifiable information (such as a name and an email address) to PerfSpot when choosing to participate in the various services available on the Website, such as uploading videos and/or images or other content (collectively, the "Content") for public viewing interests, entering contests, accessing promotions, responding to surveys, accessing interactive forums, or other personalized services (collectively, the "Services").<br>b. Cookies: Cookies, a harmless small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters, are deployed to your computer so as to uniquely identify your presence and use. PerfSpot may use session cookies and persistent cookies for the purpose of tracking various important data. Use of these cookies can also help to speed your access to the Website as they serve as 'reminders' as to who you are to our programming. While we recommend that you allow these cookies to perform their tasks, you may adjust your computer's settings to restrict or refuse them. However, some features or sections of the Website may not function properly, or not all, if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.<br>c. Clear .GIFs: PerfSpot may choose to utilize "clear .GIFs" to track the online usage patterns of our Users in a non-personally identifiable manner. Additionally, PerfSpot may also use clear .GIFs in HTML-based emails dispatched to Users so as to track which emails are being opened by the recipients. This act helps PerfSpot to determine active and inactive email addresses.<br>d.
