                            PerkSpot is a portal through which users access discounts redeemable at selected
                            vendors. In most cases, online purchases facilitated by the PerkSpot portal are
                            subject to the privacy policies of the Web Site where that transaction is conducted.
                            In a few cases; however, PerkSpot itself functions as the vendor and must collect
