																				Your privacy is very important to us. We know that privacy is an important 
																				issue for our Users, and we take very seriously the protection of our Users’ 
																				personal information.<br>
																				<br>
																				Perfect Escapes is the name under which Intagio Corporation operates this 
																				PerfectEscapes.com hotel reservation and travel website (the “Site”). Within 
																				this Privacy Policy, "Perfect Escapes" and "we" refer to Intagio Corporation, a 
																				Delaware corporation maintaining its principal place of business in San 
																				Francisco, California, United States.&nbsp;
																				<br>
																				<br>
																				This Privacy Policy describes the information Perfect Escapes collects about 
																				its Users and what may happen to that information. Although this Privacy Policy 
																				may seem long, Perfect Escapes has prepared a detailed policy because we 
																				believe Users should know as much as possible about our practices, so they can 
																				make informed decisions.<br>
																				<br>
																				By using this Site, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. Perfect 
																				Escapes may amend this Privacy Policy at any time and will notify Users of any 
																				such amendment by posting the amended Privacy Policy on the Site. Any such 
																				amendment will take effect thirty (30) days after the date on which the 
																				amendment is so posted. A User’s continued use of Perfect Escapes’ services, or 
																				of this Site, following such posting will mean that the User has accepted those 
																				amendments.<br>
																				<br>
																				By accepting the Perfect Escapes User Agreement, you consent to our use and 
																				disclosure of your personally identifiable information as set forth in this 
																				Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the 
																				terms of the Perfect Escapes <a href="Agreement.aspx">User Agreement</a> and <a href="Legal.aspx">

																				Policy and to our User Agreement, including limitations on damages, arbitration

                              ESCAPES COLLECTS.</span>&nbsp;<br>
																				<br>
																				Our primary goal in collecting personal information from Users is to provide 
																				them with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using this Site. 
																				This allows Perfect Escapes to provide services and features that are aimed at 
																				meeting User needs, and to customize our Site to make their experience easier 
																				and quicker. To fully use our services, a User will need to register by 
																				providing his or her e-mail address and postal Zip Code.

                                Technology:</span><br>
																						Perfect Escapes logs IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every connection 
																						to the Internet) in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer 
																						the Site. We may track your movement within the Site, the pages from which you 
																						were referred, access times and browser types. We only use this information in 
																						aggregate and do not link it to you personally unless you opt in through 
																						registration. To gauge the effectiveness of our Site, we do collect some 
																						generic information about our Users. Our web servers automatically recognize a 
																						User's domain name, the web page from which a User enters our Site, which pages 
																						a User visits on our Site, and how much time a User spends on each page. We may 
																						use anonymous tracking technologies to collect, store and sometimes track 
																						information for statistical purposes and to improve the products and services 
																						we provide. We aggregate this information and use it to evaluate and improve 
																						our Site. We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, 
																						clear gifs, and/or third party sources for instance to verify your address or 
																						update your information and to create a "profile" of your preferences. We tie 
																						your personally identifiable information to information in the profile, in 
																						order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the 
																						content of the Site for you. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a 
																						user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this Site. We 
																						use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make 
																						it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you 
																						close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an 
																						extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following 
																						directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Persistent cookies 
																						are used to differentiate subscribers from non-subscribers, to customize the 
																						content of certain sections of the website, and enable us to track and target 
																						the interests of our Users to enhance the experience on our Site. If you reject 
																						cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some areas of our 
																						Site may be limited. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use 
																						cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This 
																						Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover 
																						the use of cookies by any advertisers.

																				<ol style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="1" start="1">
