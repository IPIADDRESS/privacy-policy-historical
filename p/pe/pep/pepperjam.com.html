      Last revision : September 9, 2000<br>
                      <br>
      The Pepperjam.com Website is committed to bringing you information that is
      tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, to protecting
      your privacy. The following is a summary of the various ways we treat the
      information you provide us while using Pepperjam.com Website.<br>
                      <br>
      The Pepperjam.com Website does not collect personally identifying
      information except with your specific knowledge and consent. We do not
      share such information with any outside party, so there is no need for you
      to "opt out" to get off mailing lists.<br>
                      <br>
      In a few cases, if you e-mail a question or some feedback to us, we
      require your e-mail address so that we can, for example, e-mail you with a
      personal reply. If you choose to supply this information we will use it
      only for the specific purpose for which you supply it - unless we tell you
      otherwise at the time of collection, in which case you'll have an option
      to forbid other uses by us.<br>
                      <br>
      In other cases, we may require certain personal information: When using
      the "Submit a Testimonial " function, for example, you must
      enter your return e-mail address. Again, we will use such information only
      for the specific purpose for which you supply it - unless we tell you
      otherwise at the time of collection, in which case you'll have an option
      to forbid other uses by us.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b>We will never share any of your personally identifying data with any
      other party without your explicit permission, nor use it for unapproved
      commercial purposes.</b><br>
                      <br>
      A few special cases are worth noting. From time to time we may run
      competitions or request material we can publish; to participate, you must
      usually supply us with your identity, which you agree to have publicly
      associated with your submission. The exact rules vary from case to case,
      and will be noted clearly on the relevant pages. Your participation will
      always be voluntary and knowing.<br>
                      <br>
      We may offer to send you information or updates from pepperjam.com Website
      via e-mail or otherwise; obviously, signing up will put you on a specific
      mailing list. We will not put you on any other mailing lists, from us or
      anyone else, without your permission.<br>
                      <br>
      You may have read about "cookies," nuggets of information that
      are placed by a Web site in a storage place on your own computer.
      Pepperjam.com Website uses cookies to control the display of ads - to
      ensure that you don't see the same ad too many times in a single session,
      for example - and to track usage patterns on our site.<br>
                      <br>
      While using Pepperjam.com Website you may notice that our advertisers
      occasionally serve you cookies, either directly or when you link to their
      sites. We cannot directly control what our advertisers or these cookies
      do, but it's our policy that advertisers on Pepperjam.com Website should
      use cookies the same way we do.<br>
                      <br>
      Your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you not to accept
      them. We don't recommend using this option, though: It makes browsing our
      site a less enjoyable experience. In fact, some of our content pages
      require at the very least, cookies for sessions.<br>
                      <br>
      Finally, while your individual information is protected as outlined above,
      we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as
      a group. For instance, we might report to potential advertisers that a
      certain percentage of our users appear to be return internet shoppers.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b>THIS PRIVACY POLICY MAY BE MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME; NOTICE OF
      CHANGES WILL APPEAR ON THIS PAGE, SO CHECK BACK OFTEN.</b> If you have
      concerns or questions about any aspect of this policy, please send us <a href="mailto:info@pepperjam.com">e-mail</a>.
      We welcome your feedback. You can also send us regular mail at the
