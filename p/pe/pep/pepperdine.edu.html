                     as a service to students, faculty, alumni, and prospective students.&nbsp; Use of the site
                     is subject to the terms and conditions set forth below in Pepperdineâs Privacy Policy
                     (âpolicyâ).&nbsp; 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Although Pepperdine respects the privacy of this siteâs users (or âmembersâ or âvisitorsâ),
                     the university collects information from its Web site members and visitors.&nbsp; The Privacy
                     Policy governs usersâ interaction with the site and usersâ registration for and use
                     of the siteâs online services.&nbsp; Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy, the
                     siteâs Terms of Service agreement, and/or other published guidelines, Pepperdine does
                     not release personally identifiable information about the siteâs visitors without
                     their permission.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Please note that Pepperdine reviews these privacy practices from time to time, and
                     that these practices are therefore subject to change.&nbsp; Pepperdine asks users to periodically
                     review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of
                     the siteâs Privacy Policy.&nbsp; To contact Pepperdine about privacy issues, to report
                     a violation of the siteâs Privacy Policy, or to raise any other issue regarding the
                     site, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:webcomm@pepperdine.edu?subject=Contact%20Us%20-%20Web%20Feedback%20-%20Privacy%20Policy">webcomm@pepperdine.edu</a>.

                  <h3>The Information Pepperdine Gathers</h3>
                  
                  <p>Pepperdine gathers two types of information about the siteâs users:</p>
                  
                  <ol>
                     
                     <li>Non-personally identifiable information.&nbsp; As users access the site, Pepperdine collects
                        and aggregates information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited,
                        the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks were employed.&nbsp; Collecting
                        such information involves the logging of IP addresses, operating system, and browser
                        software used by each visitor.&nbsp; Although such information is not personally identifiable,
                        the university can determine from the IP address a visitorâs Internet Service Provider
                        and the geographic location of the userâs point of connectivity.<br><br>The non-personally identifiable information collected helps in diagnosing any server
                        problems, administering the site, identifying the most popular areas of the site,
                        and determining the effectiveness of promotional activities.&nbsp;<br><br>For the same purposes, the university uses âcookiesâ â that is, small text files placed
                        on your computerâs hard drive â to help determine the type of content and sites visited,
                        the length of time spent on a particular site, and the usage of services offered via
                        the site.&nbsp; For information on how users can control their Web browserâs acceptance
                        of cookies, please refer to the documentation accompanying the browser.<br>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>Personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Certain areas of the site may require that users
                        provide personally identifiable information (including, for example, zip code, age,
                        income, and e-mail address).&nbsp; In addition, when registering to set up an account to
                        use certain services on the site such as e-mail, chat rooms, forums, or to receive
                        newsletters or specifically targeted information (âservicesâ), Pepperdine may require
                        that users provide their name and e-mail address.<br><br>The university does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
                        children (defined herein as minors younger than thirteen years of age) without obtaining
                        parental consent.&nbsp; Before registering for an account to use the services of the site,
                        Pepperdine requests that all minors have their parents read the Privacy Policy and
                        continue their involvement throughout the registration process.<br><br>Pepperdine does not control the acts of this siteâs members or visitors.&nbsp; All members
                        and visitors should be aware that their disclosure of personally identifiable information
                        in a bulletin board, chat room, guest book, or other forum allows other parties to
                        send them unsolicited e-mail.&nbsp; In the event visitors encounter any user on this site
                        who is improperly collecting or using information provided by the siteâs members or
                        visitors, please contact <a href="mailto:webcomm@pepperdine.edu?subject=Contact%20Us%20-%20Web%20Feedback%20-%20Privacy%20Policy">webcomm@pepperdine.edu</a>.

                  <h3>How the University Uses/Does Not Use Gathered Information</h3>
                  
                  <p>Please take some time to become familiar with the different ways Pepperdine uses the
                     information gathered.&nbsp; Keep in mind that, while the university encourages all third
                     parties involved to adhere to this siteâs Privacy Policy and to otherwise handle personal
                     information in a responsible manner, Pepperdine cannot and does not assume any responsibility
                     for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they
                     use information received either from the university or independently.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
                     in the event users encounter any third party associated with, or who claims association
                     with Pepperdine, who is improperly collecting or using personal information, please
                     contact <a href="mailto:webcomm@pepperdine.edu?subject=Contact%20Us%20-%20Web%20Feedback%20-%20Privacy%20Policy">webcomm@pepperdine.edu/</a> who will forward the message to the third party.

                        identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful online
                        services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and
                        behavior of the site visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding
                        specific areas of the site.<br><br>The site may contain links to other Internet Web site, including co-branded or other
                        affiliated sites that may or may not be owned or operated by Pepperdine.&nbsp; Unless otherwise
                        explicitly stated, the university is not responsible for the privacy practices or
                        the content of such sites, including such sitesâ use of any information (such as IP
                        number, browser type, or operating system) collected when visitors to the site click
                        through links to those sites.&nbsp; Even though such information might not identify the
                        user personally, users should be familiar with the privacy practices of those other
                        sites.<br>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>Use of personally identifiable information.&nbsp; The university provides notice to potential
                        registrants of this site whose personally identifiable information will be collected
                        during the registration process.&nbsp; Such notice is provided simultaneously with the
                        userâs registration on this site; moreover, this policy itself serves as notice that
                        such information is collected under those circumstances.&nbsp; Although users may not âopt
                        outâ of the registration process and still receive access to the services, users may
                        choose to âopt outâ of receiving promotional materials from the university and/or
                        other business partners.&nbsp; If the user does not âopt outâ of receiving such promotional
                        materials, Pepperdine reserves the right to release userâs personally identifiable
                        registration information to third parties who provide goods or services that the university
                        believes may be of interest to the user.&nbsp; If the user decides to discontinue receiving
                        promotional information from such third parties, please contact those third parties
                        directly, or contact Pepperdine at <a href="mailto:webcomm@pepperdine.edu?subject=Contact%20Us%20-%20Web%20Feedback%20-%20Privacy%20Policy">webcomm@pepperdine.edu</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>Pepperdine limits its own e-mail contact and solicitations to those users who have
                        not âopted outâ of receiving such communications.&nbsp; The solicitations are limited in
                        that they, among other things, will clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail
                        and provide the user with a method of âopting outâ of receiving future communications
                        of a similar nature.<br><br>Finally, Pepperdine may use individual membersâ data to âpre-populateâ forms, which
                        are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual data by the university.&nbsp; In
                        no case does pre-populating a form transfer any data to any third party.&nbsp; Only if
                        the user voluntarily requests that such data be transferred will any transfer take
                        place â for example, if/when a user clicks a âsubmit formâ button or other button.<br><br>Pepperdine reserves the right to release any and all information contained within
                        access logs concerning any visitor when that visitor is in violation of the universityâs
                        âTerms of Serviceâ agreement or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably
                        suspected of partaking) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant,
                        or other court order, and to release such information in response to discovery requests,
                        or in response to any circumstance in which the university, in its sole discretion,
                        deems an emergency.&nbsp; Pepperdine cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying
                        those who may be using its servers or services for illegal activities.&nbsp; Pepperdine
                        also reserves the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement
                        for investigation or prosecution.<br><br>Pepperdine will post the relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or
                        registration area for any promotions it sponsors.&nbsp; That privacy information, to the
                        extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that particular promotion.

                  <h3>Security</h3>
                  
                  <p>All information gathered on the site is stored within a controlled database accessible
                     only to the university to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information
                     under its control.&nbsp; However, as effective as any security measure implemented by the
                     university may be, no security system is impenetrable.&nbsp; Pepperdine cannot guarantee
                     the security of its database, nor can it guarantee that the information supplied by
                     users will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.&nbsp; Questions
                     regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to <a href="mailto:webcomm@pepperdine.edu?subject=Contact%20Us%20-%20Web%20Feedback%20-%20Privacy%20Policy">webcomm@pepperdine.edu</a>.

                  <p>If users would like to have personally identifiable information changed or removed
                     from Pepperdineâs database, please contact <a href="mailto:webcomm@pepperdine.edu?subject=Contact%20Us%20-%20Web%20Feedback%20-%20Privacy%20Policy">webcomm@pepperdine.edu</a>.&nbsp; Keep in mind that there will be residual information remaining within the databases,
                     access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable
                     information.&nbsp; The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however,
                     the university reserves the right, from time to time, to re-contact former customers
                     or users of this site.
