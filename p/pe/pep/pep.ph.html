<p>
<strong>Philippine Entertainment Portal (PEP)</strong> is defined as all websites, web pages and channels owned, controlled and/or operated by the same people who brought you YES! Magazine, the number one entertainment title in the country.
</p>
<br>
<p>
We frequently provide information and links to third-party advertisers or partners. Information on how to access the privacy practices of these third parties is included below as well. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
We will notify our members when we make any significant changes to our Privacy Policy that affect the use of any personally identifiable information we collect. We will not make new use of any personally identifiable information which PEP gathered from individual members or visitors prior to any such significant change in our Privacy Policy without first obtaining the member's or visitor's consent for any new uses. In instances where we ask for your personally identifiable information and we tell you the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with unaffiliated third parties, and in cases where a member, visitor or subscriber to PEP opts-in to share his/her information with third parties, those disclosures and opt-ins will override anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy. In addition, PEP reserves the right to make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that will not affect PEP's use of a user's personally identifiable information at any time without any notice to you other than posting any such changes in a revised Privacy Policy on PEP. We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Policy to be sure you are familiar with the most current version. The Policy will include the most recent date in which any revision has been made. Please note that this Privacy Policy is also incorporated into PEP's <a href="../tos/" style="font-weight:bold">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>Information that PEP collects </strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
PEP gathers two basic types of information:
</p>
<br><br>
<ul style="list-type:square; margin-left:40px;">
<li>
	<strong>Information provided to PEP</strong>
	<br><br>
	In order to use many of PEP's features, tools and services, we ask you to register to become a member. During this member registration process, we will ask for your personally identifiable information such as your name, mobile/phone number, email address, mailing address, zip code, country, gender, birthdate, age, member name and password. In addition, you may choose to provide PEP with additional information including marital status, household income, education, and employment status. 
	<br><br>
	PEP uses the information it gathers for several purposes, such as to understand more about our audience's interests, to communicate with you and to give you a better experience when visiting PEP by personalizing tools, content, services and email messages (more details below). PEP also uses this information to build new services and develop offers that PEP believes are more relevant and valuable to you.
	<br><br>
	PEP, its advertisers and partners may ask you for information in order to provide you with access to goods, services and tools. When personally identifiable information provided by you is (i) collected by PEP and/or a PEP sponsor or partner or (ii) collected by PEP and shared with a PEP sponsor or partner, your permission will be obtained and you will be advised as to which privacy policy(ies) will control the collection and dissemination of the information provided if different from PEP's policy.
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
	<strong>Information gathered by PEP</strong>
	<br><br>
	When you visit PEP and interact with the services and tools that reside there, PEP and third parties with whom PEP has contracted to provide services to PEP may collect information on your actions. This type of information is generally collected from two sources. One is from the server log files and the other is from cookies. 
</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>How information is collected and disseminated</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The information collected by PEP is used to create aggregated portraits of the PEP audience, portraits which present anonymous statistical demographic information but no personally identifiable information. This aggregated information is used, among other things, to determine trends and needs, and also to supply market research to potential advertisers and partners to help them understand who the PEP audience is. For example, we may create a report that tells advertisers that 60 percent of our members are females in a certain age range, so that they can determine which of their products or services are most appropriate for our members.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In order to better describe how information is collected and disseminated, please carefully review the list below. 
</p>
<br><br>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
<li>Membership Registration </li>
<li>Order Forms and Transactions with E-Commerce Partners And Advertisers </li>

<br><br>
<p>
<strong>Membership registration</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Many areas of PEP are reserved for PEP members who have registered with us; for example, chats, message boards and access to special services such as email, member pages, special offers and promos. This is necessary so that PEP can assure the quality of its forums. Registration is free. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The membership registration form currently requires you to choose a member name and password and provide PEP with your first and last names, email address, mailing address, zip code, country, gender, age and birthdate. The form also includes optional information that you may choose to provide to us like marital status, household income, education and employment status. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The personally identifiable information you provide during membership registration will not be given to unaffiliated third parties without your consent except in the limited circumstances described in the section of this Privacy Policy entitled "Information Sharing Policy".
</p>
<br>
<p>
Order forms and transactions with e-commerce partners and advertisers
</p>
<br>
<p>
The information provided via order forms is generally shared with advertisers and partners on an aggregated basis. In the event that an advertiser or partner wishes to offer free samples, or provide information about products and services and to do so requires personally identifiable information, PEP will provide you with the ability to "opt-in" and will often provide you access to the Privacy Policy of the advertiser for your review via a link. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "opt-in" is generally defined as any affirmative action by a PEP member or visitor to submit or receive information, as the case may be. When you provide personal, financial, and other personally identifiable information to one of PEP's e-commerce partners, this transaction will occur on the e-commerce partner's site, not PEP and as such the financial and personally identifiable information you provide is collected by and controlled by the Privacy Policy of that e-commerce partner. It is important therefore that you familiarize yourself with the Privacy Policy of the e-commerce site with which you transact business.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>Electronic newsletters and reminders </strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
PEP offers free electronic newsletters on a variety of topics. If you choose to subscribe to any of these newsletters, currently the only information you will be required to provide is a valid email address. In order to receive these newsletters you must opt-in to receiving them. Generally, PEP does not share mailing lists from its electronic newsletters with third parties. However, in some situations, PEP may share its newsletter mailing lists with third parties who provide newsletter and/or reminder fulfillment services on behalf of PEP. In these instances, such third parties will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. Additionally, PEP may provide third parties with a list of PEP members and visitors who have opted-in to receiving additional information from third parties. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
In those instances where you opt-in to subscribe to a newsletter through a third-party email service or advertiser or partner, the email address information sometimes will be located on the third party's server, in which case we generally will notify you. In those cases, any information you provide is subject to that entity's Privacy Policy, not this one. Some of our partners' and advertisers' sites require that you specifically opt-out from receiving their newsletters. As a result, to stop receiving them you will need to affirmatively opt-out from the third party newsletter.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>Public forums/chat rooms/message boards/message boards/bulletin boards</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Throughout PEP various public forums such as chat rooms, message boards, "ask the expert" areas and various question and answer areas are available to you as a registered PEP member. Please remember that any information you disclose in these public forum areas becomes public information and is immediately accessible on PEP, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when deciding to reveal personal information and/or issuing your comments, feedback, and suggestions regarding a certain story or topic, or even photos. PEP may decide to utilize the content of forums, interactions with experts, and/or chat room and message board content throughout PEP and in promotions in order to enhance PEP's editorial, advertising, promotional and similar activities. In those cases we often provide authorship credit by listing the author's member name. We therefore encourage you to use care in protecting your identity when you choose a member name and to keep your member name confidential.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>Surveys and polls</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Our surveys ask for opinions on various issues and very often these surveys and polls are sponsored by or associated with PEP advertisers and partners. Occasionally, we may request demographic information (like address, age or gender). Most information obtained through surveys and polls is aggregated and used internally or shared with advertisers and partners only in the aggregated form. In the event personally identifiable information is requested as part of surveys or polls about any PEP member or subscriber, such personally identifiable information is never provided to unaffiliated third parties without your consent. In these instances you may expressly choose to receive information from a sponsor, in which case your information is provided to that sponsor only. Some survey answers may be added to your member portrait (so that we can better provide you with content, ads and offers that are most appropriate for you).
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>Contests and other promos</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We regularly operate contests and other promos throughout PEP. We typically ask you for your email address and mobile/phone number (to notify you if you've won, or not). We also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses in order to verify the entrant's identity. In some situations, we need additional information as part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. This information is shared with an unaffiliated third party: 
</p>
<br><br>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
<li>When you choose to receive information from a third party promo sponsor; </li>
<li>When a contest or promo is hosted by PEP but administered by a sponsor, again, we will advise you of this in the contest or promo rules; or </li>
<li>Most contests and other promos will also ask you to consent to the release of information contained within the entry form for tax purposes if you become a winner. </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<p>
You should carefully review the rules of each contest and promo which you enter as they may contain additional important information about PEP's or a sponsor's use of your personally identifiable information.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>"Send this to a friend" and postcard service</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
PEP offers the ability to forward an article to another person via email or to send an electronic postcard. If you use either of these services, we will use the recipient's email address in order to send the article or postcard and we will also ask for your email address. In the case of postcards, we will ask for your email address and each may be stored so that we can ensure delivery and that the recipient can retrieve the postcard. We do not use the recipient's email address for any other purpose unless such recipient gives us permission to do so.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Links to partner and advertiser sites </strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
PEP contains links to advertiser and partner websites. We cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such non-PEP websites, and we do not control the practices of any of our advertisers or partners to whom we are linked. However, we generally will advise you when you are leaving PEP through a link, and when that advertiser's or partner's Privacy Policy controls the collection and dissemination of the information you provide.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In order to participate in the partner and/or advertiser supplied services and tools you may be required to provide personally identifiable information to the advertisers and partners whose tools and services you have chosen to interact with. Each advertiser and partner will request different information from you.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In any instance where personally identifiable information is required to be provided to or shared with PEP advertisers and partners, PEP generally will advise you when such advertiser or partner will receive your personally identifiable information, and further advise you as to which Privacy Policy will control the collection and dissemination of personally identifiable information you provide. PEP will use commercially reasonable efforts to contractually require all such third party advertisers and partners to agree to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The information you provide via links to co-branded pages, co-branded sites, third party sites or tools may be shared with advertisers and partners on an aggregated basis and in these instances your permission will not be requested since no personally identifiable information will be shared or provided to these third party sponsors or advertisers. PEP will, however, use commercially reasonable efforts to contractually require all such third party advertisers and partners to agree not to use any non-personally identifiable information about you, in conjunction with other sources of information, or otherwise, to identify you.
</p>
<br>
<p>
If you have additional questions about how one of our advertisers, partners or sponsors use information about you, we urge you to contact them directly.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>Information sharing policy </strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
PEP does not sell or otherwise share personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties without your consent except in the following instances: (i) unless required by applicable law or pursuant to a court or similar order; (ii) as deemed necessary, in PEP's discretion, to protect the legal rights or the property of PEP, a member or third party, or to prevent personal injury; and/or (iii) in the event PEP is required to transfer personally identifiable information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of PEP or its affiliated entities (including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). In addition, PEP reserves the right to allow access to its systems to third parties providing necessary technical services when such access is required in order to provide those services and to provide your personally identifiable information to third parties who provide services on behalf of PEP, provided that such third parties are bound by PEP's Privacy Policy. Please note, however, that PEP reserves the right to share any personally identifiable or other information about you which you provide to (or which is gathered by) PEP with any or all of its subsidiaries and affiliates, and will also have access to any such information which you provide to (or which is gathered by) the web sites of any of our Affiliates.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>PEP opt-in/opt-out policy </strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Upon registration or from time-to-time, you may be asked to indicate whether you are interested in receiving information from us about special offers or news about our sites and advertisers. You will also be provided with the opportunity to opt-in to receive offers directly from select companies other than PEP. If you do choose to receive these communications by means of an opt-in, we will occasionally send you an email message that matches your request(s). You may, of course, always choose not to receive any of this information from us. We currently provide the following opt-out opportunities: 
</p>
<br><br>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
<li>Upon registration, you can choose to receive no communications from us other than an initial member welcome message. </li>
<li>At any time, you can follow a link provided in every newsletter or email message (except for e-commerce confirmation emails) to unsubscribe from that mailing list or email service. </li>
<li>At any time, you can contact us by email to have your contact preference changed to "Do Not Contact Me." </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<p>
Please note that PEP reserves the right to contact you in the event of a change in the PEP Terms of Service and/or this Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
At any time, you can opt out of having your personally identifiable information shared with our Affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. 
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>Change/modify/archive information </strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
PEP provides you with the ability to access, correct or change certain information in your member portrait at any time, including contact information or other information you've provided to us. However, you cannot currently change your member name although you may re-register and choose a new name. Please be advised that PEP currently archives information it collects on its members and visitors. 
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>How we protect and secure your information</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
PEP has numerous security measures in place to protect you from the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control, including your credit card information if you choose to conduct an e-commerce transaction on PEP. All of your member information, as well as other sensitive areas like your free PEP email account, require use of your password. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
PEP uses industry-standard tools, such as firewalls, to ensure that your information is secure and confidential. 
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>Guidelines regarding children </strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Personal information about children is a concern for all of us. At PEP, we take the protection of children's privacy very seriously. PEP does not encourage participation or visitation by children. Visitors who are known to be under the age of 13 are prohibited from becoming a member. Anyone under the age of eighteen is discouraged from participating in any sex related chats or message boards and we ask that no one less than eighteen years of age become a community volunteer.
