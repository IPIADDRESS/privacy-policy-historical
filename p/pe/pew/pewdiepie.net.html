If you have questions about this policy or wish to contact us, we can be reached via any of the following:</p><dl><dt class="none">Contact Address</dt><dd>Maker Studios</dd><dd>Attn: Legal Department</dd><dd>1976 S.

We collect information from our users in a number of different ways, as detailed below. The information we collect depends on what you do when you visit our Site. Please note that we, as a general matter do not collect personally-identifying information about you, including your name, email address, telephone number or postal address, when you visit our Site,&nbsp;<strong>unless you choose to provide such information to us by registering with us and setting up an account.</strong>&nbsp;If at any time you do provide us with such information, we will collect it. For example, when you choose to like or follow our Site and/or log on to your social media accounts from our Site Maker Studios may collect your name and email address associated therewith.</p><h4>Information You Provide:</h4><ol type="1" start="1"><li><p><strong>Registration:</strong>&nbsp;In order to post comments and enable features that operate in conjunction with certain third party social networking websites from the Website, you must create an account using an email account and your name. Registrations for additional features may require additional information such as home address, email address, home telephone number, employer name, work address, gender, viewing preferences, and other information that is not otherwise publicly available.</p></li><li><p><strong>Log Files and Analytical Information:</strong>&nbsp;For each visitor to our Website, we automatically gather certain information and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We collect and store this information on an individual basis and in aggregate, or combined, form. We also collect both user-specific and aggregate information on what pages visitors' access or visit. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We also use this information to improve the content of our web pages, and to customize the content and layout of our pages. All of this is done with the intention of making our Site more useful to visitors. We do not correlate this information with data about individual users.</p><p>We use one or more third-party tracking services to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site in the aggregate. These third-party services may use JavaScript, pixels, transparent GIF files, and other means to enable us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Website. Any information we track in this manner is anonymous, limited to usage and volume statistics, and is used to provide insight into the effectiveness of our online marketing initiatives and strategies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Website Activities</strong>&nbsp;From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys or contests on the Website, or to participate in other voluntary activities through the site. We may request personally-identifying information from you, along with other information, in order for you to participate. Participation in these activities is completely voluntary; therefore, you can elect not to disclosure your personal information by not participating in the activity.</p><p>We use the information we collect through these activities to monitor the interests and attitudes of visitors to our site, to ensure that our site provides information that is relevant and helpful, to contact activity participants, and to carry out the activity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Device information:</strong>&nbsp;We may collect information such as your hardware model, operating system version, mobile network information and other unique device specific information to improve services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cookies</strong>&nbsp;We use both session cookies and persistent cookies on this Website. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We may link the information we store in cookies to your personal information in order to provide a faster and more pleasant online experience. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this Site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site will be limited.</p><p>We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. We use session cookies to record session information, such as which web pages a user has visited, and to track user activity on the Site. Session cookies expire when you close your browser.</p><p>We use persistent cookies to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your browser's "help" file.</p><p>In addition, certain advertisements may make use of cookies, beacon data, metadata, usage data, and streaming data to collect information regarding advertisement performance and end user interests which may be shared with third parties. These advertisements do not collect any personally identification information from users.</p></li></ol></li><li><h3>USE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION BY MAKER STUDIOS</h3><p>We will use personally-identifying information in connection with the purpose for which you provided it (e.g., to contact you with a response to a request for information or consideration).

The means by which Maker Studios will use to contact you with this information will depend on the type of information you have provided. For example, if you provide us with your email address, you may receive periodic promotional emails from us. If you provide us with your postal address, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services.</p><p>If you do not wish to receive special offers and other promotional information from us, you may opt out of receiving such communications, as discussed below.</p></li><li><h3>USE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES</h3><p>As a general rule, Maker Studios will not disclose any of your personal information except to our affiliated companies and except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the ways in which your information may be disclosed.</p><p>We do not rent or sell email addresses, postal addresses or telephone contact information to third parties, or otherwise share any personally-identifying information we collect, with any third parties (other than our affiliated entities) except as set forth below.</p><ol type="1" start="1"><li><p>We reserve the right to transfer personally-identifying information to a third party in conjunction with the sale or similar transfer of Maker Studios and/or its assets.</p></li><li><p>We reserve the right to transfer personally-identifying information to a third party as required by law or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, to comply with a court order or other legal process, and otherwise to cooperate with authorities in connection with investigations of crimes or other wrongdoing.</p><p>If we do share personally-identifying information with an entity working on our behalf, we will employ commercially-appropriate procedures to help ensure that the disclosed information is used only for authorized purposes by authorized persons, and that safeguards are in place to help maintain the security, integrity and privacy of the information.</p><p>You may opt out of having your information shared with entities working on our behalf, as discussed below. However, should you do so, you should be aware that we may not thereafter be able to provide you with our full range of services.</p></li></ol></li><li><h3>OPT OUT PROCEDURES</h3><p>If you do not wish to receive promotional emails from us, please let us know by using the opt-out response device that can be found at the bottom of every email we deliver or by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@makerstudios.com">privacy@makerstudios.com.</a> To help us process your request, please include sufficient information for us to identify you in our records (your email address will suffice).

We're a community of many types of individuals, who all have the right to feel comfortable and who may not think what you think, believe what you believe or see what you see. Trolling and flaming will not be tolerated and will result in a suspension or a ban.</p></li><li><p><strong>No Hate Speech.</strong>&nbsp;We encourage free speech and defend everyone's right to express unpopular points of view. But we don't permit hate speech (speech which attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, and sexual orientation/gender identity).</p></li><li><p><strong>Profane language is not allowed.</strong>&nbsp;If you wouldn't want your grandma to read it, don't post it.</p></li><li><p><strong>TYPING IN ALL CAPS IS CONSIDERED YELLING AND MAKES THINGS MORE DIFFICULT TO READ.</strong>&nbsp;Save our eyes. Don't type in all caps.</p></li><li><p><strong>Linking to porn or shock sites will result in a ban.</strong>&nbsp;If you wouldn't want your grandma seeing it, don't post it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discussion of any illegal activities is prohibited.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Post your topic in the forum in which it belongs.</strong>&nbsp;No one will think to look for collaboration work in the site suggestions forum. If you're not sure on where your topic belongs, just read the sticky posts, or read the other threads in the forum. That should give you a good idea of what belongs where.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not post meaningless junk.</strong>&nbsp;This isn't Facebook or Twitter. We don't care that you're eating some really awesome cereal. If your post isn't insightful or informative please keep it off of the forums.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not spam.</strong>&nbsp;Posting the same topic repeatedly is spamming. Excessive bumping of topics is spamming. If a topic doesn't receive a reply within one day, then bumping is allowed. Peer review posts should not be bumped by the original poster unless they are replying to feedback.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>No advertising.</strong>&nbsp;If you want to advertise your channel, website, social media, etc. please do so in your signature. We do not allow advertisements. If you're unsure about something that could potentially be an advertisement, please send a message to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@makerstudios.com">privacy@makerstudios.com</a></p></li><li><p><strong>No selling or buying.</strong>&nbsp;If you want to advertise your services (graphics work, eBay page, whatever) please do so in your signature. We do not allow selling or buying on the forum.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Signatures</strong>&nbsp;are limited to text only, and must follow the same guidelines as posts. We reserve the right to remove a signature without warning if it violates any of our guidelines. Do not make the font in your signature huge. It will either be edited, or deleted by a staff member.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>No backseat moderation.</strong>&nbsp;We reserve the right, but do not have an obligation, to monitor and/or review all post. If there is a problem with a post, hit the report button that is at the bottom of every single post. Unless you are a staff member or moderator it is not your place to moderate the forum.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Please note that all of the rules apply across the forum globally to posts, signatures, avatars, private messages, etc. Failure to follow any of the rules may result in having your forum account suspended or banned at the discretion of the Maker Studios staff.</p><p>We reserve the right to alter the guidelines and rules at any time, with or without notice. Check this post often for any changes. Ignorance of the rules is not a free pass from a suspension or ban. If you don't feel that you can abide by these Community Guidelines as outlined above, then PewDiePie may not be for you.
