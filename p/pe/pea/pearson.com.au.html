        <a name="info"></a>

        <h3>What information we collect</h3>
<p>The personal information we collect  about you includes (but is not limited to) your name, contact details  (including phone numbers and addresses), gender, date of birth, occupation and  other information which may assist us in conducting our business, and providing  and marketing our products and services. In certain circumstances we collect  financial information, including your credit card information where  appropriate.</p>
<p>We (for example, through our Pearson  Clinical and Talent Assessment division) may also collect sensitive information  from you (such as health information about you) only if you consent to our  collection of such information and the information is reasonably necessary for  one or more of our functions or activities (or we are otherwise permitted or  required by law to do so), including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>where  such information is relevant to any research project conducted by us, in which  you participate or wish to participate.</li>
  <li>where  such information is required in order for us to be able to provide our goods or  services to you (including psychological testing materials or services to  assess intelligence, memory, neurocognitive functioning, academic achievement,  work aptitude and personality, learning and developmental delay, or speech and  motor disabilities).</li>
</ul>
<p>We also collect information about you  that is not personal information. For example, we may collect data relating to  your activity on our websites (including the type of internet browser you use,  your operating system, address of referring site, your IP address and other  clickstream information) via tracking technologies such as cookies, or we may  collect information from you in response to a survey, promotion or competition.  We may use Google Analytic tools from time to time including Remarketing,  Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager  integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. We  generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer  our services, diagnose problems, advertise online, optimize our advertising and  websites and target and improve the quality of our products and services.</p>
<p>  Cookies allow your browser to utilise  some of the features of our websites. We use both session ID cookies and  persistent cookies, first party cookies (such as Google Analytics cookie) and  third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform,  optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website, to  report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with  these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site.  Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the  Internet. Most web browsers are set by default to accept cookies. If you reject  cookies you will be unable to take advantage of some of the features of our  websites. To the extent this information does not constitute personal  information, the Privacy Act is not applicable and we may use this information  for any lawful purpose.</p>
<p>We generally advise that you do not  publish or communicate personal information, or at least limit the personal  information that you publish or communicate, to the public via our services,  such as in any forums, blogs or anywhere that user generated content can be  uploaded ("Non-Confidential Information"). We cannot control any  third party collection or use of your Non-Confidential Information that is  publicly available.</p>



        <a name="minor"></a>

        <h3>If you are a minor (aged under 18 years)</h3>
<p>We provide subscription services to,  and may conduct research projects (for example through our Pearson Clinical and  Talent Assessment division) involving, children and young adults who are  legally minors and may not be able to provide valid consent to our collection,  use, disclosure, storage or other handling of their personal information. From  time to time we may also conduct competitions and provide other services for  children/minors who may or may not be subscribers to our online services or  newsletters.</p>
<p>Parents and guardians of  children/minors are personally responsible for monitoring their child's/minor's  access to, and use of, our services and for providing valid approvals for their  child's/minor's participation in subscription, research projects, competition  and other promotional activities conducted by us.</p>
<p>If you are a child or young adult  under the age of 18 years, you must ask your parent or legal guardian to  approve your provision of personal information before you submit your personal  details to us.</p>



        <a name="how"></a>

        <p>How we collect it</p>
<p>We may collect your personal  information from a variety of sources, including from you, advertisers, mailing  lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business partners.</p>
<p>We will generally collect personal  information by way of forms filled out by people, face-to-face meetings,  interviews, business cards, electronic communications, telephone conversations  and from third parties (including representatives, agents and credit reporting  agencies). In addition, we collect personal information from our websites  through receiving subscription applications, job applications, applications to  participate in our research projects, competition applications and other  electronic documents.</p><p>
  We may collect your personal  information when you request, acquire or use a product or service from us,  register with us as a subscriber, member or user, provide a product or service  to us, complete a survey, consent form or questionnaire, complete assessment  materials as part of our research projects in which you participate, enter a  competition or event, contribute in a fundraising event, participate in our  services (including blogs and forums) or our research projects or when you  communicate with us electronically (including email and facsimile), by  telephone or in writing (for example if you make a complaint or provide  feedback) or where you provide personal information via social media (such as  via Facebook , Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and Tumblr).</p><p>
  If, at any time, you provide personal  or other information about someone other than yourself, you must have that  person's consent to provide such information for the purpose for which you  provide it to us.</p>



        <a name="why"></a>

        <h3>
  Why we collect it</h3>
  <p>
  The primary purpose for which we  collect information about you is to conduct our business, provide and market  our products and services to you, meet our legal or regulatory obligations, and  also for the management of business transactions entered into with us and the  administration of any accounts you have with us, and for the purposes of our  research projects in which you participate or wish to participate (including  data analysis purposes under our research projects and assessment of your  eligibility to participate in our research projects). We may state a more  specific purpose at the point we collect your information (including but not  limited to any law that requires or authorises the particular information to be  collected).</p><p>
  If you do not provide us with all or  some of the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with  our products or services or include you as a participant in our research  projects. For example, if you do not register as a member of a website, you  will not be able to access features or services that are reserved for members  or subscribers only.</p>
