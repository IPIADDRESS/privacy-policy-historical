   		<p>Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Peanut Labs is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your information. As a data collection company, we provide accurate and dependable data to the market research industry. Our services offer respondents the opportunity to take part in market research and express opinions and attitudes regarding a broad range of subjects. Our clients depend on this information to make many decisions that affect the products and services in the marketplace. Any data that we collect for a study is reported only in aggregate, and specific information regarding individuals is never viewed or published. All information gathered, either during registration or in supplemental demographic surveys is provided the highest level of security.</p>
<p>What We Gather</p>
<p>We obtain some personal information during the registration process that helps to identify the types of studies most in line with a person’s buying habits, interests, or product usage. In order to participate in surveys, participants need to fill out general consumer information and limited personal information. For instance; if we are looking to conduct a survey among coffee drinkers, we would only choose those persons who indicated in their registration that they drink coffee products. We also ask demographic information (e.g., gender, birth date, household income, and zip or country code).</p>
<p>Information Use</p>
<p>Peanut Labs will never sell nor share the information collected from any individual member with any third parties. The information is used only for determining which members are qualified to take market research studies. Information may be shared in aggregate to our clients.</p>
<p>Children and Parents</p>
<p>Peanut Labs’ surveys and website are not designed nor intended for use by children under the age of 13. If you are under 18, you should not participate in our panel or use our site unless a parent or guardian is present. Children under 13 may not submit any personally identifiable information to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information for a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it. Children over 13 should only provide us with personally identifiable information if they have explicit permission from a parent or legal guardian. If your child has submitted personal information, and you wish to delete such information, as well as refuse to allow any further collection or use of your child’s information, please contact us at the address provided below. Peanut Labs adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>
<p>Survey Opt-Out Policy</p>
<p>By filling out a profile, you agree to receive invitations to participate in our Internet surveys. If you would like to discontinue receiving invitations to participate, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:support@peanutlabs.com">support@peanutlabs.com</a> and write "Remove Name" in the subject line. If a respondent chooses to formally end their survey participation, all information related to their individual profile will be permanently removed from our database. It can take two (2) to three (3) business days to completely remove the data from all of our records.</p>

<p>Security</p>

All questions are screened to ensure that they are appropriate and specific to their intended use. Unless required by law or regulation, we will never ask for your social security number.</p>
<p>Due to the technological world we live in and the constant threat to Internet security we can only be held liable for a breech of security if it is due to the negligence of the company and within the control of the company to have prevented it from occurring. If someone hacks into our site for the purpose of stealing our data, we cannot be held accountable for such action except to prosecute such an individual to the fullest extent that the law provides.</p>
<p>Legal Disclaimer</p>
<p>Peanut Labs may be required by law to disclose personal information in order to comply with a current judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Company or website. In such an event we will notify individuals that such an action has been taken and at the same time divulge such information as has been subpoenaed after conferring with our attorney.</p>
<p>Business Transfer</p>
<p>Peanut Labs could choose to sell or transfer part or substantially all of its business assets as part of a private business transaction (e.g., merger, IPO, sale), which could include the market research division, at any time. Any business transaction of this nature would only be to an entity or corporation that agreed to comply with all of the terms and conditions of our privacy policies. Any changes that such a company or entity would make to the privacy provisions of this document would require pre-notification to all respondents of such changes and new intentions regarding the use of the information.</p>
