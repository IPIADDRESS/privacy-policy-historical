			<div class="leftMedium text11 topLarge">
			Peanut Labs is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your information. As a data collection company, we provide accurate and dependable data to the market research industry. Our services offer respondents the opportunity to take part in market research and express opinions and attitudes regarding a broad range of subjects. Our clients depend on this information to make many decisions that affect the products and services in the marketplace. Any data that we collect for a study is reported only in aggregate, and specific information regarding individuals is never viewed or published. All information gathered, either during registration or in supplemental demographic surveys is provided the highest level of security.
</div>
			<div class="leftMedium text11">
				<div class="topSmall bottomSmall bold text11">What We Gather</div>
We obtain some personal information during the registration process that helps to identify the types of studies most in line with a person’s buying habits, interests, or product usage. In order to participate in surveys, participants need to fill out general consumer information and limited personal information. For instance; if we are looking to conduct a survey among coffee drinkers, we would only choose those persons who indicated in their registration that they drink coffee products. We also ask demographic information (e.g., gender, birth date, household income, and zip or country code).

			<div class="leftMedium text11">
<div class="topSmall bottomSmall bold text11">Information Use</div>
Peanut Labs will never sell nor share the information collected from any individual member with any third parties.  The information is used only for determining which members are qualified to take market research studies.  Information may be shared in aggregate to our clients.

Children over 13 should only provide us with personally identifiable information if they have explicit permission from a parent or legal guardian. If your child has submitted personal information, and you wish to delete such information, as well as refuse to allow any further collection or use of your child’s information, please contact us at the address provided below.
