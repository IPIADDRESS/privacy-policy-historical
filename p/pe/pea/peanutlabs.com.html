(“Peanut Labs”) is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your information on our Website <a href="http://www.peanutlabs.com">www.peanutlabs.com</a> and on the Peanut Labs platform. As a data collection company, we provide accurate and dependable data to the market research industry. Our services offer respondents the opportunity to take part in market research and express opinions and attitudes regarding a broad range of subjects. Our clients depend on this information to make many decisions that affect the products and services in the marketplace. Any data that we collect for a study is reported only in aggregate, and specific information regarding individuals is never viewed or published. All information gathered either during registration or in supplemental demographic surveys is provided the highest level of security.</p>
<p><strong>Trans-National Data Flow</strong></p>
<p>Peanut Labs adheres to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines, specifically the Fair Information Practices governing the protection of privacy. This involves the trans-border data flows of personal data. International Data Transfers are defined as the transmission of personal information from one jurisdiction to another. Many jurisdictions, most notably the European Union (EU), place significant restrictions on such transfers. The EU requires that the receiving jurisdiction be judged to have “adequate” data protection practices.</p>
<p>Peanut Labs transfers data between the EU and the U.S. in accordance with standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries (“Model Contract”) pursuant to the Commission Decision 2010/87/EU of 5th February, 2010.</p>
<p><strong>EU-U.S. Privacy Shield</strong></p>
<p>Peanut Labs(and its parent company Research Now Group, Inc.) participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Peanut Labs is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list" target="_blank">Privacy Shield List</a>.</p>
<p>Peanut Labs is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Peanut Labs complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
<p>Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Peanut Labs and our partners, affiliates, advertisers, research clients, analytics services and service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
<p>We use cookies to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference) and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.</p>
<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information. IP addresses are not tied to personal information. IP addresses are only used to insure the same user does not respond to a survey multiple times.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Peanut Labs adheres to strict rules that ensure every aspect of our data is secure, including the aggregated information processed on our platform. Access to all profile information is restricted to a few key personnel in order to prevent the loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. When partners enter sensitive information, such as bank account information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>Our security policies and procedures are reviewed constantly to ensure that we utilize standard technology and internal processes that best protect respondents’ information entrusted to us. All questions are screened to ensure that they are appropriate and specific to their intended use. Unless required by law or regulation, we will never ask for your social security number.</p>
<p>Due to the technological world we live in and the constant threat to Internet security we can only be held liable for a breach of security if it is due to the negligence of the company and within the control of the company to have prevented it from occurring. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If someone hacks into our site for the purpose of stealing our data, we cannot be held accountable for such action except to prosecute such an individual to the fullest extent that the law provides.If you have any questions about security, please contact us.</p>

<p>Peanut Labs may be required by law to disclose personal information in order to comply with a subpoena, current judicial proceeding, court order, or similar legal process served on our Company or website and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. In such an event we will notify individuals that such an action has been taken and at the same time divulge such information as has been subpoenaed after conferring with our attorney.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfer</strong></p>
<p>Peanut Labs could choose to sell or transfer part or substantially all of its business assets as part of a private business transaction (e.g., merger, IPO, sale), which could include the market research division, at any time. Any business transaction of this nature would only be to an entity or corporation that agreed to comply with all of the terms and conditions of our privacy policies. Any changes that such a company or entity would make to the privacy provisions of this document would require pre-notification to all respondents of such changes and new intentions regarding the use of the information.</p>
