        <p>
        There has been a trend in the ecommerce market of offering 40% - 50% off on products. 
    	You as a customer must also understand that this is not done by bearing a loss by the website.
    	Hence to offer such heavy discounts, the prices of the product are inflated to double value and a heavy promotional discount of 
    	40% - 50% is given. We @ peachmode feel that customer is cheated in the process.
        </p>
     	<p>
    	We hold you, the customer in the highest regard. Hence, we decided to do away with the 
        discount model and just offer you the best rates for our products. We give you a fixed rate
        but the best one that you will not get anywhere else. If you find our products cheaper, anywhere else,
        we will match the price and correct our mistake.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        Hoping to have you as a loyal customer. Happy shopping !
