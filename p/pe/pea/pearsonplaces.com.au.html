<p>In this Privacy Policy, "us", "we" or "our" means Pearson Australia Group Pty Ltd ABN 40 004 245 943 and its divisions (including without limitation Pearson Australia and Pearson Clinical and Talent Assessment) and related bodies corporate.</p>
<p>We recognise the importance of privacy and are committed to protecting your privacy when handling your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle personal information in an open and transparent manner in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ("Privacy Act") and other applicable privacy laws. Personal information is information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new or amended laws, new technology and/or changes to our operations and practices and the changing business environment. All personal information held by us will be governed by the most recently updated policy.</p>
<span>This policy addresses the following:</span>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>what information we collect;</li>
    <li>if you are minor (aged under 18 years);</li>
    <li>how we collect it;</li>
    <li>why we collect it;</li>
    <li>how we use it;</li>
    <li>how we disclose it;</li>
    <li>opting in and out;</li>
    <li>how we hold it - management and security; and</li>
    <li>accessing and updating or correcting your information and how to contact us.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What information we collect</h3>

<p>The personal information we collect about you includes (but is not limited to) your name, contact details (including phone numbers and addresses), gender, date of birth, occupation and other information which may assist us in conducting our business, and providing and marketing our products and services. In certain circumstances we collect financial information, including your credit card information where appropriate.</p>

<p>We (for example, through our Pearson Clinical and Talent Assessment division) may also collect sensitive information from you (such as health information about you) only if you consent to our collection of such information and the information is reasonably necessary for one or more of our functions or activities (or we are otherwise permitted or required by law to do so), including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>where such information is relevant to any research project conducted by us, in which you participate or wish to participate.</li>
    <li>where such information is required in order for us to be able to provide our goods or services to you (including psychological testing materials or services to assess intelligence, memory, neurocognitive functioning, academic achievement, work aptitude and personality, learning and developmental delay, or speech and motor disabilities).</li>

</ul>

<p>We also collect information about you that is not personal information. For example, we may collect data relating to your activity on our websites (including the type of internet browser you use, your operating system, address of referring site, your IP address and other clickstream information) via tracking technologies such as cookies, or we may collect information from you in response to a survey, promotion or competition. We may use Google Analytic tools from time to time including Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. We generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems, advertise online, optimize our advertising and websites and target and improve the quality of our products and services.</p>

<p>Cookies allow your browser to utilise some of the features of our websites. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies, first party cookies (such as Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website, to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site. Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet. Most web browsers are set by default to accept cookies. If you reject cookies you will be unable to take advantage of some of the features of our websites. To the extent this information does not constitute personal information, the Privacy Act is not applicable and we may use this information for any lawful purpose.</p>

<p>We generally advise that you do not publish or communicate personal information, or at least limit the personal information that you publish or communicate, to the public via our services, such as in any forums, blogs or anywhere that user generated content can be uploaded ("Non-Confidential Information"). We cannot control any third party collection or use of your Non-Confidential Information that is publicly available.</p>

<h3>If you are a minor (aged under 18 years)</h3>
<p>We provide subscription services to, and may conduct research projects (for example through our Pearson Clinical and Talent Assessment division) involving, children and young adults who are legally minors and may not be able to provide valid consent to our collection, use, disclosure, storage or other handling of their personal information. From time to time we may also conduct competitions and provide other services for children/minors who may or may not be subscribers to our online services or newsletters.</p>
