Pegasus’ services 
relate primarily to 
travel-related 
reservations, and 
most commonly 
involve processing 
relating to hotel 
room reservations. 
However, Pegasus’ 
processing services 
may apply to other 
types of 
transactions, such 
that references 
below to “hotels” or 
“hotel companies” 
may apply to other 
types of 
transactions you may 
seek to conduct. For 
example, Pegasus may 
process commission 
transactions 
relating to your car 
rental, train 
reservation or 
airline reservation.</font></p>

This Privacy 
Statement applies to 
“personal 
information,” 
meaning such 
information that is 
easily identifiable 
with a specific 
individual. This 
Privacy Statement 
does not apply to 
statistical or other 
information from 
which your 
personally 
identifiable 
information cannot 
be determined.<br>
<br>
<i><b>How we collect 
information</b></i><br>
Pegasus may obtain 
information about 
you in connection 
with our service 
offerings in several 
ways, including 
through central 
reservation systems, 
call centers, travel 
agents, Internet web 
sites and database 
networks. For 
example, personal 
information is 
generally collected 
in connection with a 
hotel reservation 
you make using one 
of our systems or 
the system of one of 
our hotel or travel 
agent customers.<br>
<br>
<i><b>Types of 
information we 
collect</b></i><br>
Pegasus generally 
collects only such 
personal information 
as is reasonably 
necessary to 
facilitate 
reservation, payment 
and commission 
processing 
transactions. Such 
information may 
include without 
limitation such 
basic information as 
your name, address, 
telephone and credit 
card information. 
Other information 
collected may 
include travel agent 
information, airline 
flight information, 
frequent 
guest/loyalty 
program numbers or 
membership 
information, other 
group discount 
program 
affiliations, hotel 
and room rate 
information, arrival 
and departure dates 
as well as special 
accommodation 
requirements.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Pegasus generally 
does not require or 
request any 
“sensitive data”, 
that is, information 
pertaining to racial 
or ethnic origins, 
political or 
religious beliefs, 
union membership, 
health or sex life. 
However, we may 
collect certain 
sensitive data 
solely in order to 
facilitate the 
accommodation of any 
special 
considerations you 
may have in 
connection with your 
reservation, such as 
special medical or 
dietary 
requirements. In 
addition, sensitive 
data could be 
inferred from your 
group or loyalty 
program information, 
or from other 
special preferences 
you may provide in 
connection with your 
reservation. 
However, Pegasus 
does not use or 
share any such 
information for any 
purpose other than 
as described below.<br>
<br>
<i><b>How we use 
your information</b></i><br>
We use your personal 
information to 
facilitate the 
provision of our 
services, and allow 
your chosen hotel 
company, travel 
agent or other 
service provider to 
provide its services 
to you. 
Specifically, your 
personal information 
is used to process 
your hotel 
reservation, as well 
as to process any 
commission or other 
amounts that may be 
payable to your 
travel agent or 
other intermediary 
in connection with 
your reservation. 
Credit card 
information is used 
only for payment 
processing and fraud 
prevention.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Any “sensitive data” 
is collected only to 
facilitate 
accommodation of any 
special 
considerations you 
may have in 
connection with your 
reservation, and/or 
to process your 
reservation 
transactions 
properly, such as at 
the appropriate 
group discount rate.
</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
We currently do not 
use personal 
information in 
connection with any 
of our marketing 
activities, but have 
no control over 
whether your 
personal information 
is used for 
marketing or other 
activities by your 
hotel company, 
travel agent or 
other intermediary.<br>
<br>
<i><b>Who we share 
your information 
with; Your 
information and 
third party 
companies</b></i><br>
Pegasus does not 
sell, rent or lease 
your personal 
information to 
others. Pegasus will 
not share your 
personal information 
with third parties 
except in connection 
with the provision 
of our services to 
you and/or your 
hotel company, 
travel agent or 
other intermediary. 
We have no control 
over whether your 
personal information 
is used for 
marketing or other 
activities by your 
hotel company, 
travel agent or 
other intermediary.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Pegasus contracts 
with third-party 
service providers in 
connection with the 
performance of our 
services. For 
example, Pegasus 
uses certain banking 
institutions to 
process commission 
payments. Such 
third-party service 
providers are 
generally required 
to keep confidential 
the information 
received on behalf 
of Pegasus and may 
not use any such 
personal information 
for any purpose 
other than to carry 
out the services 
they are performing 
for Pegasus. These 
service providers 
may change or we may 
contract with 
additional service 
providers to better 
serve our customers.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Pegasus may share 
your personal 
information across 
its various business 
entities and service 
lines, all of which 
are generally 
subject to the 
requirements of this 
Privacy Statement. 
Pegasus may also 
combine with or be 
acquired by another 
business entity, in 
which case your 
information may be 
shared with such 
entity.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Pegasus will not 
otherwise share 
personal information 
with any other third 
parties without your 
permission, unless 
we assess such 
disclosure to be 
required by law.<br>
<br>
<i><b>Your choices, 
privacy preferences 
and opting out</b></i><br>
Since we generally 
only provide 
information to your 
hotel company, 
travel agent or 
other intermediary 
in connection with 
your transactions, 
if you do not wish 
for such third 
parties to obtain 
your personal 
information, then 
please be aware that 
we may not be able 
to process your 
intended 
transaction. If you 
still do not wish 
for us to share your 
information with 
such parties, then 
contact our Privacy 
Office at the 
contact information 
listed below.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
If you do not wish 
for your personal 
information to be 
disclosed to any of 
our third party 
service providers, 
please contact our 
Privacy Office at 
the contact 
information listed 
below. Within a 
reasonable time 
after receiving your 
request to not 
distribute your 
personal information 
to such third 
parties, we will 
either cease any 
further distribution 
to such third 
parties or notify 
you if such 
cessation is not 
reasonably 
practicable. Please 
keep in mind that if 
Pegasus cannot 
disclose or share 
your information 
with such third 
parties, then we may 
not be able to 
provide you with all 
or certain of our 
reservation,

processing or other

<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Pegasus may send 
marketing 
information about 
its products and 
services to its 
affiliated travel 
agents, hotel 
companies and other 
business partners, 
but such marketing 
information 
generally will not 
contain your 
personal 
information. Pegasus 
generally does not 
send marketing 
information to 
individual providers 
of personal 
information. 
However, if you are 
receiving Pegasus 
marketing materials 
and do not wish to 
receive such 
materials, please 
contact our Privacy 
Office at the 
contact information

Pegasus generally 
has no control over 
the marketing and 
other onward 
distribution 
activities of travel

<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Pegasus will make 
all reasonable 
efforts to honor 
your preferences.<br>
<br>
<i><b>Access to and 
accuracy of your 
information</b></i><br>
Pegasus strives to 
keep your personal 
information 
accurate. We have 
implemented 
technology, 
management processes 
and policies to 
maintain data 
accuracy. Upon 
request to our 
Privacy Office, we 
will use all 
reasonable efforts 
to provide you with 
access to your 
information, 
including the 
opportunity to 
change your 
information. To 
protect your privacy 
and security, we 
will also take 
reasonable steps to 
verify your identity 
before granting 
access to your data. 
Certain areas of 
Pegasus’ websites 
may limit access to 
specific individuals 
through the use of 
passwords and other 
personal 
identifiers.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Certain personal 
information stored 
on Pegasus systems 
is routinely deleted 
as it determined to 
become irrelevant. 
However, such 
routine deletion 
practices vary with 
respect to different 
services and types 
of information and 
some information may 
be stored 
indefinitely.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
The most effective 
way to ensure the 
accuracy of your 
personal information 
in our records is to 
take care that you, 
your hotel, your 
agent or other 
intermediary inputs 
your information 
correctly.<br>
<br>
<i><b>Keeping your 
information secure</b></i><br>
Pegasus is committed 
to protecting the 
information that you 
and our customers 
and business 
partners provide to 
us. To prevent 
unauthorized access 
or disclosure, to 
maintain data 
accuracy, and to 
ensure the 
appropriate use of 
the information, 
Pegasus has in place 
appropriate physical 
and managerial 
procedures to 
safeguard the 
information we 
collect.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Our data centers and 
systems employ 
various layers of 
access codes and 
monitoring to 
prevent unauthorized 
access, and 
authorized access to 
your personal 
information is 
generally restricted 
to our 
representatives with 
a reasonable need 
for such access. We 
generally employ 128 
bit encryption 
methods when 
collecting or 
transferring 
sensitive data such 
as credit card 
information.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Each Pegasus 
employee is 
generally subject to 
a confidentiality 
agreement, which 
would further 
restrict 
unauthorized 
disclosure of your 
personal 
information.</font></p>

Credit card numbers 
are used only for

<br>
<i><b>Human 
Resources 
Information</b></i><br>
Pegasus collects 
certain personal 
information about 
its employees in the 
European Union, 
which Pegasus uses 
solely in connection 
with Pegasus’ 
employment-related 
activities. Employee 
information may also 
be shared with 
Pegasus entities or 
third party service 
providers (such as 
Pegasus’ benefits 
providers) outside 
of the EU solely in 
connection with 
Pegasus’ 
employment-related 
activities. Pegasus 
has reasonable 
security measures to 
protect such 
personal 
information. Pegasus 
employees should 
contact their 
supervisor or the 
Human Resources 
department if they 
have more questions 
about their personal 
information, 
including their 
options regarding 
access and 
preferences.<br>

to this Privacy 
Statement, Pegasus

commercially 
reasonable efforts 
to post notice of 
such change prior to
