		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		        
        <p>
            Unless otherwise defined in this Policy, terms used in this Policy have the 
same meanings as in our Peg It Board Terms of Service, accessible at
<a href="http://pegitboard.com/tos">http://pegitboard.com/about/terms/</a>. As used 
in this Policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using 
cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other 
analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not 
limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, 
combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or 
among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</p>
<hr>
<p>Peg It Board, Inc. is the corporate name for Peg It Board. In this Policy, we will 
refer to Peg It Board, Inc. as “Peg It Board”, “our”, “us” or “we.” </p>
<p>We take your privacy seriously. We are providing this Policy to inform you of 
our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of 
information on our Service. We also want to inform you about your choices 
regarding information. If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know 
(see “How to contact us” section below).</p>
<p>Note that this Policy may be modified from time to time in our sole 
discretion, so check back frequently. We will notify you of any changes to the 
Policy by posting a new Policy and updating the “last modified” date at the top 
of this page.</p>
<h3>1. How we collect information</h3>
<p>We collect information in three basic ways:</p>
<ol>
	<li>We collect information that you voluntarily provide to become a 
	registered User of our Service, and when you use certain aspects of our 
	Service (e.g., entering an email address on a form to send an email from 
	your Peg It Board account).</li>
	<li>We collect information when you register to join Peg It Board by logging 
	into an account that you already have with certain third-party social 
	networking sites (“SNS”) (including, but not limited to, Facebook and 
	Twitter) via our Service. For example, our Service allows you to create an 
	account and login to the Service using your Facebook account credentials 
	through Facebook Connect. If you are not currently registered as a User on 
	the Service and you click on “Sign in Using Facebook,” you will first be 
	asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to 
	register and join Peg It Board.</li>
	<li>When you browse or use our Service, technological tools including “Log 
	Data” and “Cookies” collect certain information, as explained in the 
	following section.</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. What information we collect and how we use it</h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Personal Information.</strong> When you register with us through 
	the Service to become a registered User of Peg It Board, we will ask you for 
	certain information about you that can be used to contact or identify you 
	(“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include, but is not 
	limited to, your name, gender, profile photo, free-form biography, 
	location/hometown, website and email address. If you decide to create your 
	User account by logging into a SNS via the Service, you are using the 
	Personal Information you have already provided to the SNS (such as your 
	“real” name, email address and other information you make publicly available 
	via the SNS) to create your User account on our Service; the information we 
	collect may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS, so please 
	consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices. For example, by using Facebook 
	Connect, you are allowing Peg It Board to access the Personal Information in 
	your Facebook account pursuant to the Facebook Terms of Use regarding your 
	use of the Service via Facebook. <br>
	We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your 
	“Non-Identifying Information,” see below) to provide the Service to you. For 
	example:
            <ol>
				<li><strong>Account registration.</strong> We create your User 
				account for your use of the Service based upon the Personal 
				Information you provide.</li>
				<li><strong>Communications.</strong> We use your Personal 
				Information to contact you with Peg It Board newsletters, marketing 
				or promotional materials and other information that may be of 
				interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer 
				wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the 
				unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications 
				or update your “preferences” information in your account 
				settings. (See “Your choices regarding information,” below.)</li>
				<li><strong>Customer service.</strong> We use your Personal 
				Information to respond to your questions and/or inquiries.</li>
				<li><strong>Finding friends.</strong> You also have the option 
				to import your personal contacts (including email addresses of 
				friend lists via SNS) to the Service so that you can find your 
				friends on the Service, and your friends can find you on the 
				Service.</li>
				<li><strong>Emailing via a Peg It Board Account.</strong> As part of 
				the Service, Peg It Board Users may communicate with other 
				registered and non-registered Users through use of their 
				Peg It Board accounts. Where Users have selected the option of 
				adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the 
				message they create in the corresponding template will be sent 
				from Peg It Board to those email addresses on their behalf.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><span class="fakep"><strong>Non-Identifying Information.</strong> We 
	also collect other information that you provide as part of registration, the 
	operation, and personalization of your boards on Peg It Board that cannot 
	reasonably be used to identify or contact you (e.g., without limitation, age 
	and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”). Certain 
	Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal 
	Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, 
	combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you 
	to be personally identified or contacted. But the same pieces of information 
	are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or 
	combined only with other Non-Identifying Information (for example, your 
	viewing preferences)</span> We may combine your Personal Information with 
	Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from 
	other Peg It Board Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to 
	improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand 
	how our Service is used. We may also use the combined information without 
	aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product 
	to you according to your preferences or restrictions. </li>
	<li><strong>Mobile Software.</strong> Our Mobile Software allows Users to 
	access and use the Service from their mobile devices. From the Mobile 
	Software, you also have the option to identify the location of User Content 
	that you wish to upload to our Service. In addition, in the event that our 
	Mobile Software crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information 
	about your mobile device model, software version and device carrier, which 
	allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of 
	our Mobile Software. </li>
	<li><strong>Log Data.</strong> When you visit the Service, whether as a 
	registered User or a non-registered User just browsing, our servers 
	automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit 
	a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as the 
	browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our 
	Service, pages of our Service that you visit, the time spent on those pages, 
	information you search for on our Service, access times and dates, and other 
	statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the 
	Service and the Service’s technical administration, to increase our 
	Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our 
	Service to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is 
	collected so that when you visit the Service again, it will recognize you 
	and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other 
	information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to 
	verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process 
	their requests. </li>
	<li><span class="fakep"><strong>Cookies.</strong> Like many online services, 
	Peg It Board uses “cookies” on our Service to collect information. A cookie is a 
	small data file that we transfer to your computer or mobile device’s hard 
	disk. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize “persistent” 
	cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Service. 
	Second, we utilize “session ID” cookies to enable certain features of the 
	Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to 
	monitor aggregate usage by Peg It Board Users and web traffic routing on the 
	Service. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your 
	computer when you log off from the Service and then close your browser.</span> 
	You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting 
	cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you 
	visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all 
	portions of the Service or all functionality of the Service. (See “Your 
	choices regarding information,” below.)
        </li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Sharing of your information</h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Peg It Board Users.</strong> When you register through the Service 
	and submit Personal Information to create a profile or visual collection, 
	other Peg It Board Users will see your name. If you choose to provide additional 
	Personal Information in your profile, Peg It Board Users will see such 
	additional Personal Information, including, but not limited to, your photo, 
	location, website and biography. Providing additional Personal Information 
	is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to 
	have with Peg It Board Users. We recommend that you guard and refrain from 
	disclosing any information you consider sensitive and confidential.</li>
	<li><strong>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</strong> 
	We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal 
	Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and 
	Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and 
	other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not 
	contain your Personal Information.</li>
	<li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may employ third party companies 
	and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our 
	behalf, to perform Service-related services (e.g., maintenance services, 
	database management, web analytics and improvement of the Service’s 
	features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Service are used. These third 
	parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks 
	on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other 
	purpose.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Networking Sites.</strong> We may share the information 
	in your Peg It Board account (including your Personal Information) with the SNSs 
	that you have linked to your Peg It Board account. These third parties have 
	access to your Personal Information only for this purpose (unless the SNS 
	has received your Personal Information independently of the Service) and not 
	for other purposes.
            <ul>
				<li><strong>Facebook Connect and Twitter.</strong> We allow 
				Users to link their Facebook and Twitter accounts to our 
				Service. Users can then post recent activity on our Service back 
				to their Facebook and Twitter accounts. You will be prompted to 
				decide whether or not your activity on the Service will be 
				shared and disclosed on your Facebook/Twitter service. You can 
				disable the foregoing feature at any time by logging into your 
				profile and selecting the option to disable Facebook Connect 
				and/or Twitter. Further, you may be able to edit your privacy 
				settings for the content that you post which appears on 
				Facebook/Twitter by making selections in your “Edit Profile” 
				settings via the Service.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</strong> Peg It Board 
	cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties 
	to enforce and comply with the law. We can disclose any information about 
	you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in 
	our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims 
	and legal process including, but not limited to, subpoenas, to protect the 
	property and rights of Peg It Board or a third party, to protect the safety of 
	the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to 
	be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable 
	activity.</li>
	<li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> Peg It Board may sell, divest, 
	transfer, assign, share or otherwise engage in a transaction that involves, 
	some or all of our assets, including any or all of the information described 
	in this Policy, in the course of a corporate divestiture, merger, 
	acquisition, joint venture, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or any 
	other similar transaction or proceeding.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Your choices regarding information</h3>
<p>You have several choices regarding the use of information on our Service:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Email Communications.</strong> If you decide at any time that 
	you no longer wish to receive email communications from us, please follow 
	the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update 
	your “preferences” information in your account settings</li>
	<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> If you decide at any time that you no longer 
	wish to accept cookies from our Service for any of the purposes described 
	above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop 
	accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the 
	websites you visit. Consult your browser’s technical information. If you do 
	not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the 
	Service or all functionality of the Service. If you have any questions about 
	how to disable or modify cookies, please let us know at the contact 
	information provided below.</li>
	<li><strong>De-Linking SNS.</strong> If you decide at any time that you no 
	longer wish to have your SNS account (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) linked to 
	your Peg It Board account, then you may de-link the SNS account in the 
	“preferences” section in your account settings.</li>
	<li><strong>Changing or Deleting Your Information.</strong> All Users may 
	review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their User 
	account (including any imported contacts) by contacting us or by editing 
	their profile via the Service. If you completely delete all of your Personal 
	Information, then your User account may become deactivated. We will use 
	commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an 
	archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business 
	purposes. (For more information on how to control your User Content on the 
	Peg It Board Service, including information regarding the use and storage of 
	your User Content, please see the “Sharing Your Content” section in our
	<a href="http://pegitboard.com/tos">Terms of Service.</a>)</li>
</ol>
<h3>5. Links to other sites and services</h3>
<p>Our Service contains links to other third-party websites and online services. 
If you choose to visit another website or online service by clicking on a link, 
you will be directed to that third party’s website or online service. The fact 
that we may link to a website or online service is not an endorsement, 
authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is 
it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or 
practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites and online 
services, and these third parties may place their own cookies or other files on 
your computer and collect data or solicit Personal Information and 
Non-Identifying Information from you. Other sites and online services follow 
different rules regarding the collection, use and/or disclosure of Personal 
Information and Non-Identifying Information. We encourage you to read the 
privacy policies or statements of the other websites or online services you 
visit before providing any information or using such websites or services.</p>
<h3>6. How we store and protect information</h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Information Security.</strong> We care about the security of 
	your information. We use commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the 
	integrity and security of information collected and maintained through the 
	Service. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any 
	information you provide to us or guarantee that information on the Service 
	may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized 
	persons.</li>
	<li><strong>Phishing.</strong> Identity theft and the practice currently 
	known as “phishing” are of great concern to Peg It Board. Safeguarding 
	information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do 
	not request your credit card information, login information, or national 
	identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone 
	communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade 
	Commission’s <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">website</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Breach Notification.</strong> We will make any legally required 
	disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of 
	stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security 
	breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Service 
	in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar 
	as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any 
	measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the 
	reasonable integrity of the data system.</li>
	<li><strong>International Transfer .</strong> Your information may be 
	transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your 
	state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the
