This Privacy Policy applies to our pedigreeonline.com, allbreedpedigree.com, and pedigreequery.com websites ("Websites"). To make this notice easy to find, we make it available as a link in the footer of our Websites. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, so refer back often to read the most current version.</p>

    <p>Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it, as you agree to this Privacy Policy by using any of the Websites. <i>If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not use the Websites</i>. </p>

    <p>We may collect the following types of data about you when you use the Websites: 1. Personal Information; 2. Communication Information; 3. User Contribution Information; 4. Navigational Information; and 5. Payment Information.</p>

    <p><u>Personal Information</u> is information that you voluntarily submit to us and identifies you personally when you fill out forms on our Websites, and may also be included in the other types of data described below. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, address, phone number, email address, business name, and other information about you or your business when creating an account on the Websites, at the time of subscribing to any of our services, or when using our online support system. We may also ask you for information if we receive a complaint about you. Personal Information can also include information about any transactions, both free and paid, that you enter into on the Websites, and information about you that is available on the Internet, such as from Facebook, Twitter and Google, or publicly available information that we may acquire.</p>

    <p><u>Communication Information</u> is collected if you contact us using the online support system, or by direct email. We may keep a record of that correspondence. The information we collect will include the details of the messages you send and receive using our internal support service including, without limitation, the date/time you sent or received a message and the contents of that message.</p>

    <p><u>User Contribution Information</u> is collected when you add, edit, delete, or upload information to the Websites. Information we collect may include, but is not limited to, IP address, browser information, computer hardware and operating system information, text or images you might add, edit or delete, and account identifier information which can be used to link to your Personal Information.</p>

    <p>You are free to explore the Websites without entering any personal information about yourself. When you visit the Websites in this manner, we collect <u>Navigational Information</u>.</p>

    <p><u>Navigational Information</u> includes details of your visits to the Websites including, but not limited to, browser information, computer hardware and operating system information, geographical location data, IP address, length of visit, pages viewed, referral source, and other communication data. Although we do not correlate tracking information to individuals, some information collected, such as IP addresses, will be unique.

If you believe that we have collected information about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@pedigreeonline.com">info@pedigreeonline.com</a>, so that we may delete the information.</p>

    <h2>The Way We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>In addition to uses explained elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we use the <u>Personal Information</u> you provide to us to fulfill a subscription request that requires a payment, identify you for login purposes, identify you for support purposes, and to assist us in administering your user account. We also may send you information about our services or communicate with you about your account with us. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete a subscription payment or for complying with court orders or other law enforcement requests.</p>

    <p><u>Communication Information</u> is used for support services for the Websites, and to contact you about your account or our services from time to time. We may (but are not obligated to) view the contents of any email or message sent to us by you or others, whether or not you have viewed its contents.

    If you give us <u>Payment Information</u> such as credit card information, we use it solely to collect payment from you. We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf. For subscription management purposes, we do store the last 4 digits of your credit card number, as well as the expiration date.
