<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should 
first contact Olafur Tryggvason by <a href="mailto:oli@pedigreedatabase.com">
oli@pedigreedatabase.com</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Information Collection</h3>
<p>pedigreedatabase.com is the sole owner of the information collected on pedigreedatabase.com. 
pedigreedatabase.com collects information from our users at several different points on 
our Web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>In the areas of this Web site where a user must first complete a registration 
form.&nbsp; During registration a user is required to give contact information (such 
as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about 
services on our site for which he has expressed interest.&nbsp; It is optional for 
the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), 
and unique identifiers (such as, username and password), but encouraged so we 
can provide a more personalized experience on our site.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Information Use</h3>
<p>pedigreedatabase.com does <b>not</b> disclose any of its information to third party 
members.&nbsp; The information kept at pedigreedatabase.com is for the use of pedigreedatabase.com 
and none other.&nbsp; This includes selling pedigree data,&nbsp; pictures, user 
/ contact information or any other privately kept data. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user多s computer tied to information 
about the user.&nbsp; [Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally 
identifiable information while on our site.]&nbsp; We use [both] session ID cookies 
[and] persistent cookies.&nbsp; For the session ID cookie, once users close the 
browser, the cookie simply terminates.&nbsp; A persistent cookie is a small text file 
stored on the user多s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent 
cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;</p>
<p>pedigreedatabase.com only uses cookies to track logged in users&nbsp;&nbsp; By setting 
a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, 
thereby saving time while on our site.&nbsp; If users reject the cookie, they may 
still use our site.&nbsp; The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited 
in some areas of our site.&nbsp; For example, the user will not be able to 
participate in any information submission which requires the user to be logged 
in. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users 
to enhance the experience on our site and keep the user from having to log in 
every time he visits pedigreedatabase.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, 
advertisers).&nbsp; However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once 
we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>
<p>The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by online 
advertising brokers. Information about users多 visit to this site, such as number 
of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal 
information), is used to serve ads to users on this site. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by pedigreedatabase.com only and does 
not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.&nbsp; This includes internet 
protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), 
referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to 
analyze trends, administer the site, track user多s movement in the aggregate, and 
gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.&nbsp; IP addresses, etc. Are 
not linked to personally identifiable information.&nbsp; We use a tracking utility 
called Funnel Web that uses log files to analyze user movement.</p>
<h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>
<p>We <b>do not</b> employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web 
Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing 
us what content is effective.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique 
identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online 
movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs 
are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at 
the end of this sentence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Communications from the Site</h2>
<h3>Special Offers and Updates</h3>
<p>We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. 
Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, 
special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we 
present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the 
Choice and Opt-out sections.</p>
<h3>Service Announcements</h3>
<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related 
announcement.&nbsp; For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for 
maintenance we might send users an email.&nbsp; Generally, users may not opt-out of 
these communications, though they can deactivate their account.&nbsp; However, these 
communications are not promotional in nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Customer Service</h3>
<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services 
and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, 
in accordance with the users wishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sharing</h2>
<h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose 
personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief 
that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a 
court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h3>
<p>We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and 
advertisers.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not linked to any personally identifiable 
information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Third Party Advertisers</h3>
<p>pedigreedatabase.com shares Web site usage information about users with a reputable 
third party for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on 
this site and other sites.&nbsp; The information they collect and share through this 
technology is not personally identifiable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We <b>DO NOT </b>Share Personal Information with Third Parties]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>
<p>Our users are given the opportunity to `opt-out多 of having their information 
used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for 
information.&nbsp; For example, our order form has an `opt-out多 mechanism so users 
who buy a product from us, but don多t want any marketing material, can keep their 
email address off of our lists.&nbsp; This only applies to users which have 
registered. We do not keep any personally identifiable information on 
non-registered visitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, 
pedigreedatabase.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.&nbsp; 
We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the 
privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally 
identifiable information.&nbsp; This privacy statement applies solely to information 
collected by this Web site. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Surveys </h3>
<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys.&nbsp; 
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user 
therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.&nbsp; The 
requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and 
shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Anonymous Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or 
improving the use and satisfaction of this site.&nbsp; Users多 personally identifiable 
information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and 
choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, 
they may not use users多 personally identifiable information for any secondary 
purposes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tell-A-Friend</h3>
<p>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our 
site, we ask them for the friend多s name and email address.&nbsp; pedigreedatabase.com will 
automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.&nbsp; 
pedigreedatabase.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time 
email.&nbsp; The friend may contact pedigreedatabase.com at support@pedigreedatabase.com to request the 
removal of this information from our database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums</h3>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat 
areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by 
posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive 
unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users多 information.&nbsp; When 
users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is 
protected both online and off-line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can 
send an email to support@pedigreedatabase.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h3>
<p>If a user多s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, 
phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we 
provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users多 personally 
identifiable information. This can usually be done at the member information 
page or by emailing us at support@pedigreedatabase.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this 
privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our 
users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under 
what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp; </p>
