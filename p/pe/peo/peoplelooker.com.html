<h3>
Information Collected by PeopleLooker
</h3>
<p>
PeopleLooker is a database of publicly available sources of information aggregated for your convenience. Through PeopleLooker, Visitors can access certain materials posted to or made available through the Site as compiled, distributed, and displayed by PeopleLooker and other third-party content providers (“Third-Party Providers”) including, but not limited to, third-party websites or services that provide information about individuals (each, a “Search Subject”) that can be searched for and accessed through the Site (“PeopleLooker Checks”).
</p>
<p>
PeopleLooker gathers three types of information: information that you submit to us, information that is collected automatically about your usage of the Site, and information about Search Subjects.
</p>
<h3>
Information You Submit to PeopleLooker
</h3>
<p>
We collect information that you provide when you use the Site, including, but not limited to, when you submit an online application to become a PeopleLooker member (“Member”), which enables you to utilize a host of services made available to Members by and through the Site (“Member Services”); when you submit a request to opt out of PeopleLooker’s People Search results; when you conduct a PeopleLooker Check; or when you contact us with a question, comment, or request. This can include, but is not limited to, your: (a) e-mail address; (b) full name; (c) company name; (d) date of birth; (e) password; (f) mailing address; (g) credit card information; and (h) information associated with a Search Subject (such as a name, age, or address) that you use to conduct a PeopleLooker Check.
</p>
<h3>
Information Collected Automatically About Your Usage of the Site
</h3>
<p>
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this [to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality. </p>
<p>
When you visit the Site, we or our third-party service providers may use a "Cookie" – a small, text-only file that we save to your hard drive – or similar technologies to automatically collect and store non-personally-identifiable information about your usage of the Site such as your IP address, your browser type, the links and items you click on, ad impressions on your web browser, and the web pages you visit. Cookies enhance your experience at the Site, and are in many instances necessary for the provision of Member Services. For example, we use Cookies to store your password so you don’t have to enter it more than once, and to recognize you if you return to the Site using the same web browser.
</p>
<p>
If you do not want the Site to collect this information through Cookies, you may set your web browser to reject Cookies from the Site, or to inform you when a Cookie has been sent to your computer and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that Cookie.

These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. </p>
<p>
When you download and use the PeopleLooker Background Check App, we also may collect your mobile device’s unique identification number. We will not collect any precise geolocation information from you or your mobile device unless you expressly consent to such collection.
</p>
