<p>
PeopleAdmin is committed to protecting your privacy and earning your trust. This policy discloses our privacy practices for personal information our customers provide to us. This policy explains how we collect, use and safeguard our customers’ personal information. It is our intent to give our customers as much control as reasonably practicable over their privacy and personal information and the use we make of it in our business. We may, in our sole discretion, change this policy from time to time by posting a revised version on our web site (<a href="www.peopleadmin.com/privacy">www.peopleadmin.com/privacy</a>) or otherwise publicly disseminating it, so please check back from time to time.
</p>
<h4>What kinds of personal information does PeopleAdmin collect?</h4>
<p>
In general, you can visit PeopleAdmin on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>We ask for personal information when you become a registered user of a PeopleAdmin System, purchase our products or services, or register for a conference or event. For example, such information might include your name, address, telephone number, email address, and other information related to you or your business. You are required to register and receive a logon name to be able to access and use certain features of your institution’s PeopleAdmin System. We also request certain other optional information that will enable us to provide you with a more personalized experience when using the PeopleAdmin Site. We will let you know what information is optional, and you can decide whether or not you want to provide that information or to receive newsletters or third party correspondence.</li>
	<li>We ask for personal information from you during the course of discussing or providing our products and services.</li>
	<li>In the course of using our site, we automatically track certain information about you. This information includes what type of browser you are using, as well as the URL that you just came from and the next URL you go to, regardless of whether these URLs are on our Web site or not. It also includes your IP address. PeopleAdmin uses this information to, among other things, identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests.</li>
	<li>We ask for personal information when you enter a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion sponsored by PeopleAdmin or its partners.</li>
	<li>We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us refine and improve the design and layout of your institution’s PeopleAdmin System and the user experience.</li>
	<li>If you send us personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We also periodically ask users for feedback that we use to improve our service and products and add new features. If you respond to these requests, we may keep a record of your response.</li>
	<li>We also collect IP addresses for system administration.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How does PeopleAdmin use my information?</h4>
<p>
We collect personal information to give you a customized experience and to help PeopleAdmin understand its customers and prospective customers better. As stated in your institution’s Customer Service Agreement, PeopleAdmin will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>We use the personal information as necessary to provide you with our services.</li>
	<li>We do not access or use the personal information you store on our servers through the use of the PeopleAdmin System, except to provide support in connection with such services, to test, troubleshoot and improve our products and services, or as otherwise authorized or requested by you.</li>
	<li>We use the personal information you give us to provide you with up-to-date information about PeopleAdmin products and services.</li>
	<li>We may use your personal information to conduct surveys and research to improve our products and services.</li>
	<li>We may use the information we collect to notify you from time to time about important functionality changes to the Web site, new PeopleAdmin services and products, and special offers we think you may find valuable.</li>
	<li>We will deliver targeted advertisements to our customers using the personal information you give us and that we collect. We do not allow advertisers to have access to individual account information. These advertisements are usually promotional e-mails.</li>
	<li>We also research our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information you give us and the information we collect.</li>
	<li>We compile and analyze personal information on an aggregate or anonymous basis to model industry trends, do market analysis, and to publish industry research papers identifying trends in the marketplace. Such industry research papers contain aggregate and anonymous data only, and do not contain any personal information that can be used to identify you.</li>
	<li>We use the IP addresses we collect to report aggregate or anonymous information to our advertisers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can unsubscribe from receiving any advertisements or newsletters by sending an email with “REMOVE” in the subject line to: <img src="templates/jsn_epic/images/emailButton.png" name="E-mail: " alt="E-mail: " align="middle" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h4>Who collects information?</h4>
<p>
When you supply personal information to PeopleAdmin or on a PeopleAdmin System, you share that information only with PeopleAdmin and the institution for which the system was built unless you are specifically informed otherwise.  PeopleAdmin makes no claim to the information it collects on behalf of its customers and acts only as stewards of that data.  Should a PeopleAdmin customer share personal information with a 3rd party, this privacy policy does not cover the practices of those organizations.
</p>
<p>
When companies other than PeopleAdmin sponsor promotions, data collected on the PeopleAdmin Site in connection with these promotions may be shared with the sponsor.
</p>
<p>
If you leave your institution’s PeopleAdmin System using links to go to other third party Web sites, those third parties may gather information about you. This privacy policy does not cover the practices of those businesses.
</p>
<h4>Does PeopleAdmin share my information?</h4>
<p>
Other than as stated in this policy, PeopleAdmin does not disclose any of your personal information to third parties without your permission. Read the following sections to learn more.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Business partners, subcontractors and sponsors</b><br>
	PeopleAdmin may disclose your personal information to business partners, subcontractors or sponsors as PeopleAdmin deems necessary to provide products and services to you. Many promotions give you the chance to request additional information from the sponsors. When you ask for more information, you give PeopleAdmin permission to send your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. If you do not want any personal information to be shared with our business partners or sponsors, you may opt out by sending an email to

	<li><b>Third-party data and aggregate data</b><br>
	PeopleAdmin discloses aggregated or anonymous statistics (for example, the percentage of users from the western U.S.) to prospective partners and for other lawful purposes.</li>
	<li><b>Other situations</b><br>
	PeopleAdmin also may disclose your information where disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with our rights or property rights, the users' rights, or others’ rights. In the same way, PeopleAdmin will disclose information when we reasonably believe disclosure is required by law or to comply with a legal process served on PeopleAdmin. We may also disclose your personal information in the good faith belief that we must act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of your institution’s PeopleAdmin System, or the public.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do I have a choice about how my information is gathered, used and distributed?</h4>

Yes. When you log in or register with PeopleAdmin, you can choose to receive newsletters, information, and e-mails from PeopleAdmin and third parties. If you change your mind, you can simply email

<p>
Some of our promotions may request your e-mail address so that you can receive periodic updates about the status of the promotion. When you participate in these types of promotions, you will automatically receive promotion-related e-mail; however, you can choose the no-e-mail option that some promotions offer. Occasionally these promotion-related e-mail messages may include targeted advertisements.
</p>
<h4>What security precautions does PeopleAdmin take to protect me?</h4>
<p>
We have security measures in place to protect your personal information, including the use of industry-standard encryption technology and internal policies and restrictions regarding the storage of and access to your personal information.
</p>
<p>
Your PeopleAdmin account information and profile are password-protected so that you are the only one who has access to your personal information. You can edit your account information and profile by using your logon name and password. We recommend that you follow these guidelines to protect yourself:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do not tell anyone your password. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.</li>
	<li>Do not respond to unsolicited e-mail by giving your password, even if the e-mail claims to be from us. PeopleAdmin will never ask you for your password in this way.</li>
	<li>When you are done using the PeopleAdmin site, sign out of your account and close your browser window.</li>
</ul>
<p>
No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although we are committed to protecting your personal information, PeopleAdmin cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us or from our online services. Providing personal information to PeopleAdmin is done at your own risk.
</p>
<h4>What are cookies and how does PeopleAdmin use them?</h4>
<p>
Part of our customized service involves using “cookies” so that we can immediately recognize you, determine when you – or someone using the same browser you previously used – revisits the PeopleAdmin MOPAC Portal, and to provide a more personalized experience. A "cookie" is a chunk of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored by your browser on the hard drive of your computer. Your browser settings must be set to accept cookies before you can login or customize. Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to refuse them. PeopleAdmin does not use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer. This policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers on the PeopleAdmin Site.
</p>
<p>
PeopleAdmin uses cookies to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Locate your name and account information when you log in to our Web site so that you can access your account information. When you log in, the cookie is set, and when you sign-out, the cookie is modified.</li>
	<li>Estimate the size of our audience. Each browser that accesses PeopleAdmin is given a unique cookie, which is used to calculate how many people return to our Web site, compare the number of registered and unregistered visitors to our site, and use customer interests and behavior to target our advertisements.</li>
	<li>Help PeopleAdmin partners track visits and complete business transactions. This information is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail".</li>
	<li>Track the way you use our promotions, contests, and sales. When a PeopleAdmin-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie tracks the user’s progress through the promotion (for example, entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings).</li>
	<li>Measure the traffic to various areas of the PeopleAdmin Site. We measure the areas of the network of Web sites you visit and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. This research helps us understand the ways in which our customers are alike and the ways in which they differ. We may use this information to personalize the information and design in our Web site.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can make decisions about cookies. You can modify your browser preferences to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you decide to reject all cookies, you might not be able to access certain areas of the PeopleAdmin website or participate in PeopleAdmin services that require registration to participate.
</p>
<h4>What about the privacy of children?</h4>
<p>
PeopleAdmin is a general audience Web site and does not request the age of its customers. PeopleAdmin does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
