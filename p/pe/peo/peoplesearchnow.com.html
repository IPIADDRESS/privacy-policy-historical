				PeopleSearchNow.com takes your privacy seriously. This policy covers how we treat personal information that we collect and receive. By using our web site, you agree to the terms in this policy.  If you have any questions about this policy, please refer to the end of this policy for information about how to contact us.</p>

				<p><strong>Collection of Your Information</strong></p>

				<p>Unless you choose to provide it, we do not collect any of your personally identifiable information. You may choose to provide this information (i.e., your name and address or e-mail ID) so we may correspond with you, process an order, or provide you with a subscription or service. You may also give us your credit card details to buy a product or service from us.</p>

				<p>We also automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our web site. This information is limited to your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, and the referring web site address.</p>

				<p>We may send your computer a "cookie" to identify your Web browser when you use our site. A cookie is a small file that our servers send to your computer and which uniquely identifies your browser. We may use cookies to track and compile your browsing habits on our site, to delivery targeted advertisements, and to help customize your access to our site. We may also use "Web beacons," which are small graphic files that may be included in or attached to an email message or Web page, to track your browsing habits on our site and to know whether you have opened an email from us. We use the information we obtain from cookies and Web beacons for purposes such as verifying whether you have an account with us, tracking your visits to the Sites, customizing advertising content, and counting the unique visitors to our Sites. Most browsers allow you to disable cookies; however, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. To find out more about cookies, please visit <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie</a>.</p>

				<p>Our site may link to features and content on Web sites we do not own or operate. These sites may collect information about you, but we have no control over their collection practices. If you are visiting a third-party web site, we urge you to read its privacy policy to understand its policies regarding information collection, usage and disclosure.</p>

				<p>We have select partners who help us distribute on-line advertising. These companies may collect and use information about customers to help better understand the offers, promotions, and types of advertising that are most appealing to our customers. After the information is collected, it is aggregated so it is not identifiable to a specific individual.</p>

				<p><strong>Using Your Information</strong></p>

				<p>We use the information we collect for the purpose for which it was provided. We may use the personally identifiable information you provide us, in combination with other information about you from cookies and third-parties in order to provide you with a better user experience, develop new services, deliver targeted advertising, improve the quality of our existing services, and for internal business purposes.</p>

				<p>In addition, the information you provide us may be used, with your permission, by us and selected third parties for marketing purposes. Before we use it, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used for this purpose. Regardless of how you have registered with us and set up your account, you can elect not to receive any marketing messages from us by following the opt-out instructions provided in the email message we send to you. We honor opt-out requests within 10 business days. Please be advised that if you choose not to receive marketing communications, you will continue to receive communications regarding your transactions and Account with us (e.g., registration and purchase confirmation emails, and information about your Account, if applicable).</p>

				<p>Your personal information may also be required to be disclosed because we have been ordered to do so via judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.</p>

				<p><strong>Securing Your Information</strong></p>

				<p>We use reasonable security measures to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized use and disclosure while in our control. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to protect highly confidential personally identifiable information, such as credit card information, that is transmitted over the Internet. Despite our best efforts, however, no security measures are perfect, and we cannot guarantee that your information will be secure from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.</p>

				<p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>

				<p>Our web site and services are not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13. We do not target our web site or services to, or knowingly request, collect, use or share information from, children under the age of 13. As a result of fraud, error or action by others, it is possible that we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under the age of 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will promptly delete the information from our servers.</p>

				<p><strong>Changes to this Policy</strong></p>

				<p>We occasionally update this policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post substantive changes, we revise the "updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
