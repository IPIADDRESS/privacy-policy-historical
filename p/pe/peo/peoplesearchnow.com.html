<p class="description-page-block-title big"><strong>II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><span class="description-page-subtitle">Use of Information by Us.</span> We may use Information that we collect about you: (1) to provide you with information or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive; (2) to provide you with information
regarding new features, products or services; (3) to improve the PeopleSearchNow Applications or our Services and to customize your experience; (4) to contact you with regard to your use of the PeopleSearchNow Applications and, in our discretion, changes to the PeopleSearchNow
Applications and/or the PeopleSearchNow Applications’ policies; (5) for internal business purposes; (6) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information, and (7) as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span class="description-page-subtitle">Contacting You.</span> When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in
connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you about PeopleSearchNow using the information you provided to us. You
also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means you may be contacted in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use
of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p>
<p><span class="description-page-subtitle">Transactional Communications.</span> We may send you notices from time to time relating to your account or your orders. These may include order confirmations, invoices or customer service notifications. We may also send you
service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so; for instance, if our Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the delivery of a product is delayed or there is some service issue with something you may have ordered. You may not opt-out of receiving these
communications, which are not promotional in nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="description-page-subtitle">Service Providers.</span> We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the PeopleSearchNow Applications or administer activities on our behalf, such as processing payments. We may share your
information with these third parties for those limited purposes.</p>
<p><span class="description-page-subtitle">Electronic Promotional Offers.</span> We may send you promotional emails regarding special offers about our Services. You may choose not to receive our promotional communications or opt out of our sharing information with third
parties for marketing purposes by accessing "My Account" and updating your settings in “Email preferences”, or you may e-mail us by using our contact form located at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peoplesearchnow.com/contact" style="font:inherit">https://www.peoplesearchnow.com/contact</a>.
You may also click the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email. You may also close your account. After unsubscribing or closing your account, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another marketing mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the
future through a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. Unsubscribing from one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all marketing lists. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving promotional e-mails, we may continue to send
you electronic service or transactional notifications that are related to your account(s), orders or other services you have requested, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="description-page-subtitle">Co-branded Areas.</span> Certain areas on our PeopleSearchNow Applications may be provided to you in association with third parties such as sponsors or advertisers which provide products and or services, (“Co-Branded Areas”). Such
 Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party. If you elect to register for the products and/or services provided at these Co-Branded Areas, you either will be providing your Personal Information to both us and the third party or we might be providing your Personal Information
directly to the third party in order for that third party to fulfill their products and services directly with you. Your Personal Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy as well as the privacy policy and practices of such third party. We are not responsible for the
privacy practices of those third parties and we suggest you review the individual privacy policies of each company with whom you establish a relationship. You should consult the respective privacy policies of those third party sponsors or advertisers to learn more about their
privacy practices.</p>

Use or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose your information and/or communications in situations that we believe to be: (i) emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or
property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat; or (ii) your conduct on the PeopleSearchNow Applications or when using the Communication Services that we believe is inappropriate and inconsistent with generally accepted norms of behavior.</p>
<p><span class="description-page-subtitle">Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets.</span> In the event that we, or any of our businesses, are sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy
or receivership, personal information of our customers and visitors to our PeopleSearchNow Applications may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction. Information about our customers and registered users may also need to be disclosed in connection
