You agree that we may share your video viewing with or obtain information about your video viewing from third-party social media sites for two years or until you withdraw consent. The information we have access to from the third-party social media websites varies by website and is controlled by your privacy settings on that website and by your consent.  By associating an account managed by a third party with your OTD account and authorizing us to have access to this information, you agree that we may collect, use, and store information from these websites in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
