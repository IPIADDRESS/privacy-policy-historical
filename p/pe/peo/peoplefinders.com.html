        I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
    </div>
    <br>
    Information Provided Directly by You To PeopleFinders
    <br><br>
    <b>
        Registration Information.
    </b> We will collect personal information from you if you register with us or subscribe to our Services ("Personal Information"). Any information you provide before registering with us is not associated with you individually and is not retained by PeopleFinders unless you register with us. When you register you are required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, e-mail address, billing information and a password.
    <br><br>
    <b>
        Searching for people.
    </b> When you are searching for people, you may enter third party personal information such as their name, address, phone, email or social security number. We only use the data you input to provide you with a search request. We retain the results of your search requests for a period of time at our discretion but do not use that information for any other purpose and have no obligation to maintain such search results.
    <br><br>
    <b>
        Optional Information.
    </b> At various other points during your visit to PeopleFinders, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. The use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part. You have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our PeopleFinders Applications.
    <br><br>
    <b>
        Feedback.
    </b> In addition, during your visit to our Site, you may be asked to provide feedback, ideas, suggestions, and/or proposals (“Feedback”) with regard to our products and services.

    <br><br>
    Please Note:
    <br>
    If you choose to provide feedback that includes personal information, and we post your feedback on this or any other site, we will not include any personal information in our post.
    <br><br>
    <b>Billing Information.</b> While many products and services on our Site are provided free, some require payment from you by credit/debit card (“Billing Information”). We collect, and if you are purchasing a recurring billing subscription, we store Billing Information but this information is only shared with third parties who perform tasks required to verify and complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit/debit cards.

        II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <b>
        Use of Information by Us.
    </b> We may use Information that we collect about you: (1) to provide you with information or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive; (2) to provide you with information regarding new features, products or services; (3) to improve the PeopleFinders Applications or our Services and to customize your experience; (4) to contact you with regard to your use of the PeopleFinders Applications and, in our discretion, changes to the PeopleFinders Applications and/or the PeopleFinders Applications’ policies; (5) for internal business purposes; (6) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information, and (7) as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.
    <br><br>
    <b>
        Contacting You.
    </b> When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you about PeopleFinders using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means you may be contacted in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.
    <br><br>
    <b>
        Transactional Communications.
    </b> We may send you notices from time to time relating to your account or your orders. These may include order confirmations, invoices or customer service notifications. We may also send you service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so; for instance, if our Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the delivery of a product is delayed or there is some service issue with something you may have ordered. You may not opt-out of receiving these communications, which are not promotional in nature.
    <br><br>
    <b>
        Service Providers.
    </b> We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the PeopleFinders Applications or administer activities on our behalf, such as processing payments. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes.
    <br><br>
    <b>
        Electronic Promotional Offers.
    </b> We may send you promotional emails regarding special offers about our Services. You may choose not to receive our promotional communications or opt out of our sharing information with third parties for marketing purposes by accessing "My Account" and updating your settings in “Email preferences”, or you may e-mail us by using our contact form located at <a href="/About/Help">http://www.peoplefinders.com/About/Help</a>. You may also click the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email. You may also close your account. After unsubscribing or closing your account, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another marketing mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. Unsubscribing from one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all marketing lists. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving promotional e-mails, we may continue to send you electronic service or transactional notifications that are related to your account(s), orders or other services you have requested, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.

    <b>
        Co-branded Areas.
    </b> Certain areas on our PeopleFinders Applications may be provided to you in association with third parties such as sponsors or advertisers which provide products and or services, (“Co-Branded Areas”). Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party. If you elect to register for the products and/or services provided at these Co-Branded Areas, you either will be providing your Personal Information to both us and the third party or we might be providing your Personal Information directly to the third party in order for that third party to fulfill their products and services directly with you. Your Personal Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy as well as the privacy policy and practices of such third party. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties and we suggest you review the individual privacy policies of each company with whom you establish a relationship.
