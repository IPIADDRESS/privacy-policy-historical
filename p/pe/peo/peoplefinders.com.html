  <p>Use of cookies and other technologies to collect information. We use various technologies 
   to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our web site.</p>

  <ul class="bluecheck">
    <li><strong>Information collected automatically.</strong> We automatically collect

     your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted 
     cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see  "<a href="#cookies">Cookies</a>", 
     below), and the referring web site address. <br><br></li>
     
    <li><a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a><strong>Cookies</strong>. We employ "cookies" to 
     help customize your access to our web site, and also for the delivery of targeted 
     advertisements. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information 
     about you. Through the use of a cookie, we may collect personal information about your 
     online activity on our web site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and 
     the searches you conduct on our web site. Cookies have many benefits to enhance your 
     experience at our web site and to facilitate the receipt of targeted advertisements. For 
     instance, by setting a cookie on our web site, you do not have to log in a password more

    <li><strong>Other Technologies.</strong> For the purpose of formatting and delivering future 
     marketing or sales campaigns (either electronic or direct), we may employ pixel tags (also 
     known as clear gifs) to track: 1) the pages that our users visit on affiliate and/or partner 
     web sites; and 2) user opens of, and clicks on, our targeted e-mail advertising. We reserve 
     the right to employ user source information, including applicable category and interest(s), 
     for the marketing of targeted e-mail messages on behalf of our clients. This source information 
     may be shared with our third party marketing partners, and we reserve the right to retain 
     cookie and pixel tag data indefinitely.<br><br></li>
     
    <li><strong>Information collected by third-parties.</strong> We may also work with other 
     businesses to bring select retail opportunities to our users from us, our partner web sites, 
     or our marketing partners, including affiliated third party advertisers. These e-mail 
     campaigns may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect aggregate information 
     about users who view or interact with the e-mail marketing material. Users may remove 
     themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the unsubscribe options that are present 
     at the end of each e-mail we send on behalf of the list owner. Unsubscribing from one list

   <p>Personal information. We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated 
    below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal 
    information shared. We may share personal information with:</p>

          <ul class="bluecheck">
            <li><strong>Authorized service providers</strong>: We may share your personal 
              information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services 
              on our behalf. These services may include sending direct and electronic mail, 
              removing duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data, providing marketing 
              analysis, and supporting our web site functionality. These service providers may 
              have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not 
              permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. <br><br></li>
              
            <li><strong>Business partners</strong>: We may collect, sell, or share any personal 
              information you enter on our web site or provide to us in some other manner with your 
              consent, including via e-mail marketing. We may work with other businesses to bring 
              select retail opportunities to our users via e-mail marketing campaigns by us, or our 
              partner web sites/co-brands, or our marketing partners, including affiliated third 
              party advertisers. We will not share your personal information for third party 
              marketing purposes with these third parties without your consent.  The other businesses 
              we work with may include: (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, 
              including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) 
              e-mail marketers; and (c) telemarketers. When you open, preview or click on the 
              advertising portion of our e-mails and/or those of our marketing partners and/or 
              affiliates, you have agreed to the terms set forth in our Privacy Policy, and agree 
              that as a function of opening, previewing or clicking on the advertising portion of 
              our e-mails, you will receive new or additional marketing communications from us. 
              These e-mail campaigns may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect 
              information about users who view or interact with the e-mail marketing material. There

              These third-party web sites may independently solicit and collect information, 
              including personal information from you, and, in some instances, provide us with 
              information about your activities on those web sites. We recommend that you consult the 
              privacy statements of all third-party web sites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" 
              link typically located at the bottom of the web page you are visiting.<br><br></li>

              e-mail/postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services that may be of

            <li><strong>E-mail lists.</strong> Users may remove themselves from a specific mailing 
              list by utilizing the unsubscribe options that are present at the end of each e-mail we 
              send on behalf of the list owner. Unsubscribing from one list will not automatically 
              unsubscribe a user from all lists.<br><br></li>

            <li><strong>Other Situations</strong>. We also may disclose your information: 
            <ul type="circle" style="list-style-image: none;">

          <p>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy 
           policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will 
           govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with 
           those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about 
           their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the web sites of those third parties. 
           These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.</p>

          <p>Aggregated and non-personal information. We reserve the right to provide aggregate or group 
           data about PeopleFinders.com users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that 
           describes the demographics, usage, or characteristics of PeopleFinders.com participants as a 
           group, without disclosing personally identifiable information. By opening a PeopleFinders.com 
           account, you agree to allow PeopleFinders.com to provide such aggregate data to third parties. 
           By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication 
           to any third party when PeopleFinders.com, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to 
           be appropriate. </p>
          
          <p>If you use a blog or post your story testimonial on this Web site, you should be aware that 
           any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other 
           users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible 
           for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. All users who 
           have posted testimonials on the site have given their permission to post their personal information 
           on the site and are able to have their information removed by <a href="http://www.peoplefinders.com/contact-us.aspx">contacting us via email</a>. </p> 

          <p><a name="d" id="A1"></a><strong>4. Links to Other Sites</strong> </p>
          
          <p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be 
           aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.</p>
          
          <p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each

          <p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p>

          
          <p><a name="d" id="d"></a><strong>5. Third-party reports</strong> </p>

          <p>The information contained in our reports comes from proprietary sources and 
           third party suppliers, and is beyond our control to edit, modify, or change. 
           You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly 
           or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in 
           connection with use of or reliance on any such information.</p>

          <p><a name="e" id="de"></a><strong>6. How you can access your information</strong> </p>

          <p>If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update 
           your personal information online by logging into your account 
           <a href="http://www.peoplefinders.com/reports/">http://www.peoplefinders.com/reports/</a>. 
           You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More 
           information about how to contact us is provided below.</p>
          
          <p>You can opt-out of having your information shared with third parties when you 
           first signup. You can also update your preferences accessing โMy Accountโ and 
           updating your settings, or by <a href="http://www.peoplefinders.com/contact-us.aspx">contacting us via email</a>.</p>

          <p><a name="f" id="f"></a><strong>7. Your choices about collection and use 
            of your information</strong> </p>

          <p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result 
           in you being unable to use certain features of our web site because such information 
           may be required in order for you to have personalized recommendations presented to 
           you; register as a user; purchase products or services; ask a question; or initiate 
           other transactions on our web site. </p>

          <p>At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional e-mails 
           or newsletters from us by unsubscribing. In every marketing e-mail communication we 
           send, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from 
           that specific marketing program by simply clicking the hyperlink provided and 
           following the instructions provided. We attempt to process all such unsubscribe 
           requests in a prompt fashion. You can also unsubscribe by logging into โMy Accountโ, 
           โEmail Preferencesโ and Opting out of receiving promotional emails. However, after 
           unsubscribing, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another marketing 
           mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a 
           different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. We can guarantee, 
           however, that if you should ever receive another e-mail marketing communication from 
           us, you will be able to remove your e-mail address via the unsubscribe hyperlink. 
           Unsubscribing from one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from 
           all marketing lists. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship 
           e-mail communications, such as service announcements and administrative notices, 
           without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</p>

          <p><a name="g" id="g"></a><strong>8. How we protect your personal 
            information</strong> </p>

          <p>We take industry appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and 
           procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized 
           access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access 
           personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. 
           When users submit information at our web site, their information is protected both 
           online and offline. The privacy of your personal information is very important to 
           us and access to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the 
           public. The servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept 
           in a secure physical environment. We have security measures in place to protect the 
           loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Currently, 
           we use Secure Socket Layer Software ("SSL") to protect data and to secure any 
           transactions. SSL encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and 
           addresses as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although 
           we take every reasonable technological precaution available to protect your data, 
           no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, 
           we cannot warrant that your information will be absolutely secure and any transmission 
           of data at or through our web site is at your own risk. </p>

          <p>Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's web site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> 
           for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>

          <p>To the extent that user credit card-specific information (or alternate user payment 
           method information, such as PayPay, Google Check-Out, etc.) is collected by us and/or 
           any of our partners and affiliates, this information will be kept in confidence and will 
           not be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without the 
           user's prior informed consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PeopleFinders.com, our 
           partners, affiliates and/or subsidiaries reserve the right to share with third parties 
           the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific users but we will 
           not share the specific credit card information with third parties without the user's 
           prior informed consent.</p>

          <p>We value your privacy and, upon request, can block your records from being shown on 
           peoplefinders.com from databases we control. We are unable to remove you from databases 
           operated by third parties. To do so, you should contact us by writing a letter, signed 
           by you (we do not accept any unsigned requests or substitute service), giving us your:</p>

   days. If you include a self-addressed envelope, we will send back a letter confirming that the 
   opt-out was completed.</p>

  <p>This information will be kept confidential and is used to ensure complete suppression of 
   your records. Or, if you would prefer, there is an online service that will remove you from
