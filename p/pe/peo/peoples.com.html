People's Bank knows how important it is to protect the confidentiality of the
information our customers and web site visitors provide us.  We have described
below our policies to protect your online privacy.  In addition, People’s
maintains appropriate security standards and procedures regarding unauthorized
access to customer information.  If you have any questions or concerns after
reading the information below, please  
<a href="http://www.peoples.com/doc/email.htm"><b>Contact Us</b></a> and
we'll be happy to explain further.
<p>
<b>What are the restrictions on the disclosure of account information?</b>
</p><p>
People’s will not reveal specific information about your accounts or other
personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their
independent use, except for the exchange of information with reputable
information reporting agencies to maximize the accuracy and security of such
information or in the performance of bona fide corporate due diligence, unless
(1) the information is provided to help complete a transaction initiated by
you; (2) you request it; (3)the disclosure is required by/or allowed by law
(e.g. subpoena, investigation of fraudulent activity, etc.); or (4) you have
been informed  about the possibility of disclosure for marketing or similar
purposes through a prior communication and you are given the opportunity to
decline (i.e. "opt out").

</p><p>
<b>When is information collected about my online activity?</b>
</p><p>
<i>Online Banking, Online Trading, and Account Applications</i>
</p><p>
When you use any of our People's Online services or apply online for any
products and services, People's will have access to your information.  This
information is retained on our systems in order to provide you with the services
you have requested.
</p><p>
<i>Financial Tools and Calculators</i>
</p><p>
If you use any of the financial tools, calculators or questionnaires on our
web site, you will provide some level of information.  This information may
be retained by the provider of the tool, calculator or questionnaire.  This
information will only be used by People's to provide you with services you
have requested or are likely to be interested in. 
</p><p>
<i>E-mail and Forms</i>
</p><p>
Whenever you communicate with us via Internet e-mail or forms on our web site,
we will retain the content of the form or e-mail, the e-mail address and our
response.  This allows us to retain an audit trail of our contact and provide
you with the product, service or information you may have requested.
</p><p>
<i>General</i>
</p><p>
Whenever your browse our site, non-personal information about you is recorded
by People's Internet servers.  This information is used primarily to provide
an enhanced online experience. Information tracked may include, but is not
limited to the type of operating system in use (e.g., Macintosh, Windows),
the domain name and the type of browser being used(e.g., Netscape, Internet
Explorer, etc.).  This information may be used in internal reviews of the
number of visitors to the site, but only in an aggregate and
non-personally-identifiable form. E-mail addresses and other personally
identifiable data about visitors to this site are known only when voluntarily
submitted.
</p><p>
<i>Cookies</i>
</p><p>

Cookies are lines of text that are transmitted to your web browser when you click on a link.  Your browser stores the information on your hard drive and when you return to that site later, the "Cookie" is transmitted back to the server that originally sent it to you.  Cookies provide a way for a server to recall a previous request from a particular web browser. People's does use "Cookies" in our online trading and banking sections of the website, to help keep track of your online session.  The cookie is used only for administrative purposes and does <b>not</b> contain any sensitive information such as your password, account number, etc. 

</p><p>
<b>How does People's Bank use my online information?</b>
</p><p>
People's holds its customer information to the same degree of confidentiality
as other financial records.  Therefore, we keep completely confidential any
information our customers may provide us, no matter what the source of that
information except as otherwise stated in this statement.
</p><p>
In the normal course of business, People's may use your information to
provide you with products and services you have requested.  We may use
information to positively identify you, to communicate with you, to help us
respond to your questions and to understand which People's products and
services will best meet your needs.  This may require communicating with
reputable third parties from whom we obtain certain services.

</p><p>
<b>Do you sell online information to others outside of
People's Bank?</b>
</p><p>
In the normal course of business, People's does not sell online customer
information to a third party for the purpose of solicitation nor do we
provide such information to a third party for its own, independent use.
We may, however, share information with third parties in order to deliver
products and services which you have requested and in order to communicate
with you about People's Bank, its products and its services.  If your
personally identifiable information is provided to a third party People’s
requires that the third party adhere to similar privacy principles that
provide for the keeping such information confidential. 
</p><p>
<b>Can I update or correct information gathered about me online?</b>
</p><p>
Information specific to any of your account relationships or financial
services can be updated or changed at your request.  Questions regarding
corrections of this nature should be directed to your local People's 
branch, or you can contact us via
<a href="http://www.People's.com/doc/email.htm"><b>Email</b></a> and we
will be happy to help you.
</p><p>
<b>Can I "opt out" of having any information collected?</b>
</p><p>
People's has no formal way to ensure that no information will be collected
about your online activity, since any information which can be
tracked to the individual customer is only given <i><b>voluntarily</b></i>
via use of our e-mail forms, or our online transaction and account information
systems. But also see next paragraph.
</p><p>
<b><i>Special Notice for People's Credit Card customers</i></b>
</p><p>
People's Bank Credit Card holders may have their name, address and certain
other account information shared with reputable corporations whose valuable 
products or services may be of interest to you.  Any sharing or use of information will
be made under conditions designed to safeguard the privacy of the information.
If you would rather not have this information disclosed and transaction
information used by others, you may so inform People's ("opt out") by writing to the
address specified in the materials which were sent to you with your 
credit card.
