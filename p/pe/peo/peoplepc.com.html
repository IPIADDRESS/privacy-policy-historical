<p><a name="useofppcsites"></a><b>Your use of the PeoplePC Sites.</b> In order to provide better service to you, PeoplePC monitors usage of the PeoplePC Sites. For instance, we may track hits to each of the pages in our site, the access numbers you are using, the length and time of your Internet sessions. PeoplePC and its e-commerce partners may also collect data on transactions you engage in on the PeoplePC sites and partner sites. We may share aggregated statistical information with advertisers, business partners, sponsors or other third parties, but none of them receives individual Personal Data about you collected at our sites. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of visitors visited a certain area on a Web site but we would not disclose any information that would identify those individuals. We share this information only on an aggregate, anonymous basis and never on an individual basis, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><a name="infoppcspecialfeatures"></a><b>3. Information Related to PeoplePC's Special Features.</b></p>
<p><a name="peoplepaltoolbar"></a><b>PeoplePal Toolbar.</b> The PeoplePal Toolbar is installed as part of the PeoplePC software installation and automatically appears along with the Internet Explorer toolbar. It does not intentionally interfere with any other software program on your computer. URL visits and search queries made using the toolbar are not stored on our servers and are not transmitted to any third party. PeoplePC may track and statistically analyze the installation history and usage of the PeoplePal toolbar and its buttons in order to improve the functionality, content, or quality of the Toolbar. While you have the PeoplePal Toolbar installed, new versions may automatically be downloaded and installed on your computer. This keeps your software current and lets you use new features as soon as they are available.</p>
<p><a name="peoplepages"></a><b>PeoplePages.</b> PeoplePages is a feature that allows you to create a special page on which you can voluntarily post information about yourself, including Personal Data. Your PeoplePage will be available to anyone surfing the PeoplePages site, including non-PeoplePC members. By posting Personal Data on your PeoplePage, you are assuming the risk that persons accessing the PeoplePages site may use or misuse such information. PeoplePC will not be responsible or liable for such use or misuse. In addition, PeoplePC may feature your personal PeoplePage (as one of our "Featured Pages" or otherwise) on the PeoplePages site. Information you provide on your PeoplePage may also be used to offer you an improved, more personalized PeoplePC experience.</p>
<p><a name="infovendors"></a><b>4. Information Exchanged with Our Vendors.</b></p>
<p>Some PeoplePC products and services are offered to Members in conjunction with third party vendors. For example, stock quotes and horoscopes on your PeoplePC home page are provided by a third party vendor. Vendors may need to create an account for you within their systems in order to provide you with their services. To allow this, we must pass on information about you to them. Vendors may also need to collect and maintain your personal information to provide continuous service. Our third party vendors have agreed to use your personal information only to perform their functions as PeoplePC vendor-partners. Our core partners include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telecommunications and email vendors who work with us to establish and manage member accounts, fulfill contest prizes and promotional rewards and administer surveys; and</li>
<li>Third party reporting service providers who collect anonymous usage information on our web site through the use of cookies or use clear gifs for the purpose of tracking your initial registration, changes in account status and addition of account services.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="infomerchant"></a><b>5. Information Exchanged with Merchant Partners.</b></p>
<p>Once you are a Member, you may enjoy special deals through our merchants who wish to make special offers to PeoplePC Members. We may share with merchant partners aggregate information about PeoplePC Members.</p>
<p>We may also from time to time make your contact information available so that merchants may tell you directly about offers that you might find of interest. When we do so, we will typically use a third party fulfillment house that has agreed to keep the contact information confidential and to use the information only for the purpose of conducting the mailings in question. We will not give your contact information directly to merchants, nor make the information available to any third party for unrestricted use.</p>
<p><a name="infopartners"></a><b>6. Information Exchanged with Other Partners.</b></p>
<p>Many PeoplePC Members have co-branded Home Pages (also known as Personal Start Pages) that are co-sponsored by non-affiliated partners. PeoplePC may share non-identifying and aggregate consumer information with such partners in order to more effectively market our co-branded products or services offered to our Members.</p>
<p>If you have become a Member through a program sponsored by your employer or an entity with which you are affiliated (such as a club, association, frequent flyer or rewards program), you may be asked to provide your membership number to us so we may validate your eligibility for the program and also notify the partner that you have become a Member.</p>
<p>We may also give your name and contact information to such employer or entity so that it may communicate with you. We will not share any other information about you or your activities on the Internet with your employer or entity with which you are affiliated.</p>
<p><a name="general"></a><b>7. General.</b></p>
<p><a name="Security"></a><b>Security.</b> Our sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We use commercial industry-standard methods to protect your information from unauthorized access. Among other techniques, we store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location. There is no such thing as perfect security, and whatever the level of security, it is always possible that security breaches could occur. PeoplePC is not responsible for damages caused by the intentional wrongful actions of others that result in a breach of security.</p>
<p><a name="childrensprivacy"></a><b>PeoplePC's commitment to children's privacy.</b> Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us.
