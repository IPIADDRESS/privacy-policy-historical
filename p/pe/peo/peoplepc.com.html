        Privacy Policy</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Your 
        Privacy Matters to PeoplePC! </i></b><br>
        At PeoplePC, we know how important privacy is.* We want to protect your 
        individual privacy, while giving you the most benefit from your PeoplePC 
        membership. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>As a 
        PeoplePC Member...</i></b> <br>
        When you become a member of PeoplePC, you request an array of valuable 
        services from us. In order to provide you with those services, we need 
        to learn more about you. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">By joining 
        PeoplePC, you add one more person's worth of clout to our growing community 
        of savvy, forward-looking members. (Thanks!) Banded together, PeoplePC 
        members command the same marketplace power that large corporations, bulk 
        buyer's clubs and special-interest groups enjoy. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">In order to give 
		members a complete membership package - a new computer and
		unlimited Net access with email and more - we've carefully chosen a few
		partner companies we believe in and brought their services together. To
		seamlessly offer you these core companies' services and products, we must
		pass on selected member contact information to them, so that they can create
		an account for you within their systems. For example, you will need to
		provide financial information to us to qualify for the financing of the
		PeoplePC computer system - and we'll pass this information on to our
		financing partner. But we will never share that information with any other
		partners (or anyone else) without your express consent. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">
	    Our core partners include: our financial partners who provide financing for
		our PCs (and need credit information), our telecommunications and email
		partners who work with us to establish and manage member accounts, and our
		PC manufacturer and warranty service partners who require product
		registration information to fulfill warranty obligations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">Once you're 
        a member, you will enjoy special deals through our merchant partners. 
        As a tool to leverage great shopping values for you, we collect information 
        about PeoplePC members as a group and share this information with our 
        partners. We only share anonymous descriptions of the PeoplePC membership 
        as a whole. But except when you give your express consent, or when we 
        are providing services you have requested, we'll never give or sell merchants 
        information about you as an individual (who you are, what you like or 
        how to get in touch with you). The only person who can decide what merchant 
        partners know about you individually is you. </font>
      </p><p> 
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Visiting 
        PeoplePC Web sites... </i></b><br>
        When you visit PeoplePC's Web sites, we may collect information about 
        you that does not identify you as an individual. For example, we might 
        track which Web sites you visit and save this information in the form 
        of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies are stored on your computer hard 
        drive, not on our site, but allow us to follow the paths of users across 
        our sites. Cookies just track your Web activity - they cannot find out 
        your name or phone number. They do not spy on you, and they cannot breach 
        your hard drive and steal information. Cookies can help us provide you 
        with information targeted to your interests, and they allow us to better 
        understand how you like to use our site. You are always free to decline 
        our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our sites may not 
        work optimally in that case. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">From time 
        to time, we'll share aggregated (collective) information about our visitors 
        or membership as a group, or generate aggregate reports and market research. 
        These reports will not identify individual members. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">We won't collect 
        any personally identifying information about you on our sites (such as 
        your name, mailing address, or telephone number) unless you voluntarily 
        submit it to us. For example, you might choose to register your email 
        address with us so we can notify you of future offerings. We won't share 
        this data with anyone without your express consent. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Our 
        ongoing commitment to your privacy </i></b><br>
        Whether you're a member or just a visitor to the site... </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">We'll use 
        industry-standard methods to protect your information from unauthorized 
        access. Among other techniques, we store such information on a computer 
        behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and we restrict the number 
        of employees internally who can access such data. Please be aware, of 
        course, that there is no such thing as perfect security - on or off the 
        Internet. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">We may give 
        you the chance to opt in to merchant mailing lists or preregister on their 
        sites for faster shopping. These are options that you may take or leave 
        at your discretion. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">Keep this 
        in mind about sites that you reach through links from our services, sites 
        we cobrand with, or our partners: Each separate company has its own privacy 
        policies and practices and may market to you accordingly. Please link 
        with caution and pay attention to the policies and practices of the businesses 
        you patronize. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">When you give 
        us your information, we will offer you a reasonable way, when possible, 
        to review your information and either change or remove such data. If such 
        information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure 
        that corrections or deletions will reach the other databases. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">If you wish 
        to have information you provided to us online removed from our records, 
        please contact us at the email address below. We'll use all reasonable 
        efforts to ensure that your information is removed from our records. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">We request 
        that people under 18 do not give us any personally identifiable information, 
        such as name, address, or telephone number. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">If you have 
        concerns or questions about your privacy as a PeoplePC member or on PeoplePC's
