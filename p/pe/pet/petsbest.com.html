         This Web site is owned by Petsbest.com, a division of General Fire and Casualty
         and its affiliates ("General Fire").</p>
      <p>
         General Fire provides unconditional Internet access only and does not control any
         third-party material from authorized or unauthorized externally linked Web sites

         Privacy Policy Statement</h2>
      <h3>
         HOW WE PROTECT AND USE CUSTOMER INFORMATION</h3>
      <p>
         We safeguard the security and integrity of customer information. We are committed
         to protecting the security and integrity of customer information through procedures
         and technology designed for this purpose. For example: We limit employee access
         to customer information to those who have a business reason to know this information.
         Employees are required to honor our code of conduct, which includes standards to
         protect customer confidentiality. They are subject to disciplinary action if they
         fail to do so. We maintain policies and procedures covering the proper physical
         security of workplaces and records. Our physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards
         meet or exceed federal standards regarding the protection of customer information.
         We require independent contractors and outside companies who work with us to adhere
         to strict privacy standards through their contracts with us.
      </p>
      <p>
         We use technological means (such as backup files, virus detection and eradication
         software, firewalls, and other computer software and hardware) to protect against
         unauthorized access or alterations to customer data.</p>
      <p>
         General Fire has prepared the following Privacy Policy Statement to describe our
         policy regarding General Fire's collection, storage and use of information which

      <p>
         For each visitor to our Web site ("User"), our Web server will automatically recognize
         the User's domain name, but not the User's e-mail address. General Fire collects
         and stores the domain name, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us
         via e-mail, the aggregate information on the Web pages that Users access or visit,
         and any and all information volunteered by the User, such as survey information
         and/or information we seek for site registration or security purposes including
         information entered by the User for policy applications including financial information.
         We will keep financial information (such as credit card and bank account information)
         in our files for future billing of policy premiums as agreed to by the User when
         applying for policies. The User information collected by General Fire will not be
         shared with organizations which are not affiliated with General Fire unless otherwise
         noted below.
      </p>
      <p>
         Users who supply us with their postal address, e-mail address or telephone numbers
         on-line can expect General Fire to share that information with General Fire's affiliates,
         its agents or brokers. As such, these Users may receive periodic mailings from General
         Fire, its affiliates, its agents or brokers with information regarding new products
         and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please
         indicate this choice in your on-line communication and General Fire will remove
         your name from the list it shares with its affiliates, its agents or brokers.

         read it. This secure session helps protect the safety and confidentiality of your
         information. From our web sites, we do not knowingly collect or use personal information
         from children under 13 without containing verifiable consent from their parents.

         only use that information to respond directly to that child, seek parental consent,
         or provide parental notice. We are not responsible for the data collection and use
         practices of nonaffiliated third parties to which our web sites may link.</p>
