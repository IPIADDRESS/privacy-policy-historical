      <h2>What Are Your Choices About How We Use and Share Your Information?</h2>
      <p>
        We strive to provide you with choices regarding the information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to give you the following controls over your information: </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tracking Technologies</b>. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. For further information about how to do so, please refer to your browser “help” tool, or see www.allaboutcookies.org. Note that if you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our website may be inaccessible or not function properly. You may also be able to opt out of mobile advertising identifiers and other non-cookie technologies. Note that, even if you opt out, these tracking technologies may still collect data and you will still see ads, but they will not be targeted based on the information collected from you. At this time, we do not respond to web browser “do not track” signals. If you would like to learn more about your ability to limit the information automatically shared with us and with third-party advertisers, visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Promotional Offers from Petstablished</b>. If you do not wish to have your contact information used by Petstablished to promote our own or third parties' products or services, you can opt-out by sending us an email stating your request to support@petstablished.com. If we have sent you a promotional email, the email will have an “unsubscribe” feature that will allow you to opt-out of receiving future email distributions.
      </p>

      <h2>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</h2>
      <p>
        You may send us an e-mail at support@petstablished.com to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete all of your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you delete your User Contributions from the Services, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Services users. Proper access and use of information provided on the Services, including User Contributions, is governed by our Terms of Use.
      </p>

      <h2>How Is Your Information Kept Secure?</h2>
      <p>
        We have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls and will be backed up on at least a weekly basis. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.</p>
      <p>
        The safety and security of your information also depends on you. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Services like the message boards or forums. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Services.</p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Services. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services.</p>

      <h2>What If There Are Changes to Our Privacy Policy?</h2>

If we make material changes to how we treat your personal information, we will notify you by e-mail to the e-mail address specified in your account, if you have one. The date the Privacy Policy was last updated is identified at the bottom of this page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date, active and deliverable e-mail address for you and for periodically visiting our Services and this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.</p>
