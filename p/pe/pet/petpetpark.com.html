               					<b>Introduction</b>
						<br><br>
						Petpetpark.com is committed to providing a fun, entertaining, and safe Web site for people of all ages. We are dedicated to safeguarding any personal information collected online and to helping parents and children learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet. To this end, we ensure that our privacy policy and our information practices adhere to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Principles. Because many of the visitors to this site are children, we take special measures to help children protect their privacy while online. For example, we do not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity, and we take efforts to prevent children from posting contact information. This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and inform you as to: (1) the kinds of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") we collect from visitors of petpetpark.com (the "Site"); (2) how that information is collected; (3) how we use Personal Information; (4) the circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third parties; (5) how you can access, update or delete any Personal Information collected about you by us; and (6) the mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information. As we continue to offer our visitors new and different types of content and services, we may modify our practices from time to time. However, we will treat all personal information we collect in accordance with the privacy notice in effect at the time the information is collected. This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement"). Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Agreement. 
						<br><br>
						<b>The Information We Collect</b>
						<br><br>
						At petpetpark.com, where visitors self-identify as 13 years and older we collect a valid e-mail address and birth date, we may collect additional information including Computer Information (see below), gender, state/province, zip/postal code, and country, and we may ask additional questions regarding personal preferences on a number of topics through surveys. For certain enhanced services, we also may collect credit card and billing information (including telephone number). Additionally, when visitors come to our site, we automatically collect some non-personally identifiable "computer" information, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the visitor's "IP Address", the web browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) being used, information collected through the use of cookies (see below) and information regarding the Internet service provider ("Computer Information"). 
						<br><br>
						<b>Electronic Newsletter Subscription</b>
						<br><br>
						PetpetPark.com offers kids the opportunity to sign up to receive the Petpetpark.com newsletter by email. When a kid asks to receive our email newsletter, the child may be asked to provide his or her first name, state of residence and email address and such information is stored in a separate database only used for our email newsletter. At any time, the child may have his or her information removed from our Petpetpark.com newsletter by following the "unsubscribe" instructions found at the end of any of the Petpetpark.com newsletter emails. In addition, parents may at any time review any identifiable information collected about their child (see below). 
						<br><br>
						All information collected for Petpetpark.com newsletters is used only to send the child the electronic newsletter and may be transferred, disclosed, or shared with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle the preparation and delivery of the electronic newsletter and perform other related technical and processing functions. These third parties may not use it for other purposes and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information.
						<b>How We Use the Information </b>
						<br><br>
						We use visitors' Personal Information for our internal purposes of enabling visitors to enter one of our online contests or sweepstakes, to subscribe to our online newsletter, or to inform visitors of upcoming events and special announcements. Each e-mail contains instructions on how to be removed from the subscription list. We also use visitors' Computer Information to track usage, improve the design of the Site, offer products and services, to personalize our visitor's experiences, save your password in password-protected areas, enable you to use shopping carts on our sites and to ensure visitors are following the site's Agreement. Sometimes we will use agents or contractors to help us provide services to our visitors, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes and sending prizes to the winners. In these cases, we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing. Additionally, in the event that all or substantially all of our stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, we may transfer such information and information collected from parents or guardians to the acquiring entity. 
						<br><br>
						You acknowledge, consent, and agree that we may access, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information, Computer Information, or other information and/or content to a law enforcement agency or another third party if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:  (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the Terms of Use; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the owners of the Site, the Site.s users, and the public.
						<br><br>
						<b>Contests and Sweepstakes  </b>
						<br><br>
						etpetpark.com occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes, which may be entered online. To participate in a contest or sweepstakes, a visitor is asked to provide his or her name, state of residence and email address. Sometimes, if the visitor who wishes to enter the contest is under 13, and the contest or sweepstakes may involve more than a one-time contact, we also ask for the email address of the visitor's parent. In those cases, we send the visitor's parent an email within two business days informing him or her of their child's entry and give the parent the option to have the child's entry deleted. All the information collected by petpetpark.com is securely maintained and used only for the purpose of conducting and fulfillment of the contest or sweepstakes. Once the contest or sweepstakes if finished, we delete any personal information collected. The information collected in a petpetpark.com sweepstakes may be passed to a fulfillment house which may use the information to help run the contest or sweepstakes. Any such fulfillment house may not use the information for other purposes and must agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information. 
						<br><br>
						<b>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors </b>
						<br><br>
						Our site contains links to other sites, including those of sponsors, advertisers and survey companies. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices, since our Privacy Policy does not cover those sites. We do not share a visitor's e-mail address or other Personal Information with such third parties without permission; however, if you choose to "opt-in" (click on a box to receive a third party's information), to register with one of our sponsors, or you choose not to "opt-out" (uncheck a checked box that will provide a sponsor with your information), that means you have allowed us to give your registration and other information, including e-mail address, to that third party. 
						<br><br>
						<b>Cookies </b>
						<br><br>
						Petpetpark.com uses a software technology called "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we and certain third parties place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at our site. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. 
						<br><br>
						We may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These "web beacons" may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy. 
						<br><br>
						You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other Web site. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of our sites can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content. 
						<br><br>
						Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third party ad server may collect from you. For more information on third party ad servers, please see <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a> and the section entitled Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors.
						<br><br>
						<b>Security </b>
						<br><br>
						We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. 
						<br><br>
						<b>Phishing</b>
						<br><br>

						Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. "Phishers" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Sensitive Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. <b>WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!</b> If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:Privacy.Petpetpark@Petpetpark.com">Privacy.Petpetpark@Petpetpark.com</a> and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer. 
						<br><br>
						<b>Additional Information Concerning Children's Privacy </b>
						<br><br>

						We do not collect Personal Information from visitors who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except where we receives verifiable parental consent or in those limited circumstances where we believe that such collection is permitted under applicable law. Visitors to our site may participate in many of our offerings and activities without providing any Personal Information. To participate in certain of our interactive features, however, we ask the user to register and provide us with the following information: the visitor's age, as well as e-mail address (not stored for children - click <a href="/help/privacy/parentalconsent">here</a> for more information). We will use e-mail addresses submitted by children to send a one-time account activation code and to respond to specific requests, (e.g., to send a game challenge, allow them to enter a contest, or provide parental notice). We may collect additional information including Computer Information, gender, state/province, zip/postal code, and country, and we may ask additional questions regarding personal preferences on a number of topics through surveys. As noted above, we will not condition participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. We do not share children's Personal Information with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy.
						<br><br>
						At Petpetpark.com, our goal is to help parents ensure that their kids have a safe and fun online experience. That's why we've set up a system by which parents can contact us to review any Personal Information collected about their child, have this information corrected or deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of their child's information. Please make any such request through this e-mail address: <a href="mailto:Privacy.Petpetpark@Petpetpark.com">Privacy.Petpetpark@Petpetpark.com</a>. Petpetpark.com takes steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child and to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian.
