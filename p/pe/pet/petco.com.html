<p>To help protect the privacy of information collected through our Sites, we employ security measures that are intended to be consistent with industry best practices. In addition, we take commercially reasonable steps to store such information with the objective of protecting such data against unauthorized access. Notwithstanding the foregoing, please be aware that our Sites are operated on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, experience breaches of security or other problems beyond our control and that may compromise the security of information collected about you. </p>
<p>Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this privacy policy, no data transmission over the Internet or via a Wi-Fi network, or any encryption method, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. You understand that it may be possible for third parties not under Petco's control to intercept or access your personal information transmitted through one of our Sites or via email. Accordingly, although we undertake commercially reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all information you provide through our Sites, due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that any such information will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others who do not have your authorization. Any such transmission of information about you to Petco is at your own risk.</p>

<p>We may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, compliance with laws, fraud prevention, troubleshooting and enforcement of our terms of use and other agreements.

<h3><a name="children">Children</a></h3>
<p>Our Sites are not designed to appeal to persons under 13 years old ("children"). We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children through our Sites, except for persistent identifiers that may be collected through children's sections of our Sites which (as permitted by applicable law) we will use solely to support the internal operations of the Sites. If we learn that any unauthorized personal information of a child has been collected, we will take appropriate steps to delete such information.

However, Petco is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, regardless whether they are linked or otherwise connected to our Sites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy and terms of use whenever interacting with any third-party website, app, or other offering.</p>

Under California law, a California resident with whom we have an established relationship has the right to request certain information with respect to the types of personal information that we have shared with third parties for these purposes, and the identities of those third parties, within the immediately preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions.
