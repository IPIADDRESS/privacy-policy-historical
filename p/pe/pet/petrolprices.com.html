<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>22nd February 2007<br><br>

PetrolPrices.com is part of a network of sites owned by Fubra Ltd. At Fubra we 
recognise the importance of your privacy. This policy outlines the information 
we collect, how we use it and how we safeguard your information.<br>
<br>

PetrolPrices.com may be required to revise this Privacy Policy in the future to 
comply with any applicable European regulations, in order to utilise new 
technologies or to improve your PetrolPrices.com experience, so please check 
back periodically.<br>
<br>

<h2>When you access PetrolPrices.com</h2>
<ul>
<li>PetrolPrices.com uses <a href="privacy-full.html">cookies</a> to 
store and collect information about your usage of the site in order to enhance 
your online experience and to help us improve the quality of our services.</li>
<li>When you access PetrolPrices.com, your computer automatically sends us 
information such as the URL on our site you have visited, your <a href="privacy-full.html">IP address</a>, your 
browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.</li>
<li>If you perform a search on PetrolPrices.com, your searches are logged and may be used 
internally, so as to better personalise our service to you. </li>
</ul>


<h2>When you Subscribe to PetrolPrices.com</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Your personal details will never be passed onto any other 
companies or third parties including affiliates and will never be added to any 
third party mailing lists or databases.</b></li>
<li>PetrolPrices.com collects <a href="privacy-full.html">personal information</a> when you register on the site. Your information will be stored confidentially by us and only used by PetrolPrices.com and sites owned by Fubra Ltd in order to provide you 
with access to our products, services and information that we believe will 
interest you.</li>
<li>Fubra Limited (trading as PetrolPrices.com) may also use information 
about our users in statistical aggregate form. This is <a href="privacy-full.html">non personal information</a>
but simply refers to information such as number of registrations, traffic patterns and 
site user trends.</li>
<li>If you register for our email alert service, your preferences including location and type of fuel you are interested 
in are logged in order to update you with the most relevant information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you Contact Us</h2> 
<ul>
<li>If you contact us via email, your details and a history 
of the communication will be stored by us in order for us to deal with enquiries 
adequately and improve our customer support services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Preferences and the Fubra Passport</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fubra Limited, the company behind PetrolPrices.com and various other
popular web sites operates a central login system called the Fubra
Passport. This system is a database of the users who can access our web
sites and also contains a set of preferences for each subscriber.
</li>
<li>
When you sign up to a <a href="http://www.fubra.com" target="_blank">Fubra</a> web site a <a href="https://passport.fubra.com/_petrolprices/login.html">Fubra Passport</a> account is opened for you and you can use this to access the content on any of our web sites.
</li>
<li>
As we are usually providing expensive data sets to consumers free of charge, our aim has been to establish a database of subscribers who we communicate with when we add new features to our current web sites or when we launch a new web site that we think our subscribers may be interested in.
</li>
<li>The data we hold in the Fubra Passport system is <b>not available for sale to any third parties</b> and will only ever be used by us with your consent.</li>

<li>If you would prefer <b>not</b> to receive alerts about fuel prices and other data that we email to our subscribers free of charge on a regular basis then you can manage your alerts with us on the <a href="https://secure.petrolprices.com/account-alerts.html">My Alerts</a> page.
</li>
<li>
If you remove all your alerts then we will no longer send you any automatic update emails. However you will still remain a subscriber to our web sites via the Fubra Passport system and will therefore still have access to our web sites when you choose to search for information.
</li>
As a subscriber of the Fubra Passport we will occasionally still email you with news and information about our company, our new web site features and new web sites we develop. If you <b>do not</b> wish to receive any email from us at all, you must then cancel your subscription to our Fubra Passport login system which you can do on this <a href="https://passport.fubra.com/_petrolprices/login.html">page.</a><sup>(requires login)</sup>  

<li>
Please note once you have done this you will no longer be able to log in to any of our web sites without re-subscribing.
</li>
<li>
You can use the <a href="https://passport.fubra.com/_petrolprices/login.html">Fubra Passport</a><sup>(requires login)</sup> page to easily join or leave any of our other web sites that are currently supported by the system. By leaving just one site you will continue to receive emails about other sites if you remain a member of those.
</li>
</ul>
