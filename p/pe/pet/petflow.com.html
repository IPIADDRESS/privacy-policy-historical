<ol>
<li><b>Privacy Policy</b>
<p>The information we collect through our Site helps us provide you with information specific to your needs and interests. Please read below to review our Privacy Policy and the types of information we gather through our Site. In this Privacy Policy, “we”, “us”, “our” and other similar references mean Petflow LLC and “you” and “your” and other similar references mean a specific user of the Site. Your access to and use the Site is subject to the <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.  All capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.  By visiting the Site, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
</li>
<li><b>How Does Petflow Gather and Use Information?</b>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cookies. Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify the browser on your PC. Websites typically use temporary cookies called “session” cookies to ensure that you are recognized when you move from page to page within one site and that any information you have entered is remembered. For example, if an e commerce site did not use session cookies then items placed in a shopping basket would disappear by the time you reach the checkout. Websites also use cookies called “persistent” cookies to enable a website to remember you on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of services or functions offered. Petflow may install both persistent and session cookies when a user arrives at the Site. Cookies enable our systems to gather information about your navigational patterns through the site. Viewers have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through their browsers. Visit the “help” portion of your toolbar for more information. If you block or refuse to accept cookies, or delete cookies between visits to the site, you may not be able to access or use certain features or functions of the Site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server Statistics. We collect general statistics to track user trends on our Site. These statistics include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to access our Site, page views, and navigational patterns. The information that is collected in this manner does NOT provide us with any personally identifiable information about our users. It helps us track “where” our users are coming from. This allows us to pinpoint high traffic areas and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our users. As part of that ongoing analysis, Petflow also uses devices called “web beacons” to help us identify when emails sent to you have been received and read. In order to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers into the Petflow site we may collect information, such as IP addresses, into a log file to be used to identify potential hackers of the Petflow site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal Information You Provide Us. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” is any information that identifies you, would enable someone to contact you, or that describes your relationship with Petflow. Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, credit card information that you provide to us in order to conduct a transaction via the Site.  We collect and store Personal Information when you register to use our Site, ask a question, complete a form, conduct a transaction, or send us an email. While you are not required to submit any information to our Site, if you do not provide the requested information, you may not be able to access or use some of the features and functions of our Site and we may not be able to provide you with certain services. Petflow uses your Personal Information to complete transactions, respond to your requests, deliver the products and services you request, and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you. If you are already receiving Petflow.com emails and no longer wish to receive such communications, simply follow the "unsubscribe" instructions that appear in every Petflow.com e-email, or contact us through the preference center to modify subscriptions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>What Security Procedures Does Petflow Use To Protect Personal Information?</b>
<p>We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.  However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free.  Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information to us or to any other party via the Internet or through e-mail. </p></li>
<li><b>Will Petflow Disclose The Information It Collects To Outside Parties?</b>
<p>We may share your information, including Personal Information, to third parties, as set forth below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions.  Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments.  When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advertisers: We may aggregate Personal Information with Personal Information of other users of the site, and disclose such information in a non-personally, or personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.  In these situations, we may disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legal Requirements: We may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend our rights or property, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.  In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Information may be part of the transferred assets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>External Links.</b>
<p>Other companies or organizations may have links to their web sites on the Site.  We are not responsible for how these other companies or organizations collect, use, disclose, or secure the information that you provide them. If you choose to access a third party web site linked to from the Site, you do so at your own risk and subject to any terms of service or privacy policy (if any) associated with such third party web site. </p></li>
<li><b>Collection Of Information From Children.</b>
<p>We do not direct any of our content specifically to children. Users of the Site are required to be at least 18 years old, and any user under 18 is not an authorized user. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to instruct their children to never provide Personal Information though this Site or any other web site without their permission.  If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through the Site, please contact us and we will endeavor to delete any Personal Information we have collected about that user.</p></li>
<li><b>Consent To Processing In The United States.</b>
<p>By providing any Personal Information to us, all users, including, without limitation, users in Canada and the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of such Personal Information across international borders in accordance with Petflow’s standard operations, including the collection, storage, and processing of such information in the United States of America</p></li>
<li><b>Modification And Notification Of Changes.</b>
<p>We may at our sole discretion edit this Privacy Policy. Notice of all changes to the Privacy Policy will be provided as specified in Section 12 (Modification and Notification of Changes) of the Terms of Service. </p></li>
<li><b>How to Contact Us.</b>
<p>If you have questions or suggestions regarding this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices please send an email message to <a href="mailto:help@petflow.com">help@petflow.com</a>.</p>
