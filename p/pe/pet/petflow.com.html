				Privacy Policy.
				<p class="privacy-txt">
				The information we collect through our Site helps us provide you with information specific to your needs and interests. Please read below to review our Privacy Policy and the types of information we gather through our Site. In this Privacy Policy, “we”, “us”, “our” and other similar references mean Petflow LLC and “you” and “your” and other similar references mean a specific user of the Site. Your access to and use the Site is subject to the <a href="/terms-of-service" target="_self">Terms of Service</a>. All capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the <a href="/terms-of-service" target="_self">Terms of Service</a>.

				How Does Petflow Gather and Use Information?
				<ol type="i">
					<li>
						<p class="privacy-txt">Cookies. Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify the browser on your PC. Websites typically use temporary cookies called “session” cookies to ensure that you are recognized when you move from page to page within one site and that any information you have entered is remembered. For example, if an e commerce site did not use session cookies then items placed in a shopping basket would disappear by the time you reach the checkout. Websites also use cookies called “persistent” cookies to enable a website to remember you on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of services or functions offered. Petflow may install both persistent and session cookies when a user arrives at the Site. Cookies enable our systems to gather information about your navigational patterns through the site. Viewers have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through their browsers. Visit the “help” portion of your toolbar for more information. If you block or refuse to accept cookies, or delete cookies between visits to the site, you may not be able to access or use certain features or functions of the Site.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="privacy-txt">Server Statistics. We collect general statistics to track user trends on our Site. These statistics include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to access our Site, page views, and navigational patterns. The information that is collected in this manner does NOT provide us with any personally identifiable information about our users. It helps us track “where” our users are coming from. This allows us to pinpoint high traffic areas and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our users. As part of that ongoing analysis, Petflow also uses devices called “web beacons” to help us identify when emails sent to you have been received and read. In order to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers into the Petflow site we may collect information, such as IP addresses, into a log file to be used to identify potential hackers of the Petflow site.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="privacy-txt">Personal Information You Provide Us. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” is any information that identifies you, would enable someone to contact you, or that describes your relationship with Petflow. Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, credit card information that you provide to us in order to conduct a transaction via the Site. We collect and store Personal Information when you register to use our Site, ask a question, complete a form, conduct a transaction, or send us an email. While you are not required to submit any information to our Site, if you do not provide the requested information, you may not be able to access or use some of the features and functions of our Site and we may not be able to provide you with certain services. Petflow uses your Personal Information to complete transactions, respond to your requests, deliver the products and services you request, and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you. If you are already receiving Petflow.com emails and no longer wish to receive such communications, simply follow the "unsubscribe" instructions that appear in every Petflow.com e-email, or contact us through the preference center to modify subscriptions.</p>

				What Security Procedures Does Petflow Use To Protect Personal Information?

						<p class="privacy-txt">Advertisers: We may aggregate Personal Information with Personal Information of other users of the site, and disclose such information in a non-personally, or personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.

We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to instruct their children to never provide Personal Information though this Site or any other web site without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through the Site, please contact us and we will endeavor to delete any Personal Information we have collected about that user.</p>

				Consent To Processing In The United States.
				<p class="privacy-txt">By providing any Personal Information to us, all users, including, without limitation, users in Canada and the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of such Personal Information across international borders in accordance with Petflow’s standard operations, including the collection, storage, and processing of such information in the United States of America.</p>
