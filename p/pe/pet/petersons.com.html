<span class="Heading_2">2. Children's Privacy</span>
</p>
<p>
Our Services are not structured to attract children under 13, and we do not intend to collect personally identifiable information
from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, please do not use our Services. If we find out we
have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information about a child under 13, we will take all reasonable measures
to delete that information from our system as soon as possible.</p>
<span class="Heading_2">3. Information We Collect</span>
<p>We collect information so we can identify you as our customer, to establish, manage, and protect your account, to complete
your transactions, to create and offer you products and services you may be interested in, and to comply with various legal
and regulatory requirements.</p>
<strong style="margin: 10px 0px; display: block;">Non-Identifying Information</strong>
<p>We may collect Non-Identifying Information information from your use of our Services, as part of the registration and administration
of your account, or to personalize and improve upon your experience. Non-Identifying Information is anonymous and includes
information such as IP addresses, web pages which have been viewed, search queries that have been submitted, education
interests, date and time, domain type, and responses by a visitor to an advertisement, and content delivered by us or a
third party advertising or technology vendor. We and our business partners may use different types of technologies to collect
this type of information, including cookies and web beacons (1x1 pixels).</p>
<p>Additionally, when registering for the site or requesting education information from one of our business partners on our
Services, we may collect additional non-identifying information about the individual. Examples of the non-personally identifiable
data that may be requested include gender, ethnicity, military status, education background, geographic location and other
information. None of this information (collectively referred to as "non-identifying information"), by itself, or together
with other non-identifying information, can by its nature be matched with a specific individual. We have no access or control
of third party tracking technologies.</p>
<p>During the course of the visitor's use of our Services, we automatically collect certain information through cookies, web
beacons, log files, and other common data collection techniques, and we receive information from third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Website Cookies:</strong> The Services may place "cookies" on a visitor's device. Cookies are small text files.
Our Cookies save anonymized data about individual visitors, allowing our Services to recognize information about a visitor
and help deliver personalized content and other services and functions. Cookies make your Internet experience quicker and
more convenient. The Services use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his or her browser, and persistent
cookies, which remain on the user's device until they expire or are manually deleted. The Services also contain coding
from our business and technology partners which generates third party cookies. Third party cookies allow our business and
technology partners to store non-Identifying Information they can access when you visit this or other websites. Accepting
a cookie from a web or device browser does not give us access to any Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>Most website and mobile device browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and provide
the ability to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block
cookies with your browser. Blocking cookies may result in a lower quality experience for you while you are using our Services.</p>
<p><strong>Device and Connection Information:</strong> When you use our Services, we will identify the Internet Protocol (IP)
address of your computer or handled device. The IP address doesnât identify you personally, but it lets us identify the
device you are using. We store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security purposes. We may also collect
other device-specific information about the device you are using, including what type of device it is and hardware model,
what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifies, geo-location data, and crash data. Whether
we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. Check the
policies of your device manufacturer or software provider to learn more about what information your device makes available
to us.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons (1x1 Pixels or GIFS):</strong> Our Services contain coding known as Web Beacons that use 1x1 pixel images
to capture and transmit the online activity of users on our Services. These Web Beacons typically transmit information
about form completions and other activities in order to measure advertising effectiveness or store analytics information.
In addition, we may use Web Beacons in HTML-based emails. This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of our email communications
and our marketing campaigns by showing how many emails recipients have opened.</p>
<p><strong>Log Files:</strong> Our servers also utilize log files. Log files store information including internet protocol
(IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and
number of clicks. Log files are used to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users' movement in the aggregate,
and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use log file information at times to help identify you as
you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our Services.</p>
<strong style="margin: 10px 0px; display: block;">Google Analytics Advertising Features</strong>
<p>We use Google Analytics to collect information about the use of the Services. Google Analytics collects information such
as how often users visit the Services, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming
to our Services. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Services. Google Analytics collects
only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Services, rather than your name or other identifying information.
We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with Personally Identifiable Information.
Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time
you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Googleâs ability to use and share information collected
by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a> and the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this Website by <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">disabling the Google Analytics</a> cookie on your browser. You can also view and change the <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en" target="_blank">currently available opt-outs</a> for Google Ads.</p>
<p>We also use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors
of our Services. This could be in the form of an advertisement on other websites or on the Google search results page.
Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someoneâs past visits to the Website. Any data
collection will be used in accordance with our own Privacy Policy and Googleâs privacy policy. You can set preferences
for how Google advertises to you using <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en" target="_blank">Googleâs Ads Settings</a>.
Alternatively, you can opt-out of a third party vendorâs use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track Signals:</strong> Do Not Track is a feature in your web or device browser, which enables you to opt-out
of the third party tracking of your online activities over time and across third party websites. We do not process or comply
with any web or device browserâs âdo not trackâ signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online
tracking of individual users who use our Services.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Information:</strong> We may receive information about you from other sources. For example, we may receive
updated or corrected contact information from third party vendors as part of vendors' fraud detection services. We may
also receive information about you from third-party accounts. On some of our Services, you can log in to our site using
sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide
you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign
up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Services to
your profile page to share with others within your network. All information received from these third party sources is
utilized in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<span class="Heading_2">4. Personally Identifiable Information</span>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information, as used in this Privacy Policy, means any information or set of information that can
be used to trace or identify a specific individual, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information
that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. Examples of personally identifiable data that may be requested include
name, address and email address, and phone numbers (home, mobile, office, and/or fax numbers). We generally collect this
information on our Services to match you with educational opportunities, personalize content and to allow the user to request
contact from educational institutions. We may share or sell your personal information with or to third parties, but if
we do so, it will be as described in this Privacy Policy. Providing your personal information is always voluntary, and
you can always choose not to provide your personal information by choosing not to use our Services. By providing your personal
information, you acknowledge and consent to our use of such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you
would like to opt-out of having your personally identifiable information disclosed or distributed with or to third-parties,
contact us at privacy@petersons.com.</p>
<p>We also collect information that you provide to us when you register for an account on our Services, including username
and passwords, request information about a particular school or educational program, or otherwise voluntarily provide information
about yourself and/or your educational interests. Most commonly, our Services provide users the opportunity to request
information from schools  and other third-party organizations&nbsp;and to learn about various opportunities. These information request pages require users
to provide us with contact information (name, address, phone numbers [home, work and mobile], email address, age, work
experience, military history, etc.) as well as information about their interest in one or more of our education or business
partners (universities, colleges, test preparation companies, financial aid providers, athletic recruiting organizations,&nbsp;etc.). We collect this information
that you provide and may use it to make your future requests from our Services easier by pre-populating contact forms with
the information that you have provided. We may sell or share this contact information that you provide to&nbsp;the organization you requested information from and that information usage is covered by their privacy policy.</p>
<strong style="margin: 10px 0px; display: block;">Testimonials</strong>
<p>From time to time, we post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our Services which may contain personally identifiable
information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with
their testimonial.</p>
<strong style="margin: 10px 0px; display: block;">Public Forums</strong>
<p>Our Services offer publicly accessible blogs. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be
read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community
forum, contact us at privacy@petersons.com or the mailing address provided at the end of this document. In some cases,
we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and
why.
</p>
<p><strong>Social Plug-Ins:</strong> In addition, we do utilize social plug-ins from social networking sites (e.g. YouTube,
Google+) that connect our Services with the social plug-ins' platform, so you have a more integrated user experience. These
social plug-ins collect information from you when you visit our Services. The type of information and use of this information
is governed by each social-plugins' respective terms of use and privacy policy. For more information, please consult the
relevant policy for the respective social networking site. Further, we may share Non-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying
Information with such integrated social media sites.</p>
<span class="Heading_2">5. How We Use and Share Information</span>
<p>In addition to the uses listed in other sections of this Privacy Policy, the information you provide to us and the automatically-collected
information (both Personally Identifying and Non-Identifying Information) is used and shared to provide a number of different
functions and services on our Services and in coordination with our technology and business partners. This utilization
includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We may provide you targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or postal mail.</li>
    <li>We may contact you for feedback on Service features and functionality, and improving the content and layout of our Services

    <li>We may use the account information to manage your account, facilitate the use of certain features of our Services (e.g.,

    interest lists) and to send you information about our company, services and products or offers from our business partners.

    you visit our Services, and to display certain usage information that may be helpful for you, such as your recent searches

We will not rent, share, disclose, or sell your information if you have opted out of having your personally identifiable information disclosed or distributed with or to third-parties.</li>
    <li>In addition to the uses described above, we may use your personal information for any of the following:

        <li>We aggregate personal information into statistics about users, their usage of the Services, traffic patterns, and demographics.

        control over the use of your information once provided to third party education institutions and service providers,
        and your rights in respect of their treatment of your information will be governed by their own policies.</li>
        <li>We may occasionally use external service providers to facilitate, improve, or outsource elements of our service or operation
        of the Services, including processing transactions, sending emails, and providing marketing assistance or analysis.
        We may provide your information to, or exchange your information with, these service providers for use in their provision
        of services to us, such as fraud protection, compliance monitoring, or marketing analysis. These external service providers
        may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions or services to us, but may not use it for
        other purposes including their own marketing.</li>
        <li>We may share your information with companies that are affiliated with us, such as our direct or indirect subsidiaries
        or parent or sister companies, as well as other non-affiliated third parties. As we continue to develop our business, we might buy or sell companies, subsidiaries,
        or business units. In such transactions, user information is generally one of the transferred assets but remains subject
        to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy. In the event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are
        acquired, your information may be one of the transferred assets and we may share it with an actual or potential acquirer.</li>
        <li>We may release information from or about you to cooperate with law enforcement officials and third parties to enforce
        all applicable laws, including but not limited to, laws relating to intellectual property rights, fraud, and other rights.
        We also may release information from or about you without a subpoena, court order, or other substantially similar legal
        procedure to law enforcement entities or third parties when we believe release is necessary to comply with the law;
        to protect our rights, property, or the integrity of the Services, or the rights or property of our merchants/service
        providers, customers, users, or third parties; or to prevent or investigate illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
        involving potential threat to the physical safety of any person, or violation of our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> or other agreement
        between you and us. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose information from or about you to consumers who
        have alleged fraud or any other consumer dispute relating to their transactions and/or communications with you.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<span class="Heading_2">6. Control of Third Party Data Usage</span>
<p>While the Company undertakes efforts to see that any third party with whom we share personal or other information is under
contractual obligation to use it solely for the purposes for which the information was disclosed and in accordance with
the terms of this Privacy Policy, such parties are independent third parties over which we exercise no direct control.
We are not responsible for, and will not be liable for, their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination
practices.
</p>
<span class="Heading_2">7. Accessing and Changing Your Personal Information</span>
<p>We provide a number of different opportunities to review and change information in your profile or that we have stored about
you. For example, you can log into your account to make desired changes.</p>

we have shared your information with our business partners, including educational institutions, we no longer have control
over the removal of such information, and we will not be able to remove your information from their systems.</p>
<p>Please be advised that by requesting that your data be removed from our database, or deactivating your account, you will
be removed from our Services. Also note that the information removal request does not carry forward, and any subsequent
return to the Services will result in additional information capture and sharing in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any request from you, we may retain a record of your information that is necessary to comply with applicable
law or as necessary to manage your account.</p>
<span class="Heading_2">8. Links to Third Party Websites</span>
<p>The Services, as well as the electronic messages sent by us, may contain links to other sites or services. We are not responsible
for the privacy practices or the content of such third party sites. If you have a question about the privacy policy of
those other sites, please contact them directly.</p>

<span class="Heading_2">11. Your California Privacy Rights</span>
<p>California has passed legislation requiring certain disclosures be made available to California residents who use the Internet and provide information that may be used for marketing purposes.
