<br>
<span class="Heading_2">1. Privacy Policy Overview</span><br>
<br>
Peterson’s Nelnet, LLC (the "Company") operates the Website petersons.com (the "Website") and versions of the site, including co-branded and/or framed versions of the site with third parties, that refer to this Website Privacy Statement in a link. This Website Privacy Policy is designed to inform you of the types of information we collect from users, how we use that information, and the circumstances under which we will share it with third parties.<br>
<br>
This Website Privacy Policy applies only to this Website. It does not apply to your use of any other websites (whether or not operated by us), including any websites to which we provide links or websites of our business partners, or to any activities which are not online. This Privacy Policy pertains to information collected only directly through the Website and does not apply to personal information collected from offline resources and communications (for instance, if you send the Company a postal letter or call the Company).<br>
<br>
Please note that in some instances we utilize framing techniques, which make it appear that you are on our Website when you are actually on a third-party Web site. The privacy policy that governs the collection and use of the information will be present on these pages so you always know whose privacy practices govern the collection and use of the information that you submit.<br>
<br>
Please note that some features and/or functions referenced may not be included on this Website and the portions of this Website Privacy Policy that pertain to those features or functions may not be applicable.<br>
<br>
This Website Privacy Policy is effective as of the date listed above and applies to all Websites that link to this policy. Even if you read and/or agreed to a prior privacy statement, you need to review this updated version. We reserve the right to revise this Policy at any time and at our discretion. If we decide to make a material change to our Website Privacy Policy, we will post those changes and make them accessible on the homepage of the Website, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.<br>
<br>
<span class="Heading_2">2. Children's Privacy</span><br>
<br>
The Website is not structured to attract children under 13, and the Company does not intend to collect personally identifiable information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, please do not use our Website. If we find out we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information about a child under 13, we will take all reasonable measures to delete that information from our system as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
<span class="Heading_2">3. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</span><br>
<br>
The Company and/or our third-party advertising or technology vendors may collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information using various tracking technologies described in this privacy policy. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is anonymous and includes information such as IP address, web pages which have been viewed, search queries that have been submitted, education interests, date and time, domain type, and responses by a visitor to an advertisement and content delivered by us or a third party advertising or technology vendor. The Company and our business partners may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and web beacons (1x1 pixels). Additionally, when registering for the site or requesting education information from one of our business partners on the Website, we may collect additional non-personally identifiable information about the individual. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be requested include gender, ethnicity, military status, education background, geographic location and other information. None of this information (collectively referred to as "non-personally identifiable information"), by itself, or together with other non-personally identifiable information, can by its nature be matched with a specific individual. We have no access or control of third party tracking technologies.<br>
<br>
<span class="Heading_2">4. Personally Identifiable Information</span><br>
<br>
Personally Identifiable Information, as used in this Website Privacy Policy, means any information or set of information that can be used to trace or identify a specific individual, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.  Examples of personally identifiable data that may be requested include name, address and email address, and phone numbers (home, mobile, office, and/or fax numbers). The Company generally collects this information on the Website to match you with educational opportunities, personalize content and to allow the user to request contact from educational institutions.  We may share or sell your personal information with or to third parties, but if we do so, it will be as described in this privacy policy.  Providing your personal information is always voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide your personal information by choosing not to use our Website. By providing your personal information, you acknowledge and consent to our use of such information in accordance with this Website Privacy Policy.  If you would like to opt-out of having your personally identifiable information disclosed or distributed with or to third-parties, please click <a href="http://petersons.com/opt-out-privacy.aspx">here</a>.<br>
<br>
<span class="Heading_2">5. Automatically Collected Information</span><br>
<br>
During the course of the visitor's use of the Website, we automatically collect certain information on the Website through cookies, web beacons, log files, and other common Website data collection techniques and we receive information from third parties.<br>
<br>
<strong>Website Cookies:</strong> The Website may place "cookies" on a visitor's computer. Cookies are small text files. Our Cookies save anonymized data about individual visitors, allowing the Website to recognize information about a visitor and help deliver personalized content and other services and functions. <br>
<br>
The Website uses both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until they expire or are manually deleted.<br>
<br>
The Website also contains coding from our business and technology partners which generates third-party cookies. Third-party cookies allow our business and technology partners to store non-Personally Identifiable Information they can access when you visit this or other Websites.<br>
<br>
Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and provide the ability to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. Blocking cookies may result in a lower quality experience for you while you are the Website.<br>
<br>
<strong>Web Beacons (1x1 Pixels or GIFS):</strong> Our Website contains coding known as Web Beacons that use 1x1 pixel images to capture and transmit the online activity of users on our Website. These Web Beacons typically transmit information about form completions and other Website activities in order to measure advertising effectiveness or store analytics information. In addition, the Company may use Web Beacons in HTML-based emails. This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of our email communications and our marketing campaigns by showing how many emails recipients have opened. <br>
<br>
<strong>Log Files:</strong> Like most Websites, our servers utilize log files. Log files store information including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. Log files are used to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use log file information at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our Website.<br>
<br>
<strong>Third-Party Information:</strong> We may receive information about you from other sources. For example, we may receive updated or corrected contact information from third party vendors as part of vendors' fraud detection services. We may also receive information about you from third-party accounts. On some of our sites, you can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.

        <li>We aggregate personal information into statistics about users, their usage of the Website, traffic patterns, and demographics. We may provide third parties with such statistics, but not in a way that would make that information personally identifiable. </li>
        <li>We allow sharing of information with third parties through your use of "Share", "Like" or other social interaction widgets on our Website.

        <li>If you choose to submit to us your contact information as part of a request to be contacted by education institutions or service providers, the Company will supply to those third-parties your information, and those institutions or providers may contact you using your information regarding the specific query that you have provided. Upon receiving your request, the Company or third-party may contact you regarding requested or related products and/or services via phone, fax, email, postal mail or text message regardless of your status on opt-out lists such as Do Not Call registries or previously unsubscribing from their messages or opting out of this Website.

As we continue to develop our business we might buy or sell companies, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, user information is generally one of the transferred assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Website Privacy Policy. In the event that we or substantially all of our assets are acquired, your information may be one of the transferred assets and we may share it with an actual or potential acquirer. </li>
        <li>We may release information from or about you to cooperate with law enforcement officials and third parties to enforce all applicable laws, including but not limited to, laws relating to intellectual property rights, fraud, and other rights. We also may release information from or about you without a subpoena, court order or other substantially similar legal procedure to law enforcement entities or third parties when we believe release is necessary to comply with the law; to protect our rights, property, or the integrity of the Website, or the rights or property of our merchants/service providers, customers, users or third parties; or to prevent or investigate illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threat to the physical safety of any person, or violation of our Terms of Use or other agreement between you and us. Further we can (and you authorize us to) disclose information from or about you to consumers who have alleged fraud or any other consumer dispute relating to their transactions and/or communications with you. </li>

<br>
While the Company undertakes efforts to see that any third party with whom the Company shares personal or other information is under contractual obligation to use it solely for the purposes for which the information was disclosed and in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, such parties are independent third parties over which the Company exercises no direct control. The Company is not responsible for, and will not be liable for, their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices.<br>

<span class="Heading_2">10. Links to Third Party Websites</span><br>
<br>
The Website, as well as the electronic messages sent as part of the Company's services, may contain links to other sites or services.
