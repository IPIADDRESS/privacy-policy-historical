            <p>This privacy policy applies in respect  of the websites controlled by Pethealth Inc. and/or its subsidiary and other  affiliated entities ("Pethealth," "we" or "us")  where this privacy policy is posted under the authority of Pethealth  (collectively, the "Sites"), as well as, unless otherwise indicated,  in respect of any other personal information collected by Pethealth. <strong>BY USING  THE SITES, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND  TO OUR PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES STATED BELOW. IF YOU  DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT  USE THE SITES.</strong></p>
            <br>
            
          	<h3 class="blue">A. Information Collected</h3>
            
            <p>We collect two types of information from  users of the Sites: <strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information;</strong> and <strong>(2)  Non-Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address or  cookies-related information.</strong><br>
            <br>
            For the purposes of this Policy, users  of the Sites include Guests and Members. Guests to the Sites are able to browse  the Sites, search profiles, and view various content on the Sites, such as  articles or polls, without entering any personal information. In respect of  Guests, only certain non-personally identifiable information is collected. In  respect of Members, certain personally identifiable information is collected  when Members create a Member account, enter into a sweepstakes/contest,  purchase a product from The Petango Store and certain other occasions as may  arise in connection with their use of the Sites. In addition, as in the case of  a Guest, non-personally identifiable information is captured automatically and  may or may not be linked to the personally identifiable information of the  Member in question.</p>
            <br>
            
            <h3 class="dark">(1) Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Personally identifiable information may  include, but is not necessarily limited to, a Member's:</strong></p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                    <li>Name</li>
                    <li>Location</li>

                    <li>Billing Address</li>
                </ol>
			<p>Members of the Site may also provide, in  exchange for greater access to features and functionality and/or to receive the  full experience of Membership, certain otherwise non-personally identifiable  information such as income, age, gender, pictures and opinions that may be  linked to personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to  us. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>If you do not  want Pethealth to collect your personally identifiable information, please do  not provide it to us. To learn how to limit our use of the information you  provide to us, see below at Section F.</strong><br></p>
            <br>
            
            <h3 class="dark">(2) Non-Personally Identifiable  Information</h3>
            
            <p>"Non-Personally Identifiable  Information" can be technical information, such as your browser type, IP  address, screen resolution, Internet connection speed, operating system, the  date and time of you access our Sites, the web pages you visit and the Internet  address of the web site from which you linked to our site. It could also be  demographic information, such as your age, gender or interests. Non-personally  identifiable information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some  examples of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via  the Sites and a description of how this information may be used: </p>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Internet Protocol (IP) address -- Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our Sites to the interests of our users and to measure traffic within our Sites. </li>
                <li>Your Activity on the Sites – <em>Cookies:</em> A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Sites. For example, when someone visits a page within the Sites, a cookie is placed on the user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Sites previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features       enjoyed by other users to our Sites. <em>Web Beacons</em> <em>(also known as "clear gifs," "web bugs" or "pixel tags"):</em> "Web Beacons" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages. </li>
                <li>Demographic Information -- "Demographic Information" includes your gender, age, zip code and interests, which you voluntarily provide to us on the Sites. We use this information to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure the information provided by the Sites meets your needs.</li>
                <li>Aggregated Information -- Please note that we also consider aggregated information that does not correspond to any one person to be non-personally identifiable information.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <h3 class="blue">B. Use of Information Collected Via the  Sites</h3>
            
            <p><strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information.</strong></p>
            <p>We use your personally identifiable  information for the following purposes:</p>
            
            	<ul type="disc">
                    <li>To deliver services, such as educational programs, information, newsletters, pet insurance or pet related products, you request or purchase; </li>
                    <li>To alert you to special offers, updated information and other new services from Pethealth, or other third parties, or to forward promotional materials; </li>
                    <li>To complete a transaction or service requested by you; </li>
                    <li>To fulfill the terms of a promotion; </li>
                    <li>To assist in ensuring the Sites are relevant to your needs; </li>
                    <li>To help us create and publish content most relevant to you; </li>
                    <li>To notify you about a material change to this privacy policy or the Visitor Agreement, if necessary; </li>
                    <li>To allow you access to limited-entry areas of the Sites; and </li>
                    <li>To contact you in response to sign up forms such as Contact Us or Order Inquiry. </li>
                </ul>
                
			<p>We do not use your personally  identifiable information for purposes other than those to which you consent and  your personally identifiable information is deleted when consent is withdrawn  or when the purposes in question have been met.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable  Information.</strong><br>
            <br>
            We use non-personally identifiable  information collected on the Sites in the manner disclosed above at Section A (2).<br>
            <br>
            
            </p><h3 class="blue">C. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h3>
            <br>
            <strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
            <br>
            We may share or disclose your personally  identifiable information in the instances set out below, subject to the  "Opt-Out" options described further below at Section F: <br>
            <br>
            (i) To unaffiliated third-party service  providers, agents or independent contractors for the purposes of fulfilling a  service to you. For example, if you submit or monitor a claim or wish to utilize  social networking functionality in connection with one of the Sites, we may  disclose your personally identifiable information to certain trusted  third-party service providers and/or agents to assist in the fulfillment of the  service(s) in question. As well, if you choose to watch an educational program  on the Sites, we may share your personally identifiable information with  third-parties as required in order to provide the program to you. In addition,  if you email us a question, we may use your email address to process your  request and respond to your question. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes  or contest, we may use your personally identifiable information in order to  fulfill the terms of that promotion. This means that we may share the information  for prize fulfillment purposes or mail carriers. We also may share your  information with the co-sponsor of that promotion. In the case of such  sweepstakes/contests/promotions, we will share your information only in  accordance with the consent you provide us for such purposes.<br>
            <br>
            (ii) To unaffiliated third-party service  providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our Sites and  provide other administrative services to us (including, but not limited to,  order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and  analyzing data, sending customer communications on Pethealth's behalf, and  entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests,  sweepstakes and other promotions). We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated  third parties will not use the personally identifiable information for any  other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are  responsible. Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help  us administer our Sites will have access to users' personally identifiable  information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service  providers to have access to your information, please do not register or submit  any personally identifiable information to us. <br>
            <br>
            (iii) To complete your purchase. If you  choose to make a purchase on the Sites, we may collect from you your credit  card number, billing address and other information related to such purchase,  and we may use such collected information in order to fulfill your purchase. We  may also provide such information, or other personally identifiable information  provided by you, to unaffiliated third parties as necessary to complete your  purchase (for example, to process your credit card). <br>
            <br>
            (iv) To comply with the law or in the  good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the  requirements of law or comply with legal process served on us, protect and  defend our rights or property, including the rights and property of Pethealth  and its family of Sites or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal  safety of our end users. <br>
            <br>
            (v) To third parties as part of any  corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers,  acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets. <br>
            <br>
            (vi) To track and analyze usage and  volume statistical information and provide such information to third parties. <br>
            <br>
            (vii) To protect against potential  fraud, we may verify with third parties the information collected from these  Sites. In the course of such verification, we may receive personally  identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you  use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card  authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information  and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card  has not been reported as lost or stolen. <br>
            <br>
            Except as described in this Privacy  Policy or at the time we request the information, we do not share or otherwise  disclose your personally identifiable information to any third parties. <p></p>
            <p><strong>(2)  Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong> <br>
            <br>
            We may share this non-personal  information with third parties.</p>
            <br>
            
            <h3 class="blue">D. Age Screening and the Collection and Use of Information from Children</h3>

            <h3 class="blue">E. International Transfer of Information</h3>
            
            <p>If you choose to provide us with  personally identifiable information, Pethealth may transfer that information to  its affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, across borders, and  from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around  the world. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with  laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please  note that you are transferring your personally identifiable information to the  United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and  by providing your personally identifiable information you consent to: </p>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>the use of your personally identifiable information for the uses identified       above in accordance with this privacy policy; and </li>
                <li>the transfer of your personally identifiable information to the United States       as indicated above. </li>

            <p>We communicate with users who subscribe  to our services on a regular basis via email. For example, we may use your  email address to confirm your request, to send you notice of payments, to send you  information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and  other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt-out of these  communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than  promotional. <br>
            <br>
            However, we provide you the opportunity  to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types of  communication from us, such as emails or updates from us regarding new services and products offered on this Site or if you do not want us to share your  personally identifiable information with third parties. The opt-out choice may  be exercised by ticking or un-ticking the appropriate box if such checkbox is  available at the points where personally identifiable information is collected  or by contacting us (see below at Section N). We will process your unsubscribe request as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some circumstances you  may receive a few more messages until the unsubscribe is processed. You also  may opt-out of receiving such emails by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link within the text of the email.</p>
