By using the Site and the Services, you consent to the following terms.</p><p>YOUR VISITATION, USE, AND REGISTRATION ON THIS SITE MEANS THAT YOU ACCEPT THE PRACTICES SET FORTH IN THIS POLICY.&nbsp; WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE POLICY AT ANY TIME.&nbsp; YOUR CONTINUED USE INDICATES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE CHANGES.&nbsp; IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK BACK REGULARLY FOR UPDATES TO THIS POLICY.</p><p>This policy covers the following topics:</p><ol><li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the Site or the Services;</li><li>How the information is used;</li><li>With whom the information may be shared;</li><li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information; and</li><li>How you can <b>OPT OUT</b> of receiving marketing information from or providing personal information to Provider.</li><li>How you correct errors or inaccuracies in your information.</li></ol><p><strong>1. What information do we collect?</strong><br> We collect several different types of information from you:</p><p><strong>A. Information collected at registration</strong><br> We collect personal information when you register with us and when you use our Services. We may combine this information about you with information we obtain from our business partners or other companies. During registration for some of our services, we may require users to give us basic contact information (such as your first and last name, e-mail addresses, and mobile phone number). The information requested on the registration form may change from time to time. Although additional demographic information may be requested at the time of registration, only information marked “required” is necessary for registration and utilization of our services.</p><p>We do not accept registrations from persons under the age of eighteen. If you are between the ages of 16-18 you must have your parent’s approval to register. If we learn that a user is under the age of eighteen without valid parental approval, we will terminate the account and delete the user’s information. We will not be liable for any content or advertisements viewed by minor children in violation of the terms of this policy.</p><p>In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the Site is not directed at or designed to attract children.&nbsp; Accordingly, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age.</p><p><strong>B. Information collected through use of the Site and Services</strong><br> In addition to the specific questions you answer when you register for our Services, we may also collect information from winners of our contests, such as their street address, phone number, and date of birth so that we can comply with various state and federal reporting requirements.</p><p>We collect system information such as IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting, security, and to examine overall traffic trends. This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for administrative purposes.</p><p>We also may use cookies, a small data file stored on your computer, to customize portions of our Services and Site to your preferences. For example, we may use this cookie to identify you as a registered user of our Services. If you do not allow your browser to accept cookies, please understand that some of the areas or functionality within our Site may be limited.</p><p>If you opt in to this <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, Provider may share, sell, or license cookies collected from you browser and hard drive to third-party advertisers. These authorized third parties may link your name, address, and e-mail address to other information which they collect, such as past online/offline purchase information and Web usage from other sites.

These Social Media Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Social Media Features to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Social Media Features are governed by the <strong>privacy policy</strong> of the company providing such features.<br> <strong>2. What do we do with the information we collect?</strong><br> Without limiting the foregoing, by providing your personal information on the Site, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the “Rule”) and applicable state do-not-call regulations.&nbsp; As such, notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing, including by means of a pre-recorded message and automated voice dialing, in accordance with the Rule and the applicable state do-not-call regulations.</p><p>Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Site constitutes your express written consent to receive telemarketing calls from third-party marketers, including by means of a pre-recorded message and automated voice dialing.

We encourage you to investigate the privacy policies and practices of any third parties prior to disclosing personal information to them.</p><p><strong>8. Security</strong><br> Your privacy is important to us and we take commercially reasonable measures to protect the security of the personal information we collect. Because this site does not encrypt incoming e-mail, you should not send information that you consider highly sensitive through this Web site. We use commercially reasonable security measures to ensure that your personally identifiable information is not lost, misused, altered, or unintentionally destroyed. We also use software programs that monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><p>When you enter sensitive information on our site, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p><p><strong>9.
