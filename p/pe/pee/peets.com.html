<p>We receive or collect some information automatically when you visit our site or engage with other online content we provide. For example, we receive the IP address of the computer or other device you use to access our sites, which may reveal your general geographic location. We collect or receive other information using technology features such as:</p>
<p><em>Cookies.</em> A cookie is a file saved to your computer or device that may be used to recognize our users when they return to our website, collect usage information, remember user's preferences, and provide customized versions of our site. We use this information to evaluate our web traffic, improve our website and services, enhance our communications, and understand the effectiveness of our ad or promotional campaigns. For more information on your choices regarding cookies, see the Your Choices section below.</p>
<p><em>Web Beacons.</em> Our site uses web beacons or pixels that monitor some types of use.

We use this information to understand patterns of activity on our site, to improve its features, and to customize our presentation of content to our users, including online advertising.</p>
<p><em>Online Advertising.</em> We provide online advertisements about our products and services on other parties' websites. We may engage third party ad networks and analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate how users interact with and respond to our ads.

For more information on your choices regarding cookies, see the Your Choices section below.</p>
<p><em>Referrer Headers.</em> We may record referrer headers when you follow links to our website, which may be sent to us automatically by your web browser.

We use this information to understand our web traffic, to improve our services, to increase their accessibility to search engines and others, and to monitor our advertising campaigns.</p>
<p class="strong">How We Share Your Information</p>
<p>We may share personal information with trusted parties, such as service providers who assist us in our business and who are only permitted to use your information in ways we have authorized or to comply with legal requirements. These trusted parties include:</p>
<ul class="disc" style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
<li>Our subsidiaries and affiliates;</li>
<li>Trusted business partners, such as companies we partner with for joint projects;</li>
<li>When reasonably requested or required by law enforcement authorities or other government officials;</li>
<li>When required by law or in response to legal process;</li>
<li>When we believe disclosure is appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss;</li>
<li>When reasonably necessary to an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; and</li>
<li>In the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="strong">Your Choices</p>
<p>We offer you certain choices about the information we collect, how we use and share information, and how we communicate with you. To help protect your privacy, when you exercise these choices we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password.</p>

<ul class="disc" style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
<li>Marketing communications. You may opt out of specific communications (such as marketing emails) by following the opt out instructions contained in the communication.</li>
<li>Cookies. Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. However, rejecting cookies may affect your user experience, and you may not be able to access or use certain features of our sites. In addition, disabling cookies may invalidate opt outs that rely on cookies, such as web analytics or targeted advertising opt outs.</li>
<li>Targeted advertising. If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information. These network advertising programs may allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities.

<li>Geographic location. When you use our website on your mobile device, you may choose not to share your location with us by adjusting the deviceâs location services settings. For instructions on changing the relevant settings, please contact your plan provider or device manufacturer.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we will take all reasonable steps to honor your choices with respect to your personal information, you should be aware that it is not always possible to delete all of your information for technical reasons. For example, we may store personal information in long-term archives or backups or retain an identifier to honor your opt out choices. We will continue to send you service-related communications, and we may need to keep the information we have collected about you for record keeping, analysis, or other reasons, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
