PeekYou acknowledges the concerns that you may have about the use of information about you. Out of respect for those concerns, we maintain strict policies to ensure the privacy and security of your personal information that we may collect through your participation on our Site.
<br><br>
Defined terms (capitalized words) used in this policy are defined elsewhere -- in our Site's Terms of Use. Any general terms and conditions for the enforcement and application of this Policy (e.g., Governing Law, etc.) may also be found in our Terms of Use.
<br><br>
If you wish to raise any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or make any suggestions for its improvement, please contact us at the address at the bottom of this page.
<br><br>
<b>Personal Information in our Profiles</b>
<br><br>
PeekYou is an on-line, open content collaborative directory that is about and compiled by individuals. Our Contributors develop Profiles that show significant links and items of information that are already available on the Web about friends, family members and associates. Subject to the limitations in our Terms of Use, we allow anyone with an Internet connection and World Wide Web browser to log on, and alter or update any Profile. The resulting Profiles are then displayed to the public at PeekYou.com. Please use discretion when posting personal information -- make sure that it is accurate and not intended to embarrass, or to wrongly harm anyone's reputation. Don't post any information that you wouldn't want posted about yourself.
<br><br>
<b>Other Information Collection and Use</b>
<br><br>
In order to better serve our Users, we also record limited, non-personally identifiable information reported by your browser as you use our Site. This may include: IP address, browser type, time and date of use, and any activity performed while on our Site or using our services. We may also place and/or read cookies on your computer to help us see whether you have visited our Site in the past so we can customize our services and your experience. PeekYou records the Web site that referred you to our Site, but otherwise we do not gather information about Web pages you have visited before or after visiting our Site.
<br><br>
PeekYou may aggregate subsets of non-personally identifiable customer data for the purpose of understanding our customer base, determining how we may serve you better, and enhancing the services that we and our customers can provide you.
<br><br>
PeekYou collects a limited amount of personally identifiable information upon registering you as a Member. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information that you submit to us during registration, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, though we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Members benefit from submitting this information through being able to:
<br>
<ul>
    <li> Send messages other members;</li>
    <li> Track their additions/edits to PeekYou;</li>
    <li> Create a watch list so you can closely follow changes to your favorite profiles; and</li>
    <li> Subject to their stated preferences, from time to time we may use personal e-mail addresses to send them information and keep them informed of products and services in which they might be interested.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
You will always be provided with an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such information. Your contact information may also be used to reach you regarding issues concerning your use of our services or our Site including changes to this privacy policy. Your information may also be used to assist in the better targeting of search results and advertising as part of your use of this service.
<br><br>
<b>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</b>
<br><br>
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our services as a Member, you may update or delete your Member information by logging in with your username and password in and making the change. You may also e-mail your request to update or delete your information using our support form at www.peekyou.com/XXXX, by contacting PeekYou by telephone or postal mail through the contact information shown at the bottom of this policy.
<br><br>
<b>Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information</b>
<br><br>
PeekYou will not sell, rent, license or otherwise share the personally identifiable contact information (i.e., your registration e-mail address, billing address, etc.) that you submit in the context of registration for our services or that we otherwise collect. If you register for a PeekYou event with a third-party speaker, your personally identifiable contact information will generally be shared with the speaker.
<br><br>
Information that you may provide, at your discretion, in creating or updating your Profile, however, is intended for public disclosure and thus can be viewed by third parties.
<br><br>
<b>Unsubscribe/Opt-Out Requests</b>
<br><br>
PeekYou gives you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes. If you no longer wish to receive a newsletter or promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in the communication or by visiting http://www.peekyou.com/unsubscribe. After we receive your request, we will send you an e-mail message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed.
<br><br>
You may also communicate your opt-out request to PeekYou by telephone or postal mail by using the contact information at the bottom of this privacy policy.
<br><br>
<b>Third-Party Advertisers</b>
<br><br>
PeekYou.com allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to PeekYou.com's cookies.
<br><br>
<b>Third Party Service Providers</b>
<br><br>
PeekYou may use other parties to provide us with information regarding our customers' activities on our Site. They may set cookies on our behalf and receive information about your browsing activity on our Site. Additionally, using such a service, we may store personally identifiable information that you have provided to us, such as your name and e-mail address. PeekYou pledges that it will obtain the commitment from any such third party not to sell or make available any of your personal information to other third parties, or use it themselves to market products and services not related to our Site.
<br><br>
<b>Disclosures under Law</b>
<br><br>
We make every effort to preserve user privacy. However we intend to cooperate with legal authorities in order to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on PeekYou.
<br><br>
<b>Children</b>
<br><br>
The services of PeekYou are prohibited for children under the age of 13. You may not submit information about yourself or any other child to PeekYou if you are under 13, and, if you do, PeekYou reserves the right to remove any such information from its service at its own discretion.
<br><br>
<b>Sharing of Public Profile Information</b>
<br><br>
All information that is contributed by our Users for inclusion in their public Profiles, in addition to that collected by us from public Web sources, will be available to PeekYou and anyone using the PeekYou Site and other PeekYou services. If you would like us to remove your Profile from our service, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:remove@[REMOVE_THIS]peekyou.com">remove@peekyou.com</a> with your request and the Web address of your Profile, and we will gladly remove your information.
<br><br>
NOTE: Most of the information that PeekYou displays can already be found on any public search engine. Because the Web is constantly changing, and we search millions of new and old Web pages every day, we may re-acquired your information unintentionally. We recommend that you check our Site from time to time to ensure that your Profile contains only the information you choose to have displayed, and that we have not re-posted previously deleted information. The best way to avoid having your information found by our search engine (or any other search engine) is to contact the operator of the Site that contains the original source(s) of the information and ask for that operator to remove the displayed information from the Web.
<br><br>
