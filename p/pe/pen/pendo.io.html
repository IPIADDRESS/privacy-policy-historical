            <p>We at Pendo.io, Inc. (“Pendo,” “we,” “us,” “our”) know that our users (“you,” “your”) care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how Pendo.io, Inc. collects and uses the personal information you provide on our Website and Service. By visiting or using the Website or Service in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and you hereby consent to us collecting, using, and sharing your information in the following ways. Any capitalized terms used, but not defined have the meaning given to them in the Pendo Terms of Service (<a href="https://www.pendo.io/terms-of-service/">www.pendo.io/terms-of-service</a>).</p>
<h3>USER CONSENT</h3>
<p>By submitting or making available Application Data or any information by which you can be identified, including without limitation, your name, address, phone number, location data or other online identifier, (the “Personal Data”) through our Website, Service or related services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Application Data and Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>
<h3>THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS AND CHILDREN UNDER 13</h3>
<p>While the Website may link to third party websites or other third party provided content, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. The collection and use of your information by such third parties is governed by their terms of use and privacy policies.  We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service. No one under age 13 should provide any Personal Data to us or via the Website or Service.</p>
<h3>PRIVACY SHIELD</h3>
<p>Pendo complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland. Pendo has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (the “Principles”) and commits to subject all personal data received from the EU or Switzerland to the Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Principles, the Principles will govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Pendo remains responsible for any of your Personal Data that is shared under the onward transfer principle with third parties for external processing on our behalf, as described in the “DOES PENDO SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?” section below.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Principles, Pendo commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. If you are a resident of the European Union or Switzerland with inquiries or complaints regarding your personal data within the scope of Privacy Shield, you should contact Pendo’s Data Protection/Compliance Officer at gdpr@pendo.io. Under Privacy Shield, organizations must respond to individuals within 45 days of receiving a complaint. Pendo will endeavor to respond to your inquiry promptly.</p>
<p>If we are unable to resolve any complaint related to Privacy Shield or if we fail to acknowledge your complaint in a timely fashion you may refer a complaint to your local data protection authority. Pendo has committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU or Switzerland. We will work with them to address complaints and provide appropriate recourse free of charge to you. In certain circumstances, Privacy Shield provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Principles.</p>
<p>Pendo’s Privacy Shield compliance is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. We may be required to disclose Personal Data that we handle under the Privacy Shield in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<h3>WHAT INFORMATION DOES PENDO COLLECT?</h3>
<p>We gather various types of Personal Data from our users to personalize and improve the Service, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill users’ requests for Service, to analyze how users utilize the Website and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We collect the following types of information:</p>
<p>A. <u>Personal Data You Provide to Us:</u> We receive and store any information you provide to us. For example, we collect Personal Data such as your name, email address, and browser information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may anonymize your Personal Data so that you cannot be individually identified and provide that information to our partners.</p>
<p>B. <u>Your customers’ Personal Data:</u> In order to provide you with the Service, if you install certain software code provided by us on your website, we also receive and store any information you choose to provide to us with respect to your customers (“Your Customers”). For more information on how we collect and compile Your Customers’ information, please refer to our Terms of Service (<a href="https://www.pendo.io/terms-of-service/">www.pendo.io/terms-of-service</a>).</p>
<p>In order to provide the Service to you, you must provide us with a unique identifier for each of Your Customers. We encourage you to use a unique identifier that does not include Your Customers’ Personal Data; however, your information with respect to the Service will consist of any information, including any of Your Customers’ Personal Data, you choose to provide to us. Pendo does not collect any user-entered form field text in the application. </p>
<p>You should avoid sending any of the following types of sensitive personal information to Pendo on behalf of yourself or Your Customers: government-issued identification numbers; financial information (such as credit or debit card numbers, any related security codes or passwords, or bank account numbers); information related to an individual’s physical or mental health and information related to the provision of health care or payment for health care services. Remember, you are responsible for ensuring you comply with local laws and regulations regarding Your Customers’ Personal Data and other privacy and security obligations, including without limitation, as applicable, maintaining a privacy policy, sending appropriate notices to Your Customers, obtaining any necessary consent and providing opt-out opportunities.</p>
<p>C. <u>Information Collected Automatically:</u> Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record “cookie” information on our server logs. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when you visit pages in our Website. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to prevent or limit your computer or device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our Website’s features. To learn more about our use of cookies please review our Cookie Policy (<a href="https://www.pendo.io/cookiepolicy/">www.pendo.io/cookiepolicy</a>). If you click on a link to a third party website, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.</p>
<p>When you visit the Website, whether as a registered Pendo customer or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record certain information from your browser (“Log Data”). For example, Log Data may include information such as your computer’s internet protocol address, browser type, the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access times and dates and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Website and the Service, for the Website’s technical administration, to increase our Website’s functionality and user-friendliness and to better tailor the Website to our visitors’ needs.</p>
<p>D. <u>E-mail and Other Communications:</u> We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may communicate with you about your use of the Website or Service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by adjusting the settings on your account screen in the Website. Please note that we will send you legal notices governing your use of the Website and any other legally required notices for as long as you are a user of the Website or Service, even if you elect not to receive other kinds of communications from us.</p>
<h3>DOES PENDO SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
<p>We share customer information only as described below:</p>
<p>A. <u>Third-Party Service Providers:</u> We provide personal information to a limited number of third-party providers (“Providers”) to process it for us or to perform functions on our behalf, based on our instructions, and pursuant to the Onward Transfer Principle of Privacy Shield. Our Providers perform their services for us in compliance with our Privacy Policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We enter into contracts with our Providers which limit data processing to processing only for specified purposes and require our Providers to provide the same level of confidentiality protection as Pendo. We may have liability under Privacy Shield if both (i) the provider processes the personal data in a manner inconsistent with Privacy Shield and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<p>B. <u>Third-Party Business Partners:</u> Pendo partners with a variety of businesses and works closely with them to market or sell products or services (“Partners”). We may disclose Personal Data to our Partners for the purposes described above. Some of our Partners may co-sponsor events and other offerings with Pendo. We may share Personal Data you provide to us when you sign up for events or other offering with these Partners so they can send you marketing communications and information that may interest you, as permitted under applicable law. You will be notified, prior to sharing any Personal Data, that the event for which you are signing up is co-sponsored and that our Partner may use the information shared to communicate with you or market to you.  At such time, you may elect not to provide your Personal Data to us or to our Partner for such purposes.</p>
<p>C. <u>Blog and Social Media Pages:</u> You may disclose Personal Data through the Pendo website, on message boards, chat, profile pages, blogs and other services to which you are able to post information and materials (including, without limitation, our Pendo Blog, at <a href="http://blog.pendo.io">http://blog.pendo.io</a>, the ProductCraft site at <a href="http://www.productcraft.com">http://www.productcraft.com</a> and the Pendo’s social media pages). This information may appear publicly, such as through search engines or other publicly available platforms and may be “crawled” or searched by third parties. Please do not post any information that you do not want to reveal to the public at large.</p>
<p>D. <u>Legal Reasons:</u> We may share Personal Data outside of Pendo if reasonably necessary to (i) comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process or enforceable governmental requests; or (ii) protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Pendo, our customers, or the public as permitted by law.</p>
<p>E. <u>With Consent:</u> Pendo does not sell your information and will not use customer data for any reason beyond those described in this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.</p>
<h3>WHERE DOES PENDO STORE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
<p>Data submitted to Pendo and Pendo’s application are hosted and stored in a secure, multi-tenant environment provided by Google’s Cloud Platform. Data is stored for each customer using separate Google AppEngine namespaces and a variety of techniques for logical separation to ensure that no data is co-mingled. The Google physical architecture that hosts Pendo is located in the United States. By submitting information, you agree to its transfer, storage or processing in the United States. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>IS THE PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE?</h3>
