		<p>We at Pendo.io, Inc. (“Pendo,” “we,” “us,” “our”) know that our users (“you,” “your”) care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy describes how Pendo.io, Inc. collects and uses the personal information you provide on our Website, www.pendo.io, and Service, app.pendo.io. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting or using the Website or Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways. Any capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning given to them in the Pendo Terms of Use (<a href="http://www.pendo.io/terms-of-service">www.pendo.io/terms-of-service</a>).</p>
<p><strong>USER CONSENT</strong></p>
<p>By submitting or making available Application Data or Personal Data through our website, products, or related services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Application Data and Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website or Services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Services (as that term is defined in our Terms of Use). No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to us or on the Services.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DOES PENDO COLLECT?</strong></p>
<p>We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained more fully below. We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve the Services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for the Services, to analyze how users utilize the Website, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We collect the following types of information:</p>
<p>A. Information You Provide to Us:
Your Personal Information: We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, and browser information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners.</p>
<p>Your Customers’ Personal Information: In order to provide you with the Services, we also receive and store any information you choose to provide us with respect to your customers (“End User Customers”). The End User Customer information (“End User Customer Information”) we receive and store may include email addresses of your customers, but will consist of any information you choose to provide us with.</p>
<p>B. Information Collected Automatically:
Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited by you. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to prevent or limit your computer or device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our Website’s features. If you click on a link to a third party website, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.</p>
<p>When you visit the Website, whether as an Pendo customer or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). For example, Log Data may include information such as your computer’s IP address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Website and the Services and for the Website’s technical administration, to increase our Website’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, as part of our provision of the Services to you, if you install certain software code provided by us on your website, we will also track and collect End User Customer usage information on your website. For more information on how we collect and compile End User Customer Information, please see Section below.</p>
<p>C. E-mail and Other Communications:
We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may communicate with you about your use of the Website or Services. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by adjusting the settings on your account screen in the Website. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Website, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE DOES PENDO STORE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>If you are located outside the United States, the information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored and processed at, a destination in the United States. By submitting information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>IS THE PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE?</strong></p>
<p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. The transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
<p>When you enter your information on our site we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site’s privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?</strong></p>
<p>Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>name and password</li>
<li>email address</li>
<li>company name</li>
<li>location or time zone</li>
</ul>
<p>The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Website changes. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at support@pendo.io. We will respond to your request to access within 10 days.</p>
<p>Testimonials
We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. To request removal of your personal information from Testimonials or comments please contact us at support@pendo.io</p>
<p><strong>WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?</strong></p>
<p>You can always opt not to disclose information to use, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our special features. You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained in the section above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. You may request deletion of your account by contacting us at support@pendo.io. Please note that some information may remain in our private records after your deletion of such information from your account. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.</p>
<p>To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at support@pendo.io. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make material changes or changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will by posting an announcement on our Website. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Website after such changes have been first posted.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message at support@pendo.io. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.  310 South Harrington Street, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States of America.</p>
