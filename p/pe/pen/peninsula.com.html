You are not required to provide the Data. However, if you elect not to supply the Data as requested from each specific service, we may be unable to deliver you the all the features that we offer.<br><br>

<b>How Secure is the Data?</b><br><br>
To maintain the accuracy of the Data, as well as preventing from unauthorized access and ensuring the correct use of the Data, we have carried out appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure the Data we collect online.<br><br>
We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol - an industry standard for encryption over the Internet, to protect the Data. When you type in sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into codes before being securely dispatched over the Internet.<br><br>
The website has a firewall in place, which should protect the Data collected from you against unauthorized or accidental access. However, complete confidentiality and security is not yet possible over the Internet, and privacy cannot be assured in your communications to us. You acknowledge that personal information is disclosed at your own risk, and may be subject to unauthorized use by others. This may result in you receiving unsolicited messages from other parties. We are not responsible in any manner for direct, indirect, special or consequential damages, howsoever caused arising out of the communication of information to us.<br><br>
<b>What About Cookies and Log Files?</b><br><br>

A cookie is a piece of information about the user that a website can send to your web browser, which may then store it on your computer system. With the use of cookies, we can better serve you when you return to our site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future.<br><br>

We may collect information regarding your IP address, browser type, domain name and access time. This information is used for our own research and analysis purposes and is separate from the Data. We do not link IP addresses to any personal information. In rare instances, IP addresses may be used to assist in deterring and/or preventing abusive or criminal activity on the website.<br><br>

<b>The Peninsula Hotels Legal Notices</b><br><br>
