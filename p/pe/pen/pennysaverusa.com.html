<p><b>How Data are Collected</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<u>Usage Statistics</u><br>
		When someone accesses one of the sites listed above, a session ID is
		generated on our server corresponding to this specific visit. No personal
		data is available from this connection (i.e. name or email address) apart
		from the IP of the Internet Service Provider that was used to connect to
		the site. The purpose of this session ID is to generate usage statistics
		for the site in total as well as provide the capability to compare usage
		statistics for certain sections of the site. This information is
		automatically generated for every person that visits one of our sites. As
		an example, with these data, we are able to say "X" number of
		people visited our site last month compared to "Y" a year ago.
	</li>
	<li>
		<u>Cookies</u><br>
		Cookies are generated within certain sections of our site when it is
		important to save information submitted by a visitor on prior pages or to
		store visitors' preferences. Examples of this include placing an ad or
		using the ad clipboard to save certain ads for later viewing.
	</li>
	<li>
		<u>Information Submitted for Ad Placement, Contests, Surveys and Site
		Registration</u><br>
		Much of the data we collect from visitors is voluntarily provided by
		visitors while completing online forms to place a classified ad or enter a
		reader contest. The information we request is name, address, phone number,
		city, state, Zip Code, email address and year of birth.
	</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Data Collected and Saved for Harte-Hanks Internal Purposes:</b></p>

<p>The information we collect is used to notify consumers about advertising they
are requesting, contest results, updates to our Web site and is used by us to
contact consumers for marketing purposes. In some cases, some parts of our site
that invite you to submit an e-mail to us will result in an automatic reply from
us letting you know immediately that your e-mail wasreceived successfully. In
another case, when you submit an online advertisement with us, we will confirm
the details of the ad placement using a unique e-mail message to you. Subsequent
e-mail messages are used appropriately to resolve any concerns you may have when
placing such PennySaver/Flyer ads (and we are also available by telephone).</p>

<p>If you do not want to receive marketing e-mail from us in the future, please
let us know by <a href="#optout">opting out below</a>.</p>

<p><b>Data Collected and Shared with Harte-Hanks Partners:</b></p>

<p>From time to time, we make the information of those who access our site
available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think
you might find interesting. In the case of sponsoredcontests, we may share your
entry information with the sponsoring partner or partners for their own
subsequent use. In these cases, these partners may have their own privacy
policies with which you may check.</p>

<p>If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with other companies or
organizations, please let us know by <a href="#optout">opting out below</a>.</p>

<p><b>Additional Items:</b></p>

<p>With respect to Ad Servers: We do not partner currently with or have
special relationships with any ad server companies. (Ad servers are companies
that place banner ads or pop-up ads of other unaffiliated companies on Web
sites.)</p>

<p>From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated
uses not previously disclosedin our privacy notice. If our information
practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes
to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability
to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information
is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.</p>

<p>If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy,
you may contact us at the address, phone number or email address at the top of
this policy.</p>

<p><a name="optout"></a><b>Email Opt-Out:</b></p>

<p>Please enter your email address if you would like to be removed from our
email list. Doing so indicates that you would not like to receive information
regarding marketing or promotional events or have your information shared with
one of our partners. Please note that if you are a customer of the PennySaver
or Flyer publications you may continue to receive business related information
to your email address.</p>
