Be aware, however, that third parties, including its partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through its Site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p> </section> <section><h4>Newsletters:</h4><p>If you wish to subscribe to the PennyStockEgghead.com newsletter(s), Egghead will use your email address to send the newsletter to you.</p> </section> <section><h4>Choice/Opt-Out:</h4><p>Egghead will provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of receiving its newsletter, in which case your email address is permanently removed from its database.
