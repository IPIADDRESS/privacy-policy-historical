			    <p>We recognise the importance of privacy and are committed to protecting your
			    privacy when handling your personal information.<br>
			    <br>
			    This Privacy Policy explains how we handle personal information in an open and
			    transparent manner in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles contained in
			    the&nbsp;<em>Privacy Act 1988</em>&nbsp;(Cth) (“Privacy Act”) and other
			    applicable privacy laws.&nbsp;Personal information is information or an opinion about
			    an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.<br>
			    <br>
			    This Privacy Policy will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new or
			    amended laws, new technology and/or changes to our operations and practices and the
			    changing business environment. All personal information held by us will be governed
			    by the most recently updated policy. This Privacy Policy addresses the following:
			    &nbsp;</p>

			    <ul>
			      <li>what information we collect;</li>

			      <li>if you are a minor (aged under 18 years);</li>

			      <li>how we collect information;</li>

			      <li>why we collect it;</li>

			      <li>how we use it;</li>

			      <li>how we disclose it;</li>

			      <li>opting in or out;</li>

			      <li>how we hold it – management and security;</li>

			      <li>accessing and updating or correcting your information and how to contact
			      us.</li>
			    </ul>

			    <p><strong>What information we collect</strong></p>

			    <p>The personal information we may collect about you includes (but is not limited to)
			    your name, contact details (including phone numbers and addresses), gender, date of
			    birth, occupation, transaction information and other information which may assist us
			    in conducting our business, and providing and marketing our products and services. In
			    certain circumstances we collect financial information, including your credit card
			    information where appropriate.<br>
			    <br>
			    We also collect information about you that is not personal information. For example,
			    we may collect data relating to your activity on our websites (including the type of
			    internet browser you use, your operating system, address of referring site, your IP
			    address and other clickstream information) via tracking technologies such as cookies,
			    or we may collect information from you in response to a survey, promotion or
			    competition. We may use Google Analytic tools from time to time including
			    Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign
			    Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. We
			    generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our
			    services, diagnose problems, advertise online, optimize our advertising and websites
			    and target and improve the quality of our products and services.<br>
			    <br>
			    Cookies allow your browser to utilise some of the features of our websites. We use
			    both session ID cookies and persistent cookies, first party cookies (such as Google
			    Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together
			    to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website, to
			    report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these
			    ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site. Third-party
			    vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet. Most web
			    browsers are set by default to accept cookies. If you reject cookies you will be
			    unable to take advantage of some of the features of our websites. To the extent this
			    information does not constitute personal information, the Privacy Act is not
			    applicable and we may use this information for any lawful purpose.<br>
			    <br>
			    We generally advise that you do not publish or communicate personal information, or
			    at least limit the personal information that you publish or communicate, to the
			    public via our services, such as in any forums, blogs or anywhere that user generated
			    content can be uploaded ("Non-Confidential Information"). We cannot control any third
			    party collection or use of your Non-Confidential Information that is publicly
			    available.<br>
			    <br>
			    <strong>If you are a minor (aged under 18 years)</strong>&nbsp;<br>
			    <br>
			    We provide subscription services to children and young adults who are legally minors
			    and may not be able to provide valid consent to our collection, use, disclosure,
			    storage or other handling of their personal information. From time to time we may
			    also conduct competitions and other promotional activities and provide other services
			    for children/minors who may or may not be subscribers to our online services or
			    newsletters.<br>
			    <br>
			    Parents and guardians of children/minors are personally responsible for monitoring
			    their child’s/minor's access to, and use of, our services and for providing
			    valid approvals for their child’s/minor's participation in subscription,
			    competitions and other promotional activities conducted by us.<br>
			    <br>
			    If you are a child or young adult under the age of 18 years, you must ask your parent
			    or legal guardian to approve your provision of personal information before you submit
			    your personal details to us.<br>
			    <br>
			    <strong>How we collect information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
			    <br>
			    We may collect your personal information from a variety of sources, including from
			    you, advertisers, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business
			    partners.<br>
			    <br>
			    We will generally collect personal information by way of forms filled out by people,
			    face-to-face meetings, interviews, business cards, electronic communications,
			    telephone conversations and from third parties (including representatives, agents and
			    credit reporting agencies). In addition, we collect personal information from our
			    websites and social media web pages (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and
			    Tumblr) through receiving subscription applications, job applications, competition
			    applications, promotion entries (including posts, comments/likes, messages and votes)
			    and other electronic documents and information.<br>
			    <br>
			    We may collect your personal information when you request or acquire a product or
			    service from us, register with us as a subscriber or member, provide a product or
			    service to us, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition or event,
			    contribute in a fundraising event, participate in our services (including blogs and
			    forums) or when you communicate with us electronically (including email and
			    facsimile), by telephone or in writing (for example if you make a complaint or
			    provide feedback).<br>
			    <br>
			    If, at any time, you provide personal or other information about someone other than
			    yourself, you must have that person's consent to provide such information for the
			    purpose for which you provide it to us.<br>
			    <br>
			    <strong>Why we collect it</strong>&nbsp;<br>
			    <br>
			    The primary purpose for which we collect information about you is to conduct our
			    business, provide and market our products and services or products and services of
			    other members of the Penguin Random House Group to you, meet our legal or regulatory

			    us and the administration of any accounts you have with us. We may state a more

			    not be able to provide you with our products or services or market our products and
			    services or products and services of other members of the Penguin Random House Group
			    to you. For example, if you do not register as a member of a website, you will not be
			    able to access features or services that are reserved for members or subscribers
			    only.<br>

			    secure premises, locked cabinets, firewalls, password access, secure servers and
			    encryption of credit card transactions.<br>

			    However, you acknowledge that the security of online transactions and the security of
			    communications sent by electronic means or by post cannot be guaranteed. You provide
			    information to us via the internet or by post at your own risk. We cannot accept
			    responsibility for misuse, interference or loss, or unauthorised access, modification
			    or disclosure in respect of your personal information where the security of the
			    information is not within our control.<br>
			    <br>

			    or disclosure in respect of your personal information, or any other privacy breach
			    please let us know immediately.<br>

			    you, or if you have any questions or require a complaint dealt with about how we
