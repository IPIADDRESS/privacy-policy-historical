    <p>In this Privacy Policy, "us", "we" or "our" means Penguin Random House Australia
    Pty Ltd (ABN 28 004 815 703) and its divisions and related bodies corporate.</p>

    <p>We recognise the importance of privacy and are committed to protecting your
    privacy when handling your personal information.<br>
    <br>
    This Privacy Policy explains how we handle personal information in an open and
    transparent manner in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles contained in
    the&nbsp;<em>Privacy Act 1988</em>&nbsp;(Cth) (“Privacy Act”) and other
    applicable privacy laws.&nbsp;Personal information is information or an opinion about
    an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.<br>
    <br>
    This Privacy Policy will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new or
    amended laws, new technology and/or changes to our operations and practices and the
    changing business environment. All personal information held by us will be governed
    by the most recently updated policy. This Privacy Policy addresses the following:
    &nbsp;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>what information we collect;</li>

      <li>if you are a minor (aged under 18 years);</li>

      <li>how we collect information;</li>

      <li>why we collect it;</li>

      <li>how we use it;</li>

      <li>how we disclose it;</li>

      <li>opting in or out;</li>

      <li>how we hold it – management and security;</li>

      <li>accessing and updating or correcting your information and how to contact
      us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What information we collect</strong></p>

    <p>The personal information we may collect about you includes (but is not limited to)
    your name, contact details (including phone numbers and addresses), gender, date of
    birth, occupation, transaction information and other information which may assist us
    in conducting our business, and providing and marketing our products and services. In
    certain circumstances we collect financial information, including your credit card
    information where appropriate.<br>
    <br>
    We also collect information about you that is not personal information. For example,
    we may collect data relating to your activity on our websites (including the type of
    internet browser you use, your operating system, address of referring site, your IP
    address and other clickstream information) via tracking technologies such as cookies,
    or we may collect information from you in response to a survey, promotion or
    competition. We may use Google Analytic tools from time to time including
    Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign
    Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. We
    generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our
    services, diagnose problems, advertise online, optimize our advertising and websites
    and target and improve the quality of our products and services.<br>
    <br>
    Cookies allow your browser to utilise some of the features of our websites. We use
    both session ID cookies and persistent cookies, first party cookies (such as Google
    Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together
    to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website, to
    report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these
    ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site. Third-party
    vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet. Most web
    browsers are set by default to accept cookies. If you reject cookies you will be
    unable to take advantage of some of the features of our websites. To the extent this
    information does not constitute personal information, the Privacy Act is not
    applicable and we may use this information for any lawful purpose.<br>
    <br>
    We generally advise that you do not publish or communicate personal information, or
    at least limit the personal information that you publish or communicate, to the
    public via our services, such as in any forums, blogs or anywhere that user generated
    content can be uploaded ("Non-Confidential Information"). We cannot control any third
    party collection or use of your Non-Confidential Information that is publicly
    available.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>If you are a minor (aged under 18 years)</strong>&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    We provide subscription services to children and young adults who are legally minors
    and may not be able to provide valid consent to our collection, use, disclosure,
    storage or other handling of their personal information. From time to time we may
    also conduct competitions and other promotional activities and provide other services
    for children/minors who may or may not be subscribers to our online services or
    newsletters.<br>
    <br>
    Parents and guardians of children/minors are personally responsible for monitoring
    their child’s/minor's access to, and use of, our services and for providing
    valid approvals for their child’s/minor's participation in subscription,
    competitions and other promotional activities conducted by us.<br>
    <br>
    If you are a child or young adult under the age of 18 years, you must ask your parent
    or legal guardian to approve your provision of personal information before you submit
    your personal details to us.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>How we collect information</strong>&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    We may collect your personal information from a variety of sources, including from
    you, advertisers, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business
    partners.<br>
    <br>
    We will generally collect personal information by way of forms filled out by people,
    face-to-face meetings, interviews, business cards, electronic communications,
    telephone conversations and from third parties (including representatives, agents and
    credit reporting agencies). In addition, we collect personal information from our
    websites and social media web pages (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and
    Tumblr) through receiving subscription applications, job applications, competition
    applications, promotion entries (including posts, comments/likes, messages and votes)
    and other electronic documents and information.<br>
    <br>
    We may collect your personal information when you request or acquire a product or
    service from us, register with us as a subscriber or member, provide a product or
    service to us, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition or event,
    contribute in a fundraising event, participate in our services (including blogs and
    forums) or when you communicate with us electronically (including email and
    facsimile), by telephone or in writing (for example if you make a complaint or
    provide feedback).<br>
    <br>
    If, at any time, you provide personal or other information about someone other than
    yourself, you must have that person's consent to provide such information for the
    purpose for which you provide it to us.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Why we collect it</strong>&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The primary purpose for which we collect information about you is to conduct our
    business, provide and market our products and services or products and services of
    other members of the Penguin Random House Group to you, meet our legal or regulatory
    obligations, and also for the management of business transactions entered into with
    us and the administration of any accounts you have with us. We may state a more
    specific purpose at the point we collect your information (including but not limited
    to any law that requires or authorises the particular information to be
    collected).<br>
    <br>
    If you do not provide us with all or some of the information that we request, we may
    not be able to provide you with our products or services or market our products and
    services or products and services of other members of the Penguin Random House Group
    to you. For example, if you do not register as a member of a website, you will not be
    able to access features or services that are reserved for members or subscribers
    only.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>How we use it</strong>&nbsp;<br>

    <strong>Opting in or out</strong>&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    At the point we collect information from you, you may be asked to "opt in" to consent
