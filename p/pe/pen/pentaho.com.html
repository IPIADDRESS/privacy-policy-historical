		<p>Pentaho is committed to protecting the privacy of users of our site. As part of the normal operation of this site, we 
		collect information from you. This Privacy Statement describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to 
		that information.</p>
        
		<h3>INFORMATION GATHERED THROUGH PENTAHO WEB SITES:</h3>
        
		<p>Pentaho tracks the domains from which people visit Pentaho and analyze this data for trends and statistics. Subject to the 
		provisions of this Privacy Statement, Pentaho may use accumulated data for various purposes, including but not limited to 
		marketing analysis, service evaluation and planning.</p>
        
		<p>Currently, Pentaho uses personal information as a basis for notifications to users, "opt-in" emails, and in order 
		to implement some of the terms of the Terms and Conditions of Use governing the website (the "Terms"). User names 
		and email addresses (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) are publicly available on the 
		Pentaho site. When users voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information that may contain Registration Data, or 
		otherwise post personal information in conjunction with content subject to an Open Source license, such personal information 
		necessarily will be disclosed subject to the terms of the license. An example of such a disclosure includes, but is not limited 
		to, a user's disclosure of personal information as part of a message posted to a public message forum, or a publicly-released 
		software application.</p>
        
		<p>Pentaho may conduct surveys of other studies of its customer base and usage for marketing and planning purposes. With respect 
		to information collected from such surveys or studies, and in the event that responses are to be publicly disclosed, users 
		will be notified at the time they take the survey and Pentaho will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users 
		and not personal information identifying any specific individual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases where surveys allow 
		users to submit written comments, and where Pentaho advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take 
		the survey, Pentaho reserves the right to disclose text information provided by any user through such a survey, provided that 
		no personal information identifying that user is disclosed. Participation in such surveys is at the user's option; Pentaho 
		does not conduct mandatory surveys. Circumstances under which Pentaho would publicly disclose such aggregate information 
		include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the site population and publicizing overall usage data in press 
		communications.</p>
        
		<p>Cookies: Pentaho employs "cookies" to provide a user with tailored information. A "cookie" is an element 
		of data that a Service or site, when visited by a user, sends to that user's browser that, in turn, may store that element on 
		the user's hard drive or memory. Pentaho uses cookies to better serve users who use our Services; any cookies sent by Pentaho 
		will be marked so that they will be accessible only by websites subject to this Privacy Statement. However, at his or her 
		option, and at his or her sole expense and responsibility, any user may block or delete our cookies from his or her hard drive. 
		By disabling cookies, however, certain site features and functionality may no longer work properly, or at all.</p>
        
		<p>Other Notification: In order to implement or enforce the Terms of Pentaho, Pentaho may use personal information to contact 
		users on an individual basis.</p>
        
		<p>At no time, unless law requires such disclosure, disclosure is necessary to aid law enforcement, or a user specifically 
		authorizes such disclosure, will Pentaho disclose individual user personal information that is not publicly available to 
		unrelated third parties.</p>
        
		<h3>LINKS WITH OTHER SITES</h3>
        
		<p>Pentaho contains links to other websites, whether owned or controlled by Pentaho affiliates or unrelated third parties. Please 
		note that the privacy policies of these sites may differ from those of Pentaho. Pentaho is not responsible for the privacy 
		policies and practices of any linked website. We encourage you to read the privacy statement of any website you may visit.</p>
        
		<h3>CHOICE</h3>
        
		<p>"Opt-in" Emails: Users may "opt-in" to receive site notifications, newsletters or other information via 
		email. Users may remove themselves from such services at their discretion. Any email sent to an "opt-in" list will 
		include directions for how a user may remove himself or herself from the list, or a URL where the user may find such directions.</p>
        
		<p>Profile Display: In some cases, users' personal information may be publicly available through a user's profile display.</p>
        
		<p>In such cases, users have the option to opt out of publicly displaying their real names. In cases where site profiles allow 
		users to display optional information publicly, such entry and display is at the user's discretion and may be changed at any 
		time by the user.</p>
        
		<p>Email Display: In some cases, users may have the opportunity to use a Service to send electronic mail to another user. In 
		such cases, a user's valid email address and real name will be included with such messages. In order to prevent abuse, users 
		may not opt-out of such a display, but may choose to refrain from using said Service to transmit an email message.</p>
        
		<h3>ACCESS</h3>
        <p>Users can view their data on their personal profile page. When technically feasible, users are permitted to update their 
		personal information directly through Pentaho Service. When such updating service is not technically feasible, Pentaho will 
		make reasonable efforts to assist users in updating their personal information.</p>
        <h3>SECURITY</h3>
        
		<p>To secure site integrity, Pentaho employs measures including but not limited to security audits, use of encryption tools 
		and software, and other reasonable security measures and procedures.Internal access to users' private and nonpublic personal 
		information is restricted to site administrators and individuals on a need-to-know basis.</p>
        
		<h3>ENFORCEMENT</h3>
        <p>In the event that Pentaho becomes aware that site security is compromised or user nonpublic information has been disclosed to 
		unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including but not limited to external security attacks, Pentaho shall 
		take reasonable measures which it deems appropriate, including but not limited to internal investigation and reporting, and 
		notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities, notwithstanding other provisions of this Statement.</p>
        
		<p>If Pentaho becomes aware that a user's personal information provided to Pentaho has been disclosed in a manner not permitted 
		by this Privacy Statement, Pentaho shall make reasonable efforts to notify the affected user, as soon as reasonably possible 
		and as permitted by law, of what information has been disclosed, to the extent that Pentaho knows this information.</p>
        
		<h3>UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY STATEMENT</h3>
        
		<p>To substantively update the Privacy Statement, we will both post the changed version and its effective date on our website 
		at www.pentaho.com. Concurrently with any substantive change to the Privacy Statement, we will email notice of the change to 
		known users at least 15 days in advance (or such shorter or longer time as mandated by law or any judicial or government body).</p>
        
		<p>Text last modified on June 1, 2005. Formatting updated on September 21, 2006 (text unchanged).</p>
        
		<h3>NO GUARANTEES</h3>
        
		<p>While this Privacy Statement expresses Pentaho's standards for maintenance of private data, Pentaho is not in a position to 
		guarantee that the standards will always be met. There may be factors beyond our control that may result in disclosure of data. 
		As a consequence, Pentaho disclaims any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of private 
		information.</p>
