<font face="arial,geneva">

The PennLive Web site is maintained by PennLive, 3899 North Front Street, Harrisburg, PA 17110. We can be reached by e-mail at
<a href="mailto:feedback@pennlive.com">feedback@pennlive.com</a>.</font></p><p><font face="arial,geneva">

<b>HOW PennLive USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU:</b> This site does not collect
personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly
provided by such individuals. A user's personally identifiable information may be used by
PennLive and its affiliates for editorial purposes. PennLive may also use such
information for marketing and promotional purposes. We may share your personally identifiable
information with other companies with which it conducts business. For example, if you enter
our contests, make a purchase or use our e-mail services, we sometimes rely on outside companies
to provide these services to you. In such cases, we need to provide your personally identifiable
information to them. Or if you choose to purchase items through our commerce site, we will
forward your information to third parties for credit card processing and
order fulfillment. </font></p><p><font face="arial,geneva">

We also sometimes provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to
you that meet your needs. While PennLive will seek to require such third parties to follow
appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the
express purpose for which it was provided, PennLive does not bear any responsibility for
any actions or policies of any third parties.</font></p><p><font face="arial,geneva">

Except for purposes outlined above, we do not provide, sell or lease your personally identifiable
information to any third parties, unless otherwise stated at the time of collection. If you have
any questions or concerns regarding what is done with your information on any part of PennLive,
please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:feedback@pennlive.com">feedback@pennlive.com</a> before
submitting any information.</font></p><p><font face="arial,geneva">

We also collect anonymous, aggregated data and provide it to our advertisers and other companies
that we do business with for market research and statistical purposes. For example, we might report
to our advertisers that a certain percentage of users are between the ages of 30-35.</font></p><p><font face="arial,geneva">

Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information
(e.g., first and last name, address, e-mail address, etc.) on the forums or in the chat areas, that
information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other
posters or parties.</font></p><p><font face="arial,geneva">

<b>COOKIES:</b> PennLive may place a "cookie" in the browser files of PennLive user's
computer. The cookie may contain personally identifiable information. Cookies enable PennLive
to serve information that you have requested, or that relate to your use of PennLive
to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to PennLive. You also may
occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. PennLive does not control these cookies and
these cookies are not subject to this policy. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party
servers is common in the Internet industry. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.
If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being
sent. However, it is possible that some portions of PennLive will not function properly if
you do so. For further information on cookies and their use, see the help instructions delivered
with your browser or contact the browser's manufacturer. PennLive cannot provide help
regarding your browser's cookie settings.</font></p><p><font face="arial,geneva">

<b>CHILDREN:</b> Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about
yourself (your name, address, e-mail address, etc.) to us or anyone else over the Internet, and
before making any purchases online. If you are under the age of 13, you are not allowed to use this service. </font></p><p><font face="arial,geneva">

<b>PARENTS:</b> We encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage and to be
aware of the activities in which they are participating. This service is not intended for users under the age of 13. This service does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13.  Such users are expressly prohibited from submitting their personally identifiable information to us, and from using our forums and chat areas; any information submitted by such users will not knowingly be used, posted, or retained by us. Any personally identifiable information collected by PennLive from children above 13 (that we are aware are children above the age 13) will be used only for
PennLive internal purposes such as market research, sweepstakes fulfillment and for
fulfilling requests for information or materials, and may sometimes be included in our database.
However, such information will not be posted or published by us, or provided to any third parties,
without your prior consent. Additionally, anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to other
companies which we do business with, for statistical and market research purposes as described above. Finally, you should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses his name, e-mail address, etc. on various forums, or chat areas, such disclosure may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should discourage your child from doing so. </font></p><p><font face="arial,geneva">

Again, if you have any concerns regarding your child's or your use of PennLive, please
contact us at <a href="mailto:feedback@pennlive.com">feedback@pennlive.com</a>.
