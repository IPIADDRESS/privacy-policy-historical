The types of information we collect depend on the nature of your interaction with us</p>

<h4>Personal Information:</h4>

<p>Personal information typically includes your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. 
You can always choose not to provide us with any of your personal information. 
However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or 
information that you requested. For example, we can only offer you a Bid package if you 
have provided us with certain financial information.  With your consent we may use your 
personal information for a number of different purposes, for example to:</p>

For example: we may ask you for your postal code to assist us with planning our correspondence distribution.</p>

<ul>
<li>We may collect certain non-personal data when you visit our Web Site, such as the type of browser you are using or the referring URL.
</li><li>We may collect and summarize customer information in a non-personal, aggregate format for statistical and research purposes.

</li></ul>

</li><li>for other purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. 
</li></ul>

<h3>Your Implied Consent </h3>

<p>In some cases, your consent is implied if we ask you to provide personal information with 
a stated purpose. For example, we can only deliver the product you have purchased if you 
provide us with your address and phone number.</p>

<h3>Your Express Consent </h3>

<p>In other cases, we will ask you to give your express consent to use your 
personal information to advise you of products or services that may be of interest.

<p>Listed here are some further examples of the ways that we collect personal information directly from you and how we use it.</p>

<h3>On-Line Store and/or Auction Purchases </h3>

<p>When you purchase a Penny Auctions Canada product or service, you may need to 
provide us with contact and payment information (such as credit card information) 
so that we can process your request. Examples where we need contact information 
include delivery services, product servicing, in-home installations, warranty coverage, 
and rebate requests. If we collect this information, we will also ask for your consent 
to use this information to send you promotional information on products and services.</p>

</p><h3>Information Penny Auctions Canada Collects Automatically </h3>

<p>Like many other Web Sites, Penny Auctions Canada automatically collects certain 
non-personal information regarding Web Site users that does not identify you.  
Examples include the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, 
the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the 
Web Site, the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to the Web Site, 
the operating system you are using, the sections of the Web Site you visit,

<h3>Cookies </h3>

<p>Pennyauctionscanada.COM, the "Web Site", uses "cookies", a technology that 
installs a small amount of information on a Web Site user's computer to permit the 
Web Site to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience 
and use of the Web Site.  For example, the information provided through cookies is 
used to recognize you as a previous user of the Web Site (so you do not have to enter 
your billing information every time), to offer personalized Web page content and 
information for your use, to track your activity at the Web Site, to respond to your needs, 
and to otherwise facilitate and enhance your Web Site experience. You may choose to 
decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Web Site 
and your ability to access certain features of the Web Site or engage in transactions through the Web Site.</p>

<h3>Tracking Information </h3>

<p>We may use non-personal information, beacons or pixel tags to compile tracking information 
reports regarding Web Site user demographics, Web Site traffic patterns, and Web Site 
purchases, and then provide those reports to advertisers and others. None of the tracking 
information in the reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information 
of individual users. We may also link tracking information with personal information 
voluntarily provided by Web Site users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked 
information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only 
in accordance with this Policy.  </p>

</li></ul>

<h3>How does Penny Auctions Canada Protect My Information? </h3>

<p>The security of your personal information is a high priority for Penny Auctions Canada. 
We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security standards to protect your 
personal information, whether recorded on paper or captured electronically, against 
unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.  Although we cannot take responsibility 
for any theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction of data 
by a third party, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.  
For example, electronic records are stored in secure, limited-access servers; 
we employ technological tools like firewalls and passwords; 
and we ensure our employees are trained on the importance of maintaining the 
security and confidentiality of personal information.</p>

<h3>Choosing a Password</h3>

<p>When you create an online account on our Web Site, you need to select a personal password. 
To maximize your level of protection, you should choose at least 6 characters including 
a combination of both letters and numbers. You are solely responsible for maintaining 
the secrecy of your password and any account information. Penny Auctions Canada will 
never send an unsolicited communication asking you for your password or requesting that 
you update your account credentials. To learn more about Phishing and email fraud, please read below:

</p><h4>Learn about E-mail Fraud</h4>

<p>Phishing (also referred to as brand spoofing) is a type of scheme that uses 
fraudulent e-mail and web pages to gather personal, financial and sensitive 
information for the purpose of identity theft. Most commonly, users receive 
spam e-mail (mass e-mail messaging) and pop-up windows that appear to come from 
legitimate businesses. People have been tricked by these deceptive solicitations 
into sharing passwords and credit card, social security and bank account numbers.  
As an online user, you should always continue to take precautions including 
querying the origination of e-mails, the URLs that those e-mails purport to 
take you to, and paying close attention to the secure padlock icon on your Internet Browser. 
Additionally, you should always navigate the web using authentic Internet security software. 
The ONLY time Penny Auctions Canada collects your credit card information is when you 
are making an online purchase on our secure web site.  If you think you were the 
recipient of a phishing e-mail where you provided some information, please contact 
your credit card company immediately to determine what recourse you have available to you.  
Penny Auctions Canada is committed to protecting and ensuring your personal information 
remains private.  If you have any questions for Penny Auctions Canada, 
please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@pennyauctionscanada.com">privacy@pennyauctionscanada.com</a>.</p>

<h3>How Can You Verify Your Information?</h3>

<p>You may check your information to verify, update, or correct it, and 
to have any obsolete information removed. If you created an account 
on one of our Web Site, you can access and change your online account profile yourself. 
You can also ask to review any of the information that we have retained, how we 
have used it, and to whom we have disclosed it at any time by contacting 
us as indicated below under the heading "Contacting Penny Auctions Canada". 
Subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law, and provided we can 
authenticate your identity, you will be given reasonable access to your 
personal information, and will be entitled to challenge the accuracy 
and completeness of the information and to have it amended as appropriate. 
You may also ask us to change your preferences regarding how we use 
or disclose your information, or let us know that you do not wish 
to receive any further communication from us.</p>

<h3>When is Your Information Removed?</h3>

<p>We keep your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business 
purposes and to meet any legal requirements. We have retention standards 
that meet these parameters. We destroy your information when it is no longer 
needed, or we remove your personally identifiable information to render it anonymous.</p>
