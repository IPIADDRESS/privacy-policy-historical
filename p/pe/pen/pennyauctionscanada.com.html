If you choose not to provide requested personal information, you will not be able to 
use certain features of the Web Site and you will not be able to engage in transactions

</p><h3>Information Penny Auctions Canada Collects Automatically </h3>

<p>Like many other Web Sites, Penny Auctions Canada automatically collects certain 
non-personal information regarding Web Site users that does not identify you.  
Examples include the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, 
the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the 
Web Site, the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to the Web Site, 
the operating system you are using, the sections of the Web Site you visit, 
the Web Site pages read and images viewed, and the content you download from the Web Site.  
This non-personal information is used for Web Site and system administration purposes and to improve the Web Site.</p>

<h3>Cookies </h3>

<p>Pennyauctionscanada.COM, the "Web Site", uses "cookies", a technology that 
installs a small amount of information on a Web Site user's computer to permit the 
Web Site to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience 
and use of the Web Site.  For example, the information provided through cookies is 
used to recognize you as a previous user of the Web Site (so you do not have to enter 
your billing information every time), to offer personalized Web page content and 
information for your use, to track your activity at the Web Site, to respond to your needs, 
and to otherwise facilitate and enhance your Web Site experience. You may choose to 
decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Web Site 
and your ability to access certain features of the Web Site or engage in transactions through the Web Site.</p>

<h3>Tracking Information </h3>

<p>We may use non-personal information, beacons or pixel tags to compile tracking information 
reports regarding Web Site user demographics, Web Site traffic patterns, and Web Site 
purchases, and then provide those reports to advertisers and others. None of the tracking 
information in the reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information 
of individual users. We may also link tracking information with personal information 
voluntarily provided by Web Site users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked 
information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only 
in accordance with this Policy.  </p>

<h3>Links to Other Web Sites </h3>

<p>Our Web Site may contain links to other Web sites or Internet resources. 
When you click on one of those links you are contacting another Web Site 
or internet resource. Penny Auctions Canada, and/or Pennyauctionscanada.COM 
has no responsibility or liability for or control over those other Web Sites 
or internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your personal 
information.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other sites 
to learn how they collect and use information about you.</p>

<h3>Supplementing information</h3>

<p>From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information 
from other sources, such as information validating your address or other 
available information you have provided us.  This is to help us maintain the 
accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide better service.</p>

<h3>Does Penny Auctions Canada Share Your Information?</h3>

<p>Penny Auctions Canada does not sell or rent our customers personal information 
to any other party. However, in the normal course of business we may share some 
of your personal information within our corporate family and with third parties 
acting on our behalf or as permitted or required by law.  Some of these operations 
may result in personal information collected by Penny Auctions Canada being stored 
or processed outside of Canada and, as a result, your personal information may be 
accessible to law enforcement and regulatory authorities in accordance with the law of these foreign jurisdictions.</p>

<h3>Disclosure to Service Providers </h3>

<p>Penny Auctions Canada may use third parties to manage one of more aspects 
of our business operations, including the processing or handing of personal information. 
When we do use an outside company, we use contractual or other appropriate means to 
ensure that your personal information is used in a manner that is consistent with 
this Privacy Policy.  For example, we may share personal information with 
third parties to perform services on our behalf such as: fulfilling online orders, 
processing non-cash payments, sending marketing communications, servicing products, 
conducting research surveys, verifying and validating information that you have 
provided to us, delivering products, and providing customer support services.  
Penny Auctions Canada has taken precautions to prevent the fraudulent use of 
your information on our Web Site.  Penny Auctions Canada has adopted industry 
standard authentication procedures to ensure your protection while shopping 
with us online. This includes, but is not limited to, contacting financial 
institutions or credit reporting agencies to ensure the authenticity of your 
credit card and to validate your credit card billing information.  
We will use reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal information is 
used in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you do not 
wish us to provide your personal information to those service providers, 
we may be unable to process your transaction.</p>

<h3>Legal Disclosure </h3>

<p>Penny Auctions Canada may disclose your information as permitted or required to by law; for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>to a government institution or other person or entity that has asserted its lawful authority to obtain the information; 
</li><li>where we have reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful in the investigation of unlawful activity; 
</li><li>to comply with a subpoena or warrant or an order made by a court, person or entity with jurisdiction to compel the production of information; 
</li><li>to comply with court rules regarding the production of records and information; and 
</li><li>to our legal counsel. 
</li></ul>

<h3>How does Penny Auctions Canada Protect My Information? </h3>

<p>The security of your personal information is a high priority for Penny Auctions Canada. 
We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security standards to protect your 
personal information, whether recorded on paper or captured electronically, against 
unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.  Although we cannot take responsibility 
for any theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction of data 
by a third party, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.  
For example, electronic records are stored in secure, limited-access servers; 
we employ technological tools like firewalls and passwords; 
and we ensure our employees are trained on the importance of maintaining the 
security and confidentiality of personal information.</p>

<h3>Choosing a Password</h3>

<p>When you create an online account on our Web Site, you need to select a personal password. 
To maximize your level of protection, you should choose at least 6 characters including 
a combination of both letters and numbers. You are solely responsible for maintaining 
the secrecy of your password and any account information. Penny Auctions Canada will 
never send an unsolicited communication asking you for your password or requesting that 
you update your account credentials. To learn more about Phishing and email fraud, please read below:

</p><h4>Learn about E-mail Fraud</h4>

<p>Phishing (also referred to as brand spoofing) is a type of scheme that uses 
fraudulent e-mail and web pages to gather personal, financial and sensitive 
information for the purpose of identity theft. Most commonly, users receive 
spam e-mail (mass e-mail messaging) and pop-up windows that appear to come from 
legitimate businesses. People have been tricked by these deceptive solicitations 
into sharing passwords and credit card, social security and bank account numbers.  
As an online user, you should always continue to take precautions including 
querying the origination of e-mails, the URLs that those e-mails purport to 
take you to, and paying close attention to the secure padlock icon on your Internet Browser.
