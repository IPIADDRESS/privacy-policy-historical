    <p class="st">What Personal Information Is Collected</p>
    <p>Depending on how you use our SItes, we may ask you to share personal information with us. <em>Whether you choose to give PGD information is completely up to you, but keep in mind that if you withhold information, you may not be able to use many of our services or Site(s). </em></p>
    <p>PGD will ask you for information, including some personal information, if you use one of several services:</p>

    <p class="st">Becoming a Registered User of www.penthouse.com.</p>
    <p>In order to become a registered user of <a href="http://www.penthouse.com">www.penthouse.com</a> or other Site(s), you will need to share some personal information, such as your name and e-mail address.

Once you register, you will have an account with PGD and a password to access that account. You may never use another person's account without permission and you may not use anyone else's password.

Any personally identifiable information retained by PGD is stored in a secure manner with limited administrative access.</p>
    <p>Despite all of our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions.

    <p class="st">How to Avoid Receiving Newsletters and Other PGD Materials</p>
    <p>We use e-mail addresses and mailing addresses to send out newsletters and other announcements with information about PGD's new products, offers and special features.

    <p class="st">Cookies, Pixel Tags and Tracking</p>
    <p>PGD wants to give you the best possible experience when you visit our websites. We like to constantly update and improve the features on our Site(s), we like to personalize your browsing and shopping experience and we like to recognize you when you return to www.penthouse.com. We have a variety of ways of doing this.</p>
    <p>We collect information about how you use our Site(s) by setting and accessing cookies on your computer. When you visit one of our Site(s), a cookie will be sent to your browser and then stored on your computer's hard drive. We use these cookies to track information about how often you visit our web site, what pages you view, and where you go after you leave the site. We also link the visitor ID from your cookie to a user ID in our database to help us analyze web traffic and statistics. Other companies help us with data research and analysis, but they are prohibited from using that data for any other purpose. Cookies also help us improve your shopping experience by, among other things, keeping track of your preferences, recognizing you if you are a registered user, and tracking your order as you use our sites If any of your personal information needs to be accessed during that process, you will have to log in or otherwise authenticate yourself.</p>
    <p>We use pixel tags (also called web beacons or "clear" gifs) on our Site(s). They help us analyze what our clients like to do on our Site(s) and the effectiveness of our features and advertising. They can also help us customize your browsing and shopping experience. We may use information collected through pixel tags or tracked links in combination with your personally identifiable information. We may also combine personally identifiable information you provide to PGD with other personal information (such as purchase history and demographic information). We often work with other companies to help us track, collect and analyze this information but they are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose.</p>

    <p>PGD also works with advertising partners (like Google and DoubleClick) that use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to serve advertisements on behalf of their retail clients, including PGD, across the Internet, including to you after you have visited our Site(s). These advertising partners engage in remarketing, online behavioral advertising and ad delivery and reporting. With respect to PGD, these advertising partners may collect anonymous information about your browser as it makes visits to websites across the Internet (including our Site(s)) and your interaction with our advertising and e-mail communications. This anonymous information may also be used to tailor advertising for you and others elsewhere on the Internet. PGD will have access to the information collected by these advertising partners and can then use it in combination with personally identifiable information provided by you to PGD to enhance your experience on our Site(s). We will not share that personally identifiable information with these advertising partners.</p>

    <p class="st">No Use for any person under 18</p>
    <p>Persons under 18 are not permitted to use the Site(s). We do not knowingly collect information from persons under the age of 18. By using the Site(s), you represent that you are at least 18 years old and also understand that you must be at least 18 years old in order to create any type of account.</p>

    <p class="st">Social Commerce and Other Third Parties</p>
    <p>We work with trusted third parties, including social network sites like Facebook, and with application developers who specialize in social commerce so we can connect to your social networks. Other social networks we use include Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Vine, Pinterest and Google+. All of these companies operate "Third Party Site(s)". We provide access to our Site(s) by third parties and business partners so we can generate interest in our products among members of your social networks and to allow you to share product interests with friends in your network.</p>
    <p>The use of any features made available to you on our Site(s) by a third party may result in information being collected or shared about you by us or by the third party. Information collected or shared through any such third party features is considered "public information" by us because the Third Party Site(s) made it publicly available. If you do not want us to be able to access information about you from Third Party Site(s), you must instruct Third Party Site(s) not to share the information. We cannot control how your data is collected, stored, used or shared by Third Party Site(s) or to whom it is disclosed. Please be sure to review the privacy policies and privacy settings on your social networking sites to make sure you understand the information they are sharing. If you do not want a Third Party Site(s) to share information about you, you must contact that site and determine whether it gives you the opportunity to opt out of sharing such information. PGD is not responsible for how these third parties may use information collected from or about you. However, we do identify any areas on our Site(s) where third parties share information about you.</p>

    <p class="st">Web Beacons</p>
    <p>PGD may allow certain partners to include web beacons within pages on the Site(s). PGD may also share portions of our log file data, including IP address, with these partners for analytics purposes. In the event your IP address is shared, this information may be used to estimate general location and other technographics (such as connection speed, whether you have visited the Site(s) in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit the Site(s)). These partners aggregate information about our advertising and what you see on the Site(s) and then provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers.</p>
