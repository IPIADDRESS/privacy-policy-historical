When you request information, a catalog, or literature, enroll in a course or
program, or purchase a product from Professional Publications, our
order-processing software creates a permanent, historical record containing
information ("Personal Information") about you. The software gives you a unique
identification number which helps us to track all of your transactions. When you
buy a Professional Publications product, we may ask you to return a registration
card that comes with the product. If you install software or enroll in an online
course, we may ask you to register electronically. When you do, we may merge your
registration information with any other information you've already left with us.
If you ever want to review or update that information, please contact
Professional Publications's <a href="mailto:marketing@ppi2pass.com">Marketing
Department.</a> If you haven't already given us
your e-mail address, we will ask you to do so. This ensures that only you can
access your information.
</p><p>
Professional Publications occasionally shares Personal Information with an
affiliated company, the Professional Engineering Institute, which uses the
Personal Information to  offer you live (classroom) engineering examination
preparation classes. All solicitations are by email and postal service only. No
other company has access to your Personal Information. Personal Information is
never sold or given to any other company.
</p><p>
<b>Consent:</b> If you choose not to provide Personal Information, you can still use
most of this website. However, you will not be able to enter a complete order,
obtain some services, or access some areas.
</p><p>
<b>Access:</b> We will help you keep your Personal Information correct and current. You
need only contact us and request changes to your Personal Information.
</p><p>
<b>Security:</b> Professional Publications takes reasonable steps to protect your
Personal Information and honor your choices for its intended use. We have
policies and procedures to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized
access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
</p><p>
<b>Enforcement:</b> If for some reason you believe Professional Publications has not
adhered to the principles described herein, please notify us by 
<a href="mailto:marketing@ppi2pass.com">email</a>, and we will do our best to determine and correct any
problem promptly.
</p><p>

<b>Cookies:</b> In some cases, part of your Personal Information may be sent back to and stored
on your computer in the form of a cookie. The cookie contains code that is
uniquely yours. The stored information (i.e., the cookie) enables seamless travel
across ppi2pass.com and its related sites, allowing you to download free
