This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout Affiliate Classroom governing Affiliate Classroom's use of personally identifiable information provided to Affiliate Classroom via this Site.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Privacy Policy Updates</strong></p>
            <p align="left">Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Affiliate Classroom may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Affiliate Classroom will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at www.affiliateclassroom.com so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information. Affiliate Classroom encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this Site will be subject to the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
            <p align="left">You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain sections of this Site, to use certain services, we may require you to register for an account, or we may invite you to submit questions or comments or request information, participate in surveys, questionnaires or contests, subscribe to newsletters or participate in community forums. Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may ask that you complete and submit an online form with personally identifiable information such as your name, username, email address, contact information and credit card information. </p>
            <p align="left">We may use your personally identifiable information to deliver certain services, products or information you have requested, verify your authority to enter certain password protected areas of the Site, send you notices for products and/or services that you have used or that may be of interest to you, and improve the content and general administration of the Site. </p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Disclosure</strong></p>
