	<li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary (a) to protect our rights, the integrity of the Online Services, or your safety or the safety of others, or (b) to detect, prevent, or respond to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Use, violations of law, or other misuse of the Online Services; and</li>

<p>Information Automatically Collected From You&nbsp;– We and our service providers may automatically collect certain technical information from your computer or mobile device over time and across different websites when you use the Online Services, such as your Internet Protocol address, your geographic location, your browser type, your operating system, the pages you view on the Online Services, the pages you view immediately before and after you access the Online Services, and the search terms you enter on the Online Services. This information allows us and our service providers to recognize you and personalize your experience if you return to the Online Services, to improve the Online Services and the services we provide, and to provide you with Targeted Advertisements. We and our service providers may collect this information using “cookies,” which are small text files that many websites save on your computer when you visit and access when you return, or similar technologies. We also collect this information by setting a unique&nbsp;anonymous&nbsp;identifier called User ID, set by&nbsp;Universal Google Analytics. User ID helps identify&nbsp;unique&nbsp;users across multiple devices and browsers.&nbsp;Clearing your cookies does not ensure that you will not be recognized as the same unique visitor even after you cleared them. Website visitors who do not want their data collected with Google Analytics in this way can install the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881" target="_blank">Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.</a></p>

<h3>Online advertisements</h3>

<p>Our third-party advertising partners may use cookies and similar technologies on the Online Services and on third-party websites on which our ads appear, which allow the advertising partners to track certain information about user behavior, such as "click-stream data." The information practices of these advertising partners are governed by their own privacy policies and are not governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Where is this information processed?</h3>

<p>Information collected through the Online Services will be processed in and subject to the laws of the United States. In addition, we may transfer your information outside the United States to our affiliates and service providers located in other countries. By using the Online Services, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the United States and these other countries.</p>

<h3>How is your information secured?</h3>

<p>We strive to maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to safeguard the information collected through the Online Services. However, no information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to the Online Services over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks. If you have concerns about the security of sensitive information, do not send it electronically.</p>

If you reject or block cookies from the Online Services, however, the Online Services may not function as intended.</p>

<p>In addition to the records left on your computer by cookies, your browser and operating system contain other records of your web browsing and other actions (e.g., browser history). As with cookies, you can find information about how to clear these history trails in your browser’s "Help" menu.</p>

<p>We do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. For more information about do not track, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.org/" target="_blank">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.</p>
