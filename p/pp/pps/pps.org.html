					<h4>General Policy</h4>
					<p>PPS is a non-profit organization. As such, refunds will generally not be provided. However, PPS may consider refunds on a case-by-case basis. To request a refund, contact PPS at (212) 620-5660.</p>

					<h4>Publications</h4>
					<p>PPS makes every effort to ensure that customers receive the product they have ordered. In cases where customers receive incorrect or damaged books, PPS will remedy the situation promptly and professionally. </p><br>
					<p>PPS is only under obligation to accept returns and refund in cases where customers receive a product:</p><br>
					<ol>
					  <li>in damaged condition;</li>
					  <li>that they didn’t order; or</li>
					  <li>that is not what they were led to expect (e.g. the product does not match a description or sample they were given).</li>
				  </ol><br>
                    <p>In these cases, PPS will refund the price in full and will reimburse the customer for any reasonable charges involved with the return of the product. If the customer prefers, we may provide credit or arrange a suitable exchange in place of a refund. </p><br>
                    <p>ALL refunds are dependent on the return of the product to PPS in the same/similar packaging as it was delivered, and in saleable condition (except in cases where a damaged product was delivered). </p><br>
                    <p>PPS will NOT send products to customers, on consignment (as sample items), to be purchased at their discretion. </p><br>
                    <p>PPS will not refund, credit or exchange products if the customer has received the goods they ordered and simply changes his/her mind. PPS values our customers; however, as a non-profit organization, lacks the resources (staff and financial) to refund orders filled properly. </p><br>
                    <p>If customers insist, they are invited to state the matter in writing and send it to:</p><br>
                    <blockquote> Marcos Martinez<br>
                      Project for Public Spaces<br>
                      700 Broadway, 4th Fl<br>
                      New York, NY 10003</blockquote><br>
                    <p>In certain cases, PPS will accept returns from customers who, acting in good faith, have received a book that was ‘not what they were after.’ This decision is to be made at the discretion of the Operations Director and/or Finance Officer on condition that:</p><br>
                    <ol>
                      <li>PPS will NOT reimburse the customer for the delivery cost of returning the book;</li>
                      <li>refund will only be given if the book is returned in the same/similar packaging and in saleable condition; and</li>
                      <li>the refund will be paid less the postage and handling costs associated with the original order and less an administrative fee for processing the return of the goods.</li>
                    </ol><br>
                  <p>PPS will NOT refund customers who simply return books without an adequate reason. If customers are ineligible for refund, we will inform them that they must incur the cost of resending the products. </p><br>
                    <p> If customers are not satisfied with the returns/refunds process, they may contact: </p>
    <p>Phone: (212) 620- 5660<br>
                      Email: info@pps.org</p>
