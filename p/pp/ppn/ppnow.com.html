            <p>ppnow.com takes your privacy seriously. We will not sell, lease or 
              exchange your personal data to third parties in ways other than 
              described in this privacy policy. This Privacy Policy is a part 
              of the ppnow.com Terms of Service policy. By using ppnow.comluding services 
              available at the ppnow.com domains, users are using a service provided 
              by ppnow.com. and they agree to be bound by the Terms of Service and 
              this Privacy Policy. Some terms may be defined in the Terms of Service. 
              This Privacy Policy only addresses activities from our servers.</p>
            <p>1. Information Collection &amp; Use<br>
              Registration</p>
            <p>The ppnow.com service requires a login in order to provide you with 
              a personalized account. During our account registration process, 
              we will collect a login name, password, and an email address from 
              you. You must provide all of this information in order to obtain 
              an account. After completing our registration form, you will receive 
              a welcome email describing your new ppnow.com account, and how to 
              access that account.<br>
              Account Subscriptions</p>
            <p>ppnow.com provides a number of tools that will allow you to promote 
              your web site over email. Email addresses entered into these forms 
              are not stored in our database, but may be stored in our system 
              logs in text format to assist us in tracking down abusive users 
              (users flooding the system), or using these tools for spamming. 
              We will never contact addresses logged in this manner.<br>
              Hosted Web Sites</p>
            <p>Users hosting web sites with ppnow.com are given tools that may ask 
              you to optionally enter your email address when making comments 
              on their web site, or contacting them through their web site. Since 
              users on ppnow.com can manipulate the HTML code on their site directly, 
              there are opportunities available for a malicious user to inject 
              code that would log your information before it reaches our system. 
              In addition, once in our system, web site owners will have the opportunity 
              to review and modify any information entered into their web site. 
              Since we do not have full control over how members run their individual 
              sites, this privacy policy does not apply to any hosted ppnow.com 
              web site that you do not own. You should check that you trust the 
              owner of a particular web site before submitting personally identifiable 
              information on that site.<br>
              Server Logs</p>
            <p>When accessing web pages on the ppnow.com domain, ppnow.com may log 
              your IP address, access URL, time of access, browser type, and referral 
              URL in order to provide us with internal information regarding site 
              traffic statistics. This information may also be used to identify 
              users who are using the service for spam or other activity that 
              is deemed in conflict with our Terms of Service. This information 
              is used in the aggregate, and is never linked back to any personally 
              identifiable information.</p>
            <p>2. Uses of Information</p>
            <p>ppnow.com collects the aforementioned personally identifiable information 
              in order to provide you with a service that allows you to maintain 
              an online presence. Various features in our Web site management 
              system will, at your discretion, display your name, or adjust the 
              date and time of events based on your locale. The ppnow.com Website 
              Manager interface will always give you an option before any piece 
              of your personally identifiable information is presented on your 
              web site, and situations where information will be published is 
              made clear in various spots in the interface (for example, your 
              name is tied to welcome emails you send out from our system, and 
              notice of this is given to you within the interface for that tool).</p>
            <p>ppnow.com also uses information collected through its service to 
              send out notifications regarding service related issues (such as 
              maintenance periods, billing problems, account expirations, and 
              other items that may impact service). We do not send contact information 
              unless the matter is deemed urgent, and most communication will 
              occur through your ppnow.com Website Manager interface.</p>
            <p>Information collected through our service logs is used only to 
              identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information 
              regarding web site traffic. This statistical information is not 
              aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user 
              of the system.</p>
            <p>ppnow.com. is the sole owner of information collected on http://www.ppnow.com/. 
              Your information is never shared, leased or given to any third parties 
              in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.</p>
            <p>3. Information Security</p>
            <p>We store all user information in secure databases protected via 
              a variety of industry-standard access controls. Secure passwords, 
              SSL encryption, disk-based encryption, firewalls, and other measures 
              are in place that help us protect your data. This data is accessed 
              only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, please 
              feel free email us.</p>
            <p>4. Access to Personally Identifiable Information<br>
              Changing Information</p>
            <p>All information that ppnow.com stores related to your accountluding 
              any subscription billing information, is accessible through your 
              ppnow.com Website Manager interface. You may use this interface to 
              adjust your information at any time, and we encourage you to keep 
              this information up to date so that your customer service requests 
              and billing processes operate efficiently.<br>
              Removing Information</p>
            <p>To remove your personally identifiable information from our system, 
              submit your account for deactivation. Your personal information 
              will be removed immediately, though your actual login name will 
              remain reserved on our system until re-collection. If you wish to 
              only remove your billing subscription information, cancel your paid 
              account. Both of these removals can be accessed through your ppnow.com 
              Website Manager interface.</p>
            <p>5. Communications from ppnow.com.<br>
              Service-related Announcements</p>
            <p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare 
              occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service 
              is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. 
              Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are 
              not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you 
              have the option to deactivate your account.<br>
              Customer Service</p>
            <p>Upon issuing a customer support request to ppnow.com, we may use 
              your information and email address to contact you regarding your 
              inquiry.</p>
            <p>6. Information Sharing and Disclosure<br>
              Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</p>
            <p>We share aggregated demographic information about our user base 
              with our advertisers. This information does not identify individual 
              users. This information contains statistics related to traffic and 
              the geographic location of our customers.</p>
            <p>We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable 
              information.</p>
            <p>7. Agents<br>
              Credit Card Processing</p>
            <p>We will submit your billing information to our credit card processing 
              agent for approval when you update your billing information, or 
              place an order on our web site. This company does not retain, share, 
              store or use personally identifiable information for any purpose 
              other than billing.</p>
            <p>8. Choice/Opt-out</p>
            <p>Only non-promotional service announcements, as described in the 
              above section, will be issued without prior authorization.</p>
            <p>Upon deactivating your ppnow.com account, you will receive no further 
              communication from us (service announcements included).</p>
            <p>9. Log Files</p>
            <p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically 
              and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol 
              (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit 
              pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
            <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, 
              to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements 
              around the site and to gather demographic information about our 
              user base as a whole.</p>
            <p>We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally 
              identifiable information.</p>
            <p>10. Cookies</p>
            <p>Like most web sites, we use small bits of data called cookies stored 
              on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies 
              let us 'remember' information about your preferences and passwords 
              and allow you to move within our Service without reintroducing yourself. 
              Members who disable cookies will not be able to use ppnow.com's services, 
              as they are required to maintain your login to our service within 
              a browser session. Disabling cookies does not prevent you from accessing 
              web sites published under our system, though some features of those 
              sites may be degraded.</p>
            <p>These cookies can be tied back to personally identifiable information 
              only in the event that you are logged in to our service. If you 
              are logged in to our service, the cookies on your computer will 
              uniquely identify your account within our system.</p>
            <p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by ppnow.com. only 
              and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. See the 
              'Third Party Advertisers' section for more details.</p>

            <p>If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, or on any 
              ppnow.com member web site, you should be aware that any personally 
              identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, 
              or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send 
              you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally 
              identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
            <p>Certain information, such as your name and ip address are logged 
              by our system when posting messages, and are made available to the 
              owner of the web site you are posting on. These items may be displayed 
              to readers of the site you are posting on, depending on the settings 
              of that particular site. If you would not like to have these details 
              disclosed, refrain from posting messages to any ppnow.com bulletin 
              board or chat room.</p>

              or controlled by ppnow.com. Please be aware that we, ppnow.com., are

              personally identifiable information.</p>

              this Web site.</p>
            <p>14. Business Transitions</p>
            <p>In the event ppnow.com. goes through a business transition, such 
              as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a 
              portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information 
              will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified 
              via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal 
              information.</p>
            <p>15. Legal Disclaimer</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information 
              as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary

              court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
            <p><br>
              16. Changes in this Privacy Statement</p>
            <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes

              appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, 
              how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose 
              it.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, 
              so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this 
              policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice
