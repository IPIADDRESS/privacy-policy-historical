         <h2>Pikimal Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
    Last updated August 9th, 2010
</p>
<p>
    Pikimal Inc. operates the web site hosted at www.Pikimal.com (the "Site") and related services (the "Services") to offer an open repository of data shared by the world, made easy for anyone to mix, mash, and re-use. Pikimal values the privacy of the users, subscribers, publishers, members, and others who visit the Site or Services (collectively or individually, "Users"). By using the Site or Services, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this notice. This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the Pikimal Terms of Service. Your use of the Site and Services and any personal information you provide through the Site and Services are subject at all time to this Privacy Notice and the <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.
</p>
<h2>The Information Pikimal Collects</h2>
<p>
    In order to use the Site or Services, users must register with the site and in the process we may collect certain user-provided, personally identifiable information including name and email address. Our server logs automatically collect information, such as your IP address, pages you access, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your visit, which helps us track users' movements around our site and understand trends.
</p>
<p>
    We may assign your computer one or more cookies which may collect information to facilitate access to our website and to personalize your online experience. We may use standard Internet tools, such web beacons, which collect information that tracks your use of our website and enables us to customize our services and advertisements.
</p>
<p>
    We allow registered users to send invitations to their friends. We use your friends' email addresses to send them these invitations, and we retain their addresses for the purpose of identifying them when they come to our site. Unless they register with the site, we do not send them any other emails or use their email address for any other purpose.
</p>
<h2>The Way Pikimal Uses Information</h2>
<p>
    Pikimal uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Site and Services as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
</p>
<p>
    We will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Site and Services updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the Site or Services.
</p>
<p>
    Pikimal uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Site or Services works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2>When Pikimal Discloses Information</h2>
<p>
    Pikimal does not share your information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any information that you voluntarily choose to display on the Site or Services such as when you publish attribution credits for documents or profile information becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.
</p>
<p>
    We may disclose aggregate information about our users to researchers, product developers, other organizations, or publicly. This information will not personally identify you, but it may be possible to use this information in combination with your site activity to identify how your user has utilized the site.
</p>
<p>
    We may disclose User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis; create industry reports for research and/or profit; assist in product feature development; offer certain functionality; and assist Pikimal in improving the Site or Services and creating new services features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Notice, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.
</p>
<p>
    Pikimal may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.
</p>
<p>
    Pikimal also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary: to take precautions against liability; to protect Pikimal from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Site and Services; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Pikimal, our Users, or others.
</p>
<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<p>
    You may, of course, decline to share your personally identifiable information with Pikimal, in which case Pikimal will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Site or Services. You may update or correct your user information and preferences at any time by contacting us.
</p>
<p>
    You may delete your account in its entirety at any point; however, any information we have previously collected from you will not be deleted.
</p>
<p>
    To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.
</p>
<p>
    Any personal information that you disclose on public areas of the site (item discussions, message boards, profile descriptions, blog comments, etc.) becomes publicly available and could be collected and used by anyone on the Internet. We recommend that you do not provide any sensitive or personally identifiable information when contributing to such public content.
</p>
<h2>Third Party Affiliates</h2>
<p>
    Information shared through Facebook Connect is subject to the same privacy agreement as other user information collected through pikimal.com. By agreeing to the "Request for Permission" through Facebook Connect, you grant us permission to access your private profile information, including, but not limited to: email address, name, birthday, status updates, photos, notes, "likes", and education/work history. This data cannot and will not be collected unless you voluntarily choose to allow pikimal.com access.
</p>
<p>
    In the future we may have third-party sites (retail or otherwise) affiliated with pikimal.com. All transactions through these sites are subject to their privacy agreements.
</p>
<p>
    In the future there may also be third-party sites who use our API. These third parties may have access to your data (which may include personal information) via our API and webservices or arrangements with our business partners. These people may use this information for their own purposes, which may be either commercial or non-commercial in nature.
</p>
<p>
    We also use third party advertisements to support our site.  Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.  This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
</p>
<p>
    You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in your internet security software.  However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites and could include the inability to login to accounts, services or programs.
