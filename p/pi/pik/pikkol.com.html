    <p>INFORMATION, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>

    <p>Please review the following carefully so that you understand our privacy practices. If

      you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, do not use any of our Services or give us any

      of your information. In addition, please review our&nbsp;Terms and Conditions, which may

      apply to your use of our websites and mobile applications. This Privacy Policy is

      incorporated by reference into the applicable Terms and Conditions.</p>

      at&nbsp;contact@pikkol.com</p>

    <p class="subhead">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? <br>

      (a) INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US </p>

      Information”). We may collect this information through various forms and in various

      places through the Services, including account registration forms, contact us forms,

      or when you otherwise interact with us. When you sign up to use the Services, you

      create a user profile. To request for our services, apart from your Personal

      Information, you also provide us details of origin of shipping, destination of shipping,

      location addresses, list or photos of items to be shipped. The current data fields that

      might be requested for are:<br>

      Type of apartment<br></p>


    <p>Apart from these you may also provide ratings and review for the Vendors engaged

      by you. This information is not categorized under Personal information. This will be

      published on the Site for other customers to view and take a decision on the Vendor.

      To give credibility to the rating, a user will be able to request to see your contact

      details while he/she is considering the particular vendor for their requirement. Your

      contact details will only be revealed with your permission.<br></p>

    <p class="subhead">(b) INFORMATION WE COLLECT AS YOU ACCESS AND USE OUR

      SERVICES</p>

    <p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to

      submit to us, we and our third-party service providers (“TPSP”s) may use a variety of

      technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever

      you visit or interact with the Services (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information

      may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our

      Services, all of the areas within our Services that you visit, and the time of day,

      among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purpose,

      including to enhance or otherwise improve the Services. In addition, we collect your

      IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer, mobile or

      other device used to access the Services (any, a “Device”). A Device Identifier is a

      number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Services,

      and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Usage Information

      may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate

      Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat

      it as Personal Information.</p>

    purposes – including determining origin or destination, or the charge for the

    transportation you requested via our Services, to provide you with customer support,

    to send you promotions and offers, to enhance our Services, and for our internal

    business purposes.<br>

    browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. Cookies can be disabled or

    controlled by setting a preference within your web browser or on your Device. If you

    Services may not function properly or may not be able to customize the delivery of

    information to you.<br>

    resulting information) by third-parties, and use of third party cookies is not covered by

    our Privacy Policy.<br>

    <p class="subhead">(c) INFORMATION THIRD PARTIES PROVIDE ABOUT YOU</p>

    <p>We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you through

      our web site or Mobile Application with outside records from third parties in order to

      enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you

      opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to

      you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with

      information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy

      Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.</p>

    <p class="subhead">(D) INFORMATION COLLECTED BY MOBILE APPLICATIONS</p>

    <p> Our Services are primarily provided through an application on your mobile, tablet

      computer or similar device (“Mobile Application”). You agree that we may collect and

      use technical data and related information, including but not limited to, technical

      information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that

      is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product

      support and other services to you (if any) related to such Mobile Applications.

      When you use any of our Mobile Applications, the Mobile Application may

      automatically collect and store some or all of the following information from your

      mobile device (“Mobile Device Information”), including without limitation:</p>

    you spend using the Mobile Application, how often you use the Mobile Application,

    actions you take in the Mobile Application and how you engage with the Mobile

    Application<br>

    Information to allow us to personalize the services and content available through the

    Mobile Application<br>

    We may use information automatically collected by the Mobile Application (including

    the Mobile Device Information) in the following ways:<br>

    To operate and improve our Mobile Applications, other Services, our company’s

    services, and tools<br>

    Application features are most popular and useful to users, and for other statistical

    analyses;<br>

    applicable terms of service or terms of use for the Mobile Application, and to

    investigate fraud, chargeback or other matters;<br>

    communications sent to you through the Mobile Application.<br>

    With respect to geo-location data we track through your Mobile Device, we use that

    geo-location information for various purposes – including for you to be able to vselect

    the origin or destination easily. Except as otherwise permitted in this Privacy Policy,

    we will not share this information with third parties for any purpose and will only use

    this information for the sole purpose of providing you with the ability to request

    services via Pikkol’s Mobile Application. You may at any time no longer allow our

    Mobile Application to use your location by turning this feature off at the Mobile Device

    level.<br>

    We also provide some of your Personal Information (such as your name , origin and

    destination addresses, contact number, item details) to the Vendor whose quote you

    have selected. The selected Vendor may share that information with its employees,

    partners or agents (that are providing the shipping/relocation service) and will also be

    able to access your Personal Information, including your geo-location data.

    We may associate your unique mobile Device Identifier or Mobile Application usage

    information with any Personal Information you provide, but we will treat the combined

    information as Personal Information.<br>

    Personal Information may also be collected and shared with third-parties if there is

    content from the Mobile Application that you specifically and knowingly upload to,

    share with or transmit to an email recipient, online community, website, or to the

    public, e.g. uploaded photos, posted reviews or comments, or information about you

    or the service that you choose to share with others through features which may be

    provided on our Services. This uploaded, shared or transmitted content will also be

    subject to the privacy policy of the email, online community website, social media or

    other platform to which you upload, share or transmit the content.<br>

    <p class="subhead">2. USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</p>
    Our primary goal in collecting your Personal information or Usage Information is to
    provide you with an enhanced experience when using the Services.<br>

    Based upon the Personal Information you provide us when registering for an

    account, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your username and

    password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to

    provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate

    with you by email, telephone, or SMS or text message, in accordance with your

    wishes.<br>

    We use your information to closely monitor which features of the Services are used

    most, to allow you to view your order history, view any promotions we may currently

    be running, and to determine which features we need to focus on improving,

    including usage patterns and geographic locations to determine where we should

    offer or focus services, features and/or resources.<br>

    We use the information collected from our Mobile Application so that we are able to

    serve you the correct app version depending on your device type, for troubleshooting

    and in some cases, marketing purposes.<br>

    We use your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our

    computer server, and to administer our web site(s). Your IP address is used to help

    identify you, but contains no personal information about you.<br>

    We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is

    necessary to do so. For instance, if our Services are temporarily suspended for

    maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these

    communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive

    them, you have the option to deactivate your account.<br>

    In addition, we may use your Personal Information or Usage Information that we

    collect about you: (1) to provide you with information or services or process

    transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive including to send you

    business purposes; (7) for inclusion in our data analytics; and (8) for purposes

    disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this

    Privacy Policy.<br>

    similar function may not receive a response.<br>

    <p class="subhead">3. HOW AND WHEN DO WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD

      PARTIES?</p>

    We may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user

    statistics and log data, with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling,

    to deliver targeted advertising about other products or services, or for other business

    purposes. We do not sell, share, rent or trade the information we have collected

    about you, including Personal Information, other than as disclosed within this Privacy

  <div class="col-xs-12 faq">
    <p class="faqQuestions"> What is Pikkol?</p>

    <p>Pikkol is a technology-centric firm that helps customers choose the right mover for all their needs. Be it a few items or an entire house, Pikkol is the one-stop moving destination for all.</p>

    <p class="faqQuestions">How can a customer plan a move with Pikkol?</p>

    <p>A customer can easily book a move with Pikkol. A booking can be completed in 3 simple steps</p>

    <p>1) Enter the move details: The customer can provide details about their date of shifting, type of house and item inventory. Through our App they can upload photos and create the list, making a house inspection unnecessary.</p>

    <p>2) Review quotes: An enquiry is sent to all approved packers and movers who are capable of providing the service level selected by the customer. The customer will receive quotes from multiple vendors.</p>

    <p>3) Book &amp; move: The customer can choose a packer and mover based on the reviews and ratings from various customers. On Pikkol, only verified customers who have availed the service are allowed to give ratings. Several spurious reviews exist on other platforms, making it very difficult to identify the right packer and mover.</p>


    <p class="faqQuestions">How is it that Pikkol is able to give better rates and services to customers than what packers and movers give directly?</p>

    <p>It is true that in most cases a customer would get the best rates for a particular service standard though Pikkol.</p>

    <p>Some of the reasons why packers and movers give better rates to Pikkol customers are</p>

    <p>1) Reduction in marketing expenses for packers and movers: Packers and movers spend money on yellow pages and just dialing websites that pass on leads to them.  They also send their executives for house inspection before an order is finalized.  Statistics show that one in seven such inspections leads to a conversion. Through Pikkol, since movers get involved after a lead is converted, their marketing expenses come down. They pass on the benefits that they gain through Pikkol to the customers.</p>

    <p>2) Volume of orders from Pikkol to packers and movers:  Pikkol gives several confirmed orders to the approved packers and movers. Since they are sure of the volume of orders that they would get from Pikkol, they tend to give the best rates to our customers. Since vendors run the risk of getting blacklisted from the platform, they tend to give the best service for the price quoted. In short, a Pikkol customer is treated as a corporate customer and hence gets the best rates and service.

    </p><p>3) Operational Improvements at packers and movers: Pikkol actively works with Packers and movers to improve their internal efficiencies and service standards. Route mapping and efficient scheduling of orders secured through Pikkol also helps them reap operational efficiencies.

    </p><p class="faqQuestions">Why book packers and movers through Pikkol?

    </p><p>Pikkol helps customers ship an item or shift their house very conveniently.

    </p><p>We have brought on board trusted packers and movers whom we count on to give our customers an exceptional experience. Pikkol evaluates the level of service that can be provided by a packer &amp; mover before allowing them to submit quotes to customers. We also ensure that they provide quotes only for the service level they are approved for.  Pikkol also does periodic evaluation that includes interaction with the crew, on-site inspection of packing expertise, offices and their organizational setup.

    </p><p>Apart from these there are several advantages that customers get in service quality, price and adherence to commitment that comes with Pikkol. We understand that for a customer there are a lot of things to work on during the time of a move.  So, we ensure that once a customer books his/her move on Pikkol, the process is completely hassle-free.

    </p><p class="faqQuestions">Why can’t Pikkol just generate instant quotes based on the requirements submitted by the customer?

    </p><p>We do not generate instant quotes but ensure that our customers get real quotes from real vendors.

    </p><p>The quotes from vendors for the same items, same type of house and same distance may vary based on a lot of parameters that cannot be programmatically managed. These could be the number of orders they have in that particular area on that day, their general workload on that day, availability of trucks and labour and even their interest in servicing the particular order.

    </p><p>For example, a packer and mover who has booked a move in Whitefield, might accept the next order in that area at a lower price than he normally provides. Similarly, if he doesn't have a team scheduled to be in Whitefield on a particular day, his quotes for a move in the area would be higher than normal. Similarly, if a packer and mover has a truck already scheduled to leave for Kolkata in which a part of the load could be accommodated, his quotes for a move to Kolkata will be lower for that day.

    </p><p>We ensure that our vendors are also as committed to the customer’s requirements as we are.

    </p><p class="faqQuestions">Where can we get tips and general guidelines on planning a move?

    </p><p>We constantly update tips and general guidelines on our blog. You can access the blog at www.pikkol.com/blog
