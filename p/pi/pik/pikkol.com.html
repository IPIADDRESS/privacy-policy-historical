    <p>Rednile Innovations Private Limited (the”Company”, “we”, “us”, or “Pikkol”) is

    <p>The Privacy Policy covers both our “online” (e.g., web and mobile services, including

      Services and post or incorporate this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p class="subhead">BY USING OUR SERVICES OR BY OTHERWISE GIVING US YOUR</p>

    <p>INFORMATION, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>

    <p>Please review the following carefully so that you understand our privacy practices. If

      you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, do not use any of our Services or give us any

      of your information. In addition, please review our&nbsp;Terms and Conditions, which may

      apply to your use of our websites and mobile applications. This Privacy Policy is

      incorporated by reference into the applicable Terms and Conditions.</p>

    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us

      at&nbsp;contact@pikkol.com</p>

    <p class="subhead">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? <br>

      (a) INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US </p>

    <p>We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as

      personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify

      you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, and mobile number (“Personal

      Information”). We may collect this information through various forms and in various

      places through the Services, including account registration forms, contact us forms,

      or when you otherwise interact with us. When you sign up to use the Services, you

      create a user profile. To request for our services, apart from your Personal

      Information, you also provide us details of origin of shipping, destination of shipping,

      location addresses, list or photos of items to be shipped. The current data fields that

      might be requested for are:<br>

      Mobile phone Number<br>

      Pin Code<br>

      List or photos of items<br>

      Type of apartment<br></p>


    <p>Apart from these you may also provide ratings and review for the Vendors engaged

      by you. This information is not categorized under Personal information. This will be

      published on the Site for other customers to view and take a decision on the Vendor.

      To give credibility to the rating, a user will be able to request to see your contact

      details while he/she is considering the particular vendor for their requirement. Your

      contact details will only be revealed with your permission.<br></p>

    <p class="subhead">(b) INFORMATION WE COLLECT AS YOU ACCESS AND USE OUR

      SERVICES</p>

    <p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to

      submit to us, we and our third-party service providers (“TPSP”s) may use a variety of

      technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever

      you visit or interact with the Services (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information

      may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our

      Services, all of the areas within our Services that you visit, and the time of day,

      among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purpose,

      including to enhance or otherwise improve the Services. In addition, we collect your

      IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer, mobile or

      other device used to access the Services (any, a “Device”). A Device Identifier is a

      number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Services,

      and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Usage Information

      may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate

      Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat

      it as Personal Information.</p>

    In case of booking via call centre, Pikkol will record the calls for quality and training

    purposes.<br>

    In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate through our Services,

    including, but not limited to geographic areas. Most GPS enabled mobile devices can

    define one’s location to within 50 feet. We collect this information for various

    purposes – including determining origin or destination, or the charge for the

    transportation you requested via our Services, to provide you with customer support,

    to send you promotions and offers, to enhance our Services, and for our internal

    business purposes.<br>

    Usage Information may be collected using a cookie.<br>

    If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, your

    browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. Cookies can be disabled or

    controlled by setting a preference within your web browser or on your Device. If you

    choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the

    Services may not function properly or may not be able to customize the delivery of

    information to you.<br>

    You should be aware that the Company cannot control the use of cookies (or the

    resulting information) by third-parties, and use of third party cookies is not covered by

    our Privacy Policy.<br>

    <p class="subhead">(c) INFORMATION THIRD PARTIES PROVIDE ABOUT YOU</p>

    <p>We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you through

      our web site or Mobile Application with outside records from third parties in order to

      enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you

      opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to

      you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with

      information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy

      Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.</p>

    <p class="subhead">(D) INFORMATION COLLECTED BY MOBILE APPLICATIONS</p>

    <p> Our Services are primarily provided through an application on your mobile, tablet

      computer or similar device (“Mobile Application”). You agree that we may collect and

      use technical data and related information, including but not limited to, technical

      information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that

      is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product

      support and other services to you (if any) related to such Mobile Applications.

      When you use any of our Mobile Applications, the Mobile Application may

      automatically collect and store some or all of the following information from your

      mobile device (“Mobile Device Information”), including without limitation:</p>
    Your preferred language and country site (if applicable)<br>

    – such as the International Mobile Equipment Identity or the Mobile Equipment ID

    number<br>

    The manufacturer and model of your mobile device<br>

    Your mobile operating system<br>

    The type of mobile Internet browsers you are using<br>

    Your geolocation<br>

    Information about how you interact with the Mobile Application and any of our web

    sites to which the Mobile Application links, such as how many times you use a

    specific part of the mobile application over a given time period, the amount of time

    you spend using the Mobile Application, how often you use the Mobile Application,

    actions you take in the Mobile Application and how you engage with the Mobile

    Application<br>

    Information to allow us to personalize the services and content available through the

    Mobile Application<br>

    We may use information automatically collected by the Mobile Application (including

    the Mobile Device Information) in the following ways:<br>

    To operate and improve our Mobile Applications, other Services, our company’s

    services, and tools<br>

    To create aggregated and anonymized information to determine which Mobile

    Application features are most popular and useful to users, and for other statistical

    analyses;<br>

    To prevent, discover and investigate violations of this Privacy Policy or any

    applicable terms of service or terms of use for the Mobile Application, and to

    investigate fraud, chargeback or other matters;<br>

    To customize the content or services on the Mobile Application for you, or the

    communications sent to you through the Mobile Application.<br>

    With respect to geo-location data we track through your Mobile Device, we use that

    geo-location information for various purposes – including for you to be able to vselect

    the origin or destination easily. Except as otherwise permitted in this Privacy Policy,

    we will not share this information with third parties for any purpose and will only use

    this information for the sole purpose of providing you with the ability to request

    services via Pikkol’s Mobile Application. You may at any time no longer allow our

    Mobile Application to use your location by turning this feature off at the Mobile Device

    level.<br>

    We also provide some of your Personal Information (such as your name , origin and

    destination addresses, contact number, item details) to the Vendor whose quote you

    have selected. The selected Vendor may share that information with its employees,

    partners or agents (that are providing the shipping/relocation service) and will also be

    able to access your Personal Information, including your geo-location data.

    We may associate your unique mobile Device Identifier or Mobile Application usage

    information with any Personal Information you provide, but we will treat the combined

    information as Personal Information.<br>

    Personal Information may also be collected and shared with third-parties if there is

    content from the Mobile Application that you specifically and knowingly upload to,

    share with or transmit to an email recipient, online community, website, or to the

    public, e.g. uploaded photos, posted reviews or comments, or information about you

    or the service that you choose to share with others through features which may be

    provided on our Services. This uploaded, shared or transmitted content will also be

    subject to the privacy policy of the email, online community website, social media or

    other platform to which you upload, share or transmit the content.<br>

    <p class="subhead">2. USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</p>
    Our primary goal in collecting your Personal information or Usage Information is to
    provide you with an enhanced experience when using the Services.<br>

    Based upon the Personal Information you provide us when registering for an

    account, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your username and

    password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to

    provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate

    with you by email, telephone, or SMS or text message, in accordance with your

    wishes.<br>

    We use your information to closely monitor which features of the Services are used

    most, to allow you to view your order history, view any promotions we may currently

    be running, and to determine which features we need to focus on improving,

    including usage patterns and geographic locations to determine where we should

    offer or focus services, features and/or resources.<br>

    We use the information collected from our Mobile Application so that we are able to

    serve you the correct app version depending on your device type, for troubleshooting

    and in some cases, marketing purposes.<br>

    We use your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our

    computer server, and to administer our web site(s). Your IP address is used to help

    identify you, but contains no personal information about you.<br>

    We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is

    necessary to do so. For instance, if our Services are temporarily suspended for

    maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these

    communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive

    them, you have the option to deactivate your account.<br>

    In addition, we may use your Personal Information or Usage Information that we

    collect about you: (1) to provide you with information or services or process

    disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this

    Privacy Policy.<br>

    similar function may not receive a response.<br>

    <p class="subhead">3. HOW AND WHEN DO WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD

      PARTIES?</p>

    We may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user

    statistics and log data, with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling,

    to deliver targeted advertising about other products or services, or for other business

    purposes. We do not sell, share, rent or trade the information we have collected

    about you, including Personal Information, other than as disclosed within this Privacy
    Policy or at the time you provide your information. We do not share your Personal

    <p class="subhead">4. ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING </p>

    Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses information

    collected on an individual's web or mobile browsing behavior such as the pages they

    have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select

    which advertisements should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other

    than our web site(s). For example, if you have shown a preference for nursing while

    visiting our web site(s), you may be served an advertisement for nursing-related

    programs when you visit a site other than our web site(s). The information collected

    is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include

    any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name,

    address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either

    comes from us or through third party website publishers.<br>

    <p class="subhead"> 5. THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SERVICES</p>

    The Services may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third

    parties may collect web site usage information and your Device Identifier when web

    pages from any online or mobile Services are served to your browser. In addition,
    when you are using the Services, you may be directed to other sites or applications

    that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not

    responsible for the privacy practices employed by any of these third parties. For

    example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click may take you away from

    one of our websites onto a different web site. These other web sites may send their

    own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and

    may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We encourage you to note

    when you leave our Services and to read the privacy statements of all third party web

    sites or applications before submitting any Personal Information to third parties.

    <p class="subhead">6. SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES AND WIDGETS</p>

    Our online and mobile Services may include social media features, such as the

    Facebook Like button, and widgets such as a “Share This” button, or interactive mini-

    <p class="subhead"> 7. CHANGE OF INFORMATION AND CANCELLATION OF ACCOUNT</p>

    You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us,

    such as your contact information provided as part of account registration. If your

    Personal Information changes, or if you no longer desire our Services, you may

    correct, delete inaccuracies, or amend information by making the change on our

    member information page or by contacting us through&nbsp;contact@Pikkol.com. We will

    make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as

    soon as reasonably practicable.<br>

    You may also cancel or modify your communications that you have elected to

    receive from the Services by following the instructions contained within an e-mail or

    by logging into your user account and changing your communication preferences.

    If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information

    to provide you services, contact us through&nbsp;contact@Pikkol.com. We will retain your

    Personal Information and Usage Information (including geo-location) for as long as

    your account with the Services is active and as needed to provide you services. Even

    after your account is terminated, we will retain your Personal Information and Usage

    Information (including geo-location, order history, and transaction history) as needed

    to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, conclude any

    activities related to cancellation of an account, investigate or prevent fraud and other

    inappropriate activity, to enforce our agreements, and for other business reason.

    After a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then may

    be held by us as long as necessary for us to provide our Services effectively, but our

    use of the anonymized data will be solely for analytic purposes.

    <p class="subhead"> 8. SECURITY</p>

    The Personal Information and Usage Information we collect is securely stored within

    our databases, and we use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable

    security practices such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for

    protecting your information - such geo-location information. However, as effective as

    encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee

    the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply

    won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet or wireless

    communication, and any information you transmit to the Company you do at your

    own risk. We recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone.

    <p class="subhead"> 9. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</p>

    From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our

    information practices. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of
    the revised Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the

    latest information on our privacy practices.
