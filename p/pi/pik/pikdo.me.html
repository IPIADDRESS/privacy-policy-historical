                    At Pikdo we value the privacy of our users and it’s important for us that you understand what happens to the information you provide to us. This document is to help you understand how we use, store, collect and disclose your data.

                <h4>Collection of Information</h4>
                <p>
                    You are free to browse this Pikdo without revealing any personal information making it possible to identify you. However, once you have sent us your identifiable personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. We collect two types of information from Users/Organizers of the pikdo: “Automatic Anonymous Information” and “Identifiable Personal Information”.
                </p>

                <h4>Automatic Anonymous Information</h4>
                <p>
                    The Pikdo/Contest Tool make it possible to monitor certain information automatically, based on your behaviour. This information does not identify you personally. We use this information to improve the Content and functionality of the pikdo/Contest Tool, and to better understand and satisfy our visitors. This information may include the browser you use, your IP address or other information. This information is referred to herein as the AAI.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Identifiable Personal Information (IPI)
                </h4>
                <p>
                    IPI is individually identifiable information about you that allows us to identify or contact you. Some of the Pikdo’s functions require asking you for certain IPI, such as your instagram username, instagram password and/or other personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But we do not handle your Instagram passwords directly. We use Instagram's API and OAuth 2.0 protocol to authorize Our users. Our databases are secured with passwords to guard against unauthorized access of Our systems. Only engineer staff members may access data on a need-to-know basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may choose to provide IPI in order to access certain functions on the Pikdo. You can always choose not to provide certain information, but in that case it may be that you cannot use certain of the pikdo’s functions.

We may use and/or share the resulting non-PII with third parties. We may provide some non-personal information to others who help us understand how you use the pikdo.
