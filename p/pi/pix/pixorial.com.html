      When you visit the Site, we automatically collect non-personal information including your IP address and standard web log information, such as your browser type and operating system, the date and time you access the Site, where you linked from, and the pages you visit. We use this information to help us make the Site more useful to visitors. For example, the information helps us determine the number of visitors to the Site and the types of technology our visitors use.  We may use your IP address for additional purposes, including, without limitation, to diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or internet service provider, to tailor advertising based on geographic area or other information derived from your IP address or to provide aggregate information derived from IP addresses to advertisers.
      <br><br>
      While you are browsing, we do not collect any personal information about you, such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, unless you provide it to us voluntarily, for example, by sending us an e-mail message or requesting to be placed on our e-mail list.

    <br>
    <div id="line-break"></div>
    <br>

    <h3>Information We Collect From Registered Users </h3>
    <p class="P1">
      When you open an account with us, we will ask you for your name and email address.  If you are a registered user and you sign up for paid services, you may be asked to provide additional personal information, including, for example:

        We may obtain additional information about you from personal or third party websites, databases, publications, or other publicly available sources. It is your choice to post Content and make it publicly available. You are solely responsible for the Content you post.  We also collect information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, and we store your Content, associated labels and editing meta-data. In addition, if you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. If you give us permission in your privacy and application settings, located at <a href="http://www.pixorial.com/account">http://www.pixorial.com/account</a>, to share your Content with your friends, we may ask you for the names and e-mail addresses of such friends. You can choose not to provide any of the information we request, but then you may not be able to use all of our Services.

        Pixorial does not knowingly collect or maintain any personal information from children under the age of 13. No part of the Site is intended or designed for the purpose of attracting any person under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, do not use the Site.  If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

    <h3>Information We Temporarily Place on Your Computer's Hard Drive </h3>
    <p class="P1">
      A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Pixorial uses temporary cookies in limited ways. When you log into your account, for example, we send a “session cookie” to your computer. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on the Site during the same session, so we do not need to keep asking you for your password. Once you log out or close your browser, the temporary cookies used by Pixorial expire, with the exception of a “remember me” cookie. Pixorial cookies do not generate personal data, do not read personal data from your computer, and are not linked to any information that could be used to identify you.
      <br><br>
      You can always choose not to accept Pixorial's temporary cookies. Your browser instructions contain the information you need to modify your choices about cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, however, you may be unable to use all of our Services.
