				<p>Pixie is a photo sharing community. Our site makes it really easy for you to share
					your photos with your friends and family. We understand however that you may not
					wish to share this experience with "everyone" on the Internet and we therefore take
					your privacy very seriously!</p>
				<p>We provide you with the ability to decide with whom you would like to share your
					photos and information. We provide extensive privacy control that enables you to
					segment your audience into groups, allowing for instance, your family to view "most"
					of your photos ;) but not all... and your friends, well, to view them all! Whatever
					you decide!</p>
				<h2>Our Privacy Principals</h2>
				<ol>
					<li><h3>We want you to have control over the personal information you want to share.</h3>
						<p>Pixie provides you with the ability to create a personal profile. This profile contains
							information about you (including your photos) that you have submitted or uploaded
							for the purpose of sharing with others.</p>
						<p>With each feature, we normally provide you with privacy control allowing you to specify
							with fine details to whom and for what purpose access is granted. Privacy has three
							settings:</p>
						<ul class="bullets">
							<li>"<b>Private</b>" – Other users cannot view your information.</li>
							<li>"<b>Protected</b>" – Only accessible to the users you have selected, e.g. Friends,
								Family.</li>
							<li>"<b>Public</b>" – Accessible to everyone on the internet.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><h3>You should have access to the information others want to share with you.</h3>
						<p>Sharing is a two way street! We want to make it easy for you to be able to access
							the photos and information that others want to share with you. As well as providing
							easy methods of discovering new content, we also provide you with handy notifications
							whenever your friends want to share something with you.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>Safe Use Of Pixie</h2>
				<p>Pixie makes it very easy to upload and share photos... Please be aware that photos
					you upload and comments you make on this site may be copied and passed on by those
					who have access. Use your discretion and consider the appropriateness of your choices!</p>
				<h2>Our Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>The following policy sets out what we do with the information you provide to us while
					visiting Pixie in order to help you make an informed choice about whether or not
					to use this site.</p>
				<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
				<p>By visiting and using Pixie, you provide us with two types of information: personal
					information you choose to disclose when signing up or administering your profile
					and web site usage information collected by us as you use our site.</p>
				<p>By signing up with Pixie, you provide us with personal information, for instance
					your name, email address, gender, date of birth, place of residence and any other
					personal or preference information that your provide to us.</p>
				<p>All visitors to Pixie will have their IP address, browser type and browser capabilities
					recorded. This information is collected by us in order to provide the service. In
					order to facilitate you with a login and a session, we also place cookies, one or
					more tiny text files on your computer. These cookies may persist beyond your usage
					of our site, but can be removed at any time of your choosing without affecting your
					ability to use your computer or our site.</p>
				<p>Our service provides you with the facility to set up a personal profile, upload photos,
					create groups, vote on content, send messages, post comments, perform searches and
					transmit information through various channels. In order to facilitate these features
					and provide a more personalised experience, we need to collect and store information.
					For example, you can visit the profile of one of your friends, view and leave comments
					on their photos. You may also discover other friends that are also using the service
					and link these users to your own account.</p>
				<p>In certain circumstances, when you update your information, we create a backup copy
					of the previous version. This backup enables us to help you recover lost information
					should the need arise.</p>
				<p>By using our service and submitting information to our service, you do so at your
					own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your
					information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
					We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your
					photos and information. Therefore we cannot and do not guarantee that the information
					you post on our site will not be viewed by unauthorised persons. We are not responsible
					for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on
					the site either as a result of malicious intrusion or any other means. You understand
					and acknowledge that even after removal, other users may still have copies of your
					information, it may still be found in search engine caches and other sources around
					the internet over which we have no control.</p>
				<p>All data is stored and processed in the Republic of Ireland. </p>
				<h3>Use of Information Obtained by Pixie</h3>
				<p>Pixie is an online community of users whose primary reason for using the service
					is to share information (including their photos) with others. You can make informed
					choices about who has access to your information by setting your own privacy options.
					As part of the service you may be notified when new information is available to
					view and to facilitate this, we may send you an email or other form of communication.
					Should you not wish to receive communications from us, you may opt out by setting
					the appropriate settings on your account. We do however reserve the right to send
					you notifications about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary notifications.</p>
				<p>Generally, we use the information gathered from our visitors in an aggregate form
					to get a better understanding of where our visitors come from and help us better
					design and organise our website. In addition, we may use the information you provide
					to us in a variety of ways that enable us to better operate, maintain and provide
					you with the features and functionality of Pixie.</p>
				<p>Pixie may also share information in your profile without identifying you as an individual
					to third parties. For example, we may provide advertisers with hints as to what
					might be the most appropriate advert for a certain category of user. This ultimately
					provides you with a more personalised service without compromising your privacy.
				</p>
				<h3>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h3>
				<p>We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where
					we believe such sharing is (a) reasonably necessary to offer the service, (b) legally
					required or (c) permitted by you. For example:</p>
				<ul class="bullets">
					<li>Our site contains RSS feeds that syndicate your information (including photos and
						comments) to outside subscribers with appropriate access. Public feeds contain only
						"Public" information while private feeds contain information appropriate to the
						subcriber's account permissions.</li>
					<li>We don't do everything in house! Therefore it may be necessary to provide our service
						providers with information in order for us to be able to provide you with the service.
						Where we utilise third parties in this regard, we implement reasonable contractual
						and technical protections limiting the use of that information to that directly
						required for providing our service to you.</li>
					<li>In the event of merger with another company or acquisition by another company. In
						this event you will be notified before any information becomes subject to a different
						privacy policy.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Children</h3>
				<p>We take the privacy of children very seriously. Accordingly, we do not knowingly
					collect or maintain personal information from children on this Website. If we are
					informed that personally identifiable information of children has been collected
					without the consent of a parent or guardian, we will take reasonable steps to delete
					any such information.</p>
				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p>We take appropriate precautions to protect your personal information. We have physical,
					electronic, and procedural safeguards in place. Your account information is located
					on a secured server behind a firewall.</p>
				<h3>Your ability to edit and delete your information</h3>
				<p>You can modify or delete any of your profile information at any time by logging into
					your account. Information will be updated within a reasonable time. You can delete
					your Pixie account by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@pix.ie?subject=support@pix.ie" class="email" rel="nofollow" onclick="">support@pix.ie</a>
					. Be aware that even after your account has been deleted, information may persist
					in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available
					to other Pixie users.</p>
				<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
				<p>We may update this policy at any time. Please refer to our <a href="/terms">Terms and Conditions</a>
					for details.</p>
				<p>If you have any questions or suggestions please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@pix.ie?subject=privacy@pix.ie" class="email" rel="nofollow" onclick="">privacy@pix.ie</a>
					. </p>
				<p>You may also contact us to request a copy of the personal information we hold about
					you (subject to a maximum fee of €10.00) and also to correct any inaccuracies in
					your information.</p>
