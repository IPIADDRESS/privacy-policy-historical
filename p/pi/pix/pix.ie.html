                <p>Pix.ie (“Pixie”, “Site”, “Website”) is a photo sharing community. Our site makes
                    it really easy for you to share your photos with people of your choice, e.g. your
                    friends, family.</p>
                <p>We understand however that you may not wish to share this experience with "everyone"
                    on the Internet and because we take your privacy very seriously we provide you with
                    the ability to decide with whom you would like to share your photos and information.
                    We provide extensive privacy control that enables you to segment your audience into
                    groups, allowing for instance, your family to view "most" of your photos ;) but
                    not all... and your friends, well, to view them all! Whatever you decide!</p>
                <h2>General Statement</h2>
                <p>Pixie fully respects your right to privacy and will not collect any personal information
                    about you on this website without your clear permission. Any personal information
                    which you volunteer will be treated with the highest standards of security and confidentiality
                    and in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. This Statement relates
                    to our privacy practices in connection with this website. We are not responsible
                    for the content or privacy practices of other websites. Any external links to other
                    websites are clearly identifiable as such. Some technical terms used in this statement
                    are explained at the end of this page.</p>
                <p>This document is subject to the Terms &amp; Conditions of Use document located at <a href="http://pix.ie/terms">http://pix.ie/terms</a>.</p>
                <h2>Our Privacy Principles</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><h3>We want you to have control over the personal information you want to share.</h3>
                        <p>Pixie provides you with the ability to create a personal profile. This profile contains
                            information about you (including your photos) that you have submitted or uploaded
                            for the purpose of sharing with others.</p>
                        <p>With each feature, we normally provide you with privacy control allowing you to specify
                            with fine details to whom and for what purpose access is granted. Privacy has three
                            settings:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Private" – Other users cannot view your information.</li>
                            <li>"Protected" – Only accessible to your Contacts, e.g. Friends, Family.</li>
                            <li>"Public" – Accessible to everyone on the internet.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>You should have access to the information others want to share with you.</h3>
                        <p>Sharing is a two way street! We want to make it easy for you to be able to access
                            the photos and information that others want to share with you. As well as providing
                            easy methods of discovering new Content, we also provide you with handy notifications
                            whenever your Contacts want to share something with you.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Our Privacy Policy</h3>
                        <p>The following policy sets out what we do with the information you provide to us while
                            visiting the Site in order to help you make an informed choice about whether or
                            not to use this site.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
                        <p>By visiting and using Pixie, you provide us with two types of information: personal
                            information you choose to disclose when signing up or administering your profile
                            and web site usage information collected by us as you use the Site.</p>
                        <p>By signing up with Pixie, you provide us with personal information, for instance
                            your name, email address, gender, date of birth, place of residence and any other
                            personal or preference information that your provide to us.</p>
                        <p>All visitors to Pixie will have their IP address, top-level domain used, the previous
                            website address from which you visited us (including any search terms used), data
                            which shows the traffic of visitors to the Site, browser type and browser capabilities
                            recorded. This information is collected by us in order to provide the service. In
                            order to facilitate you with a login and a session, we also place cookies, one or
                            more tiny text files on your computer. These cookies may persist beyond your usage
                            of the Site, but can be removed at any time without affecting your ability to use
                            your computer or the Site. You should note that technical details which we cannot
                            associate with any identifiable individual do not constitute “personal data” for
                            the purposes of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.</p>
                        <p>Our service provides you with the facility to set up a personal profile, upload photos,
                            create groups, vote on Content, send messages, post comments, perform searches and
                            transmit information through various channels. In order to facilitate these features
                            and provide a more personalised experience, we need to collect and store information.
                            For example, you can visit the profile of one of your Contact, view and leave comments
                            on their photos. You may also discover other friends that are also using the service
                            and link these users to your own account.</p>
                        <p>In certain circumstances, when you update your information, we create a backup copy
                            of the previous version. This backup enables us to help you recover lost information
                            should the need arise.</p>
                        <p>By using pix.ie and submitting information to pix.ie, you do so at your own risk.
                            Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information,
                            please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot
                            control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your photos
                            and information. Therefore we cannot and do not guarantee that the information you
                            post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorised persons. We are not responsible
                            for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on
                            the Site either as a result of malicious intrusion or any other means. You understand
                            and acknowledge that even after removal, other users may still have copies of your
                            information, it may still be found in search engine caches and other sources around
                            the internet over which we have no control.</p>
                        <p>All data is stored and processed in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Use of Information Obtained by Pixie</h3>
                        <p>Pixie is an online community of users whose primary reason for using the service
                            is to share information (including their photos) with others. You can make informed
                            choices about who has access to your information by setting your own privacy options.
                            As part of the service you may be notified when new information is available to
                            view and to facilitate this, we may send you an email or other form of communication.
                            Should you not wish to receive communications from us, you may opt out by setting
                            the appropriate settings on your account. We do however reserve the right to send
                            you notifications about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary notifications.</p>
                        <p>Generally, we use the information gathered from our visitors in an aggregate form
                            to get a better understanding of where our visitors come from and help us better
                            design and organise the Site. In addition, we may use the information you provide
                            to us in a variety of ways that enable us to better operate, maintain and provide
                            you with the features and functionality of Pixie.</p>
                        <p>We may also share information in your profile without identifying you as an individual
                            to third parties. For example, we may provide advertisers with hints as to what
                            might be the most appropriate advert for a certain category of user. This ultimately
                            provides you with a more personalised service without compromising your privacy.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h3>
                        <p>We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where
                            we believe such sharing is (a) reasonably necessary to offer the service, (b) is
                            in our legitimate business interests, (c) legally required or (d) consented to by
                            you. For example: Our site contains RSS feeds that syndicate your information (including
                            photos and comments) to outside subscribers with appropriate access. Public feeds
                            contain only "Public" information while private feeds contain information appropriate
                            to the subscriber's account permissions.</p>
                        <p>We don't do everything in house! Therefore it may be necessary to provide our service
                            providers with information in order for us to be able to provide you with the service.
                            Where we utilise third parties in this regard, we implement contractual and technical
                            protections limiting the use of that information to that directly required for providing
                            our service to you and requiring compliance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and
                            2003.</p>
                        <p>In the event of merger with another company or acquisition by another company, you
                            will be notified before any information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Children</h3>
                        <p>We take the privacy of children very seriously. Accordingly, we do not knowingly
                            collect or maintain personal information from children on the Site. If we are informed
                            that personally identifiable information of children has been collected without
                            the consent of a parent or guardian, we will take reasonable steps to delete any
                            such information.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Security</h3>
                        <p>We take appropriate precautions to protect your personal information. We have physical,
                            electronic, and procedural safeguards in place. Your account information is located
                            on a secured server behind a firewall.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p><strong>Cookies</strong>: Small pieces of information, stored in simple text files,
                            placed on your computer by a web site. Cookies can be read by the web site on your
                            subsequent visits. The information stored in a cookie may relate to your browsing
                            habits on the web page, or a unique identification number so that the web site can
                            "remember" you on your return visit. Generally speaking, cookies do not contain
                            personal information from which you can be identified, unless you have furnished

                            company’s computer), expressed in "internet protocol" code (for example 192.168.72.34).
                            Every computer connected to the web has a unique IP address, although the address
                            may not be the same every time a connection is made.</p>
                        <p><strong>Web Browser</strong>: The software you use to read web pages. Examples are
                            Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, Opera and Safari.</p>
