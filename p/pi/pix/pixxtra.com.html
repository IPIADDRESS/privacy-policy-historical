    <div class="box3 padtop">
      <p>We are committed to protecting our users' privacy!</p>
      <p>We at XXXBlackBook.com offer this Privacy Policy ("Policy") to inform Users of the XXXBlackBook.com ("Website") how we define, collect, use and disclose the personal information you provide to us. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to alter this Policy at any time. Alterations shall become effective immediately once posted on the Website. We will notify you of a substantive change to this Policy by posting a notice of such substantial change on the home page of the Website and we may also email you to notify you of such changes. Your continued use of the Website following the posting of changes and/or modifications will constitute your acceptance of the revised privacy policy.</p>
      <p>By providing personal information to us, and by using the Website or Service, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy.</p>
      <p>Please read this Policy carefully and save it. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, you should leave the Website and discontinue use of the Service immediately. In addition, if you are an individual who wishes to become a Registered User or Member, you must read this Policy and indicate your acceptance of its terms by following the instructions on the <a href="/register">REGISTRATION [http://www.xxxblackbook.com/register]</a> page and check the box labelled "I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. I confirm I have reached the age of majority in my jurisdiction." </p>
      <p>For the purposes of this Policy, "personal information" shall mean any information that can identify an individual directly or through other reasonable means.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box3 padtop">
      <h4>1) Information We Gather Automatically. </h4>
      <p>Each time a visitor visits the Website, our servers collect certain non-personal technical information, including, but not necessarily limited to, the visitor's IP Address, referral data and browser/platform type. This information is recorded by the standard operation of XXXBlackBook.com's Internet servers. We also count, track and aggregate a visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at the Website (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Website, etc.).  The information collected here cannot identify who you are as an individual.  However, we may use your IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet provider to identify you if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect our service, the Website, users or others.</p>
      <p>We may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then at our discretion be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers.  We will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission.</p>
      <p>What are IP Addresses?  An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet provider whenever you're surfing the Internet.  We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information, which means that your session will be logged anonymously.</p>
      <p>What are Cookies?  We use cookies to store visitors' preferences and to record session information, for purposes including ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements, and to customize advertising and web page content for individual users. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier which we transfer to your hard drive through your web browser when you visit our Website. It enables our own system to recognise you when you visit our Website again and improve our service to you. Cookies may also be used to compile aggregate information about areas of our Website that are visited most frequently.</p>
      <p>This traffic information can be used to enhance the content of our Website and make your use of it easier. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on the Website.  Note that you must enable cookies from XXXBlackBook.com in order to use most functions on the Website. Nevertheless, if you wish to reject our cookies, you can configure your browser to do so (instructions for disabling cookies can be found in our FAQs <a href="/main/faq">here</a>. Please note that XXXBlackBook.com allows third parties who are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer in a process that XXXBlackBook.com does not control.  Advertisers' uses of cookies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this Policy.  Therefore, we suggest that you examine the privacy policies of such advertisers to learn how they may collect, use, share and disclose your personal information.</p>

      <h4>2) Information Required for Registration. </h4>

      <p>The choice to provide us with your personal information is always yours. However, your decision to withhold particular information may result in limiting our ability to respond to your inquiries or provide you with the Services you requested. If a new purpose is identified for the use of the information collected, the new purpose will be explained prior to its new use. Unless the new purpose is required by law, your consent is required before information can be used for that purpose. Demographic information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals at any time.</p>
