What sites and services are covered by this Privacy Policy?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">This Privacy Policy describes Pixalate’s privacy practices in relation to our corporate website, </span><span class="c17 c0"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.pixalate.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1524184455853000" class="c1">www.pixalate.com</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">(“</span><span class="c10">Website</span><span class="c0">”), and the products and services that we offer (collectively, the “</span><span class="c10">Services</span><span class="c0">”), which our clients use in the context of digital advertising to benchmark digital advertising inventory
supply quality and identify potentially fraudulent digital advertising inventory.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c0">It applies to information collected: (i) in connection with operation of, access to, and use of our Website and Services,
(ii) when our clients, prospective clients and partners express interest in learning more about Pixalate, and
(iii) in connection with the day-to-day operation of our business. By accessing and using our Website or Services,
you are hereby agreeing to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="heading">2. What do we do with information collected in connection with our Website and Services?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c0">To power portions of our Website, and provide our Services, we collect the categories of information detailed in
section 3 below. We use such collected data to: (i) analyze the quality of digital advertising opportunities,
(ii) provide digital advertising inventory fraud detection services, and (iii) generate digital advertising inventory
quality-related rankings, reports and indices. Because of the nature of our business, we have no reason to—and
do not—combine this collected data with any other data in order to personally identify individual, human
users.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="heading">3. What technologies are used, and data types are collected, in connection with operation of our Website and Services?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Cookies. </span><span class="c0">Cookies are small packets of data that are transmitted to a computer’s storage device in order to enable
the computer to “remember” information about visits to a website. In addition to using cookies in
connection with fraud detection and digital advertisement quality determinations, we use cookies on our Website
and Services as a means to prevent unauthorized access to client-specific, secure content and reports. Please
note that, when accessing client-specific, secure content, you are acting as a representative of your company
and your interactions with our Website and Services in this capacity will be governed by our master services
agreement, terms and conditions of use, or other applicable agreements with your company.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Pixel tags, script tags, SDKs, and macros.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Pixel tags (small, transparent images present on web pages</span><span class="c0">) and script tags (used to define a client-side JavaScript) allow the operator of a web page, or a third party serving
a tag, to set, read, and modify cookies and to collect information directly from internet-connected browsers,
devices or systems. &nbsp;In connection with use of an internet browser (on a desktop computer or mobile device),
a mobile application, or any other internet-connected media-viewing system (i.e., so-called over-the-top (“</span><span class="c10">OTT</span><span class="c0">”) media technologies) upon which pixel tags, script tags, software development kits (which enable third-party
code to run in a mobile application; “</span><span class="c10">SDKs</span><span class="c0">”), or other software code snippets (known as “</span><span class="c10">Macros</span><span class="c0">”) are deployed, our servers or our clients’ servers, as applicable, automatically collect and log
certain information. Such logs may include information about the browser, mobile application or OTT system
accessing a page, application or media, including internet protocol (“</span><span class="c10">IP</span><span class="c3 c0">”) address, browser, application, device or system, user agent, referring URL, information about the page,
application or media where a digital advertisement was to be displayed, the advertisement’s dimensions,
location and viewability, and generalized user interaction data. We use this information to power aspects
of our Website and provide our Services (i.e., for fraud detection and digital advertisement quality assessment
purposes).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="heading">4. What specific data types are collected and received in connection with day-to-day operation of our business,
including with respect to our billing and support of existing clients, marketing and sales to prospective
and existing clients, and human resources-related activities?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">In connection with the day-to-day operation of our business, w</span><span class="c3 c0">e collect and receive the following categories of information:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Contact information. </span><span class="c3 c0">We collect contact information from: (i) visitors to our Website, (ii) direct marketing outreach efforts, (iii)
third-party marketing automation tools, and (iv) our clients’ use of our Services. Contact information
may be provided via browser-based or portable document format (PDF) forms, and may include first name, last name,
email address, job title, name of the organization, street number and name, state/province/region, country, phone
numbers (cell and/or landline), and other information reasonably required for us to respond and engage properly
and expeditiously. This contact information may be used by our sales, customer success, human resources and/or
finance teams to contact our Website visitors and Services clients, as applicable, so that we may provide requested
information, support, training and/or our Services.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Billing information. </span><span class="c3 c0">We collect financial, billing and payment information from our clients, prospective clients (in connection
with credit checks), and third-party vendors, which may include purchase order numbers, account numbers, credit
reports, and/or instructions for wire transfers or ACH transfers. This billing and payment information may be
used to prepare and send invoices, make and receive payments, and otherwise manage our clients’ and third-party
vendors’ accounts.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="heading">5. What technologies are used, and what data types are collected and used, in connection with our day-to-day operations?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Automatic data collection. </span><span class="c0">Like most organizations, we rely on automatic data collection technology, including third-party technologies
(e.g., Google Analytics), when you access and use our Website and Services. These third-party services may use
online tracking technologies to collect information such as your IP address, internet service provider, browser
type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on
particular pages, what sections of our Website or Services you visit, number of links you click while on our
Website or Services, search terms, and other data. Please be advised that if you disable, restrict, or block
cookies, or similarly opt out of or otherwise limit the performance of our Website or Services, or related services
performed by any third party vendor, you may not be able to use the full functionality of our Website and Services.
(For more information on Google Analytics, including how to opt out from certain data collection, please
visit </span><span class="c0 c14 c27"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/analytics&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1524184455856000" class="c1">https://www.google.com/analytics.</a></span><span class="c3 c0">)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Other third-party services. </span><span class="c3 c0">Third-party services incorporated into our Website, such as social media widgets (e.g., LinkedIn Like button
or the Twitter Share button), online advertising networks or job applicant tracking services, may collect information
about your visits to our Website for other purposes, including interest-based advertising. You may choose to
provide information voluntarily to such third-party service providers, and the information that they collect
may include personal information such as IP addresses, pages visited, times and dates of visits, browser or operating
system configuration, and other usage data. &nbsp;Third-party service providers may combine information that
you provide with information collected from other sites. Because we do not host or control such third-party services,
your interactions with these services will not be governed by this Privacy Policy; instead, such interactions
will be governed by the privacy policy of the third-party service provider.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Use of a</span><span class="c2">ggregated data. </span><span class="c3 c0">In an ongoing effort to better understand our Website visitors and Services clients, we may analyze information
in an aggregated form to operate, maintain, manage, and improve our Website and Services. Aggregate information
is anonymous (i.e., it does not identify individuals personally). We may share aggregated data with our clients
and Website visitors, as well as with our agents and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated statistics
to prospective business partners and other third parties, in order to describe our Website and Services and for
other lawful purposes.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Additional data uses. </span><span class="c3 c0">We also use contact information, billing information and other information collected pursuant to this Privacy
Policy to respond to general inquiries, solicit feedback regarding our Services, deployment, training and support,
provide relevant content on our Website, and communicate with you via email regarding our current and future
Services.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="heading">6. Under what circumstances would data be transferred, and what safeguards are in place regarding data transfer?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Onward transfer of data to third parties. </span><span class="c0">Like many businesses, we hire third-party vendors to perform certain business-related services. We may disclose
personal information to certain types of third-party vendors but only to the extent reasonably required to enable
them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive personal information, and their functions
include: direct marketing assistance, billing, client service, data storage, Website and Services hosting, and
disaster-recovery services. All such third-party vendors function as our agents, performing services at our instruction
and on our behalf pursuant to contracts that require that they provide at least the same level of privacy protection
as is required by this Privacy Policy and applicable law, and as implemented by Pixalate. You may opt out of
having your personal information transferred to any or all of our categories of agents by contacting us at </span><span class="c0 c14">privacy@pixalate.com</span><span class="c3 c0">. Please allow us a reasonable time to process your request.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Business-transaction-related transfers. </span><span class="c3 c0">In the event of a merger, dissolution, reorganization or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially
all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personal information, would
be transferred to the surviving entity in such a merger or the acquiring entity. All such transfers shall be
subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such personal information as set
forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is binding upon Pixalate and its legal successors in interest.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Disclosure of personal information in connection with legal and administrative proceedings. </span><span class="c3 c0">We are required from time to time to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public
authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also
be required to disclose personal information in the course of defending ourselves in litigation, and to third
parties when compelled to do so by governmental authorities or as otherwise required by law or regulation (including,
but not limited to, in response to court and administrative orders and subpoenas). &nbsp;In all such circumstances,
we will make reasonable efforts to maintain confidentiality of such personal information.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="heading">7. May you review, correct, modify or delete any of your personal information that we possess?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0 c15">You may request to review, correct, modify or delete any of the personal information that you have previously provided
to us. To update your billing information, or request return or deletion of your data associated with your account,
please contact your account representative or our customer success team. &nbsp;For other requests to access,
correct, modify or delete your personal information, please email </span><span class="c0 c22">privacy@pixalate.com</span><span class="c0 c15 c18">. &nbsp;Requests to access, change, or delete your personal information will be addressed within a reasonable timeframe.
If we are merely a processor of your personal information, we encourage you to contact the third-party controller
of your personal information directly for assistance in accessing, correcting, updating or deleting such information.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="heading">8. How long is personal information retained, and what steps are taken to safeguard personal information?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Retention of personal information.</span><span class="c0">We will retain your personal information in a form that identifies you only for as long as it reasonably serves
the purpose(s) for which it was initially collected, or for a purpose that you authorized subsequently, and,
in both circumstances, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In the event that we continue processing your
personal information for longer periods, it will only be for the time and to the extent reasonably required for
a lawful and permissible purpose (e.g., archival, compelling public interest, journalism, literature, scientific
or historical research, and statistical analysis), and subject to the protections afforded by this Privacy Policy
and applicable law. After such time periods have expired, we may either delete your personal information or retain
it in an anonymous form that does not identify you personally.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">How we protect personal information.</span><span class="c3 c0">Pixalate takes protection of the security and privacy of personal information that we collect pursuant to this
Privacy Policy very seriously. Accordingly, we have implemented and will maintain reasonable and appropriate
technical, administrative and physical measures designed to protect personal information from loss, misuse and
unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. &nbsp;We will take into account the risks involved
in processing, and the nature of such personal information, and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</span></p><p class="c6"> <span class="heading">9. Is your Website or Services collecting information from children, or directed in any way towards children?</span></p><p id="h.42yg3tdro2ro" class="c6"><span class="c0">We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 in connection with our Website
or Services, and our business is not directed in any way towards children. If you are under age 13, please do
use our Website or Services, and do not give us any personal information. If you have reason to believe that
a child under the age of 13 has provided any personal information to us, please contact us at </span><span class="c0 c14">privacy@pixalate.com</span><span class="c3 c0">, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases expeditiously.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="heading">10. Do you exercise any control over the privacy practices of third-party websites to which you may link?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Our Website may contain links to third party websites (“</span><span class="c10">External Sites</span><span class="c3 c0">”). Pixalate has no control over the privacy practices of these External Sites. As such, we are not responsible
for the privacy policies of those External Sites. You should check the applicable third-party privacy policy,
and applicable terms and conditions of use, when visiting any External Sites, and before providing any personal
information to such External Sites.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="heading">11. Does the European Union (“EU”)’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) apply
to you?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">GDPR effective date and applicability.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The GDPR comes into force across the EU on 25 May 2018. The GDPR applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of
data relating to identified or identifiable human end users in the EU (“</span><span class="c10">Data Subjects</span><span class="c3 c0">”). The GDPR describes system- and device-related identifiers like IP addresses, unique device IDs, and cookie
IDs as “pseudonymous” forms of Data Subjects’ personal information.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Pseudonymous information.</span><span class="c3 c0">Information in pseudonymous form is commonly collected and processed in connection with digital advertising.
Even though operation of our Website and Services do not require processing or storage of names, phone numbers,
house numbers, street addresses, or similarly-identifying data elements of Data Subjects—nor does operation
of our Website and Services require processing or storage of sensitive personal information of Data Subjects,
such as governmental ID numbers or personal health information—the GDPR still applies to our business.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Fraud prevention is a legal basis under Article 6 and Recital 47 of the GDPR. </span><span class="c0">Article 6 of the GDPR requires a legal basis for the processing of a Data Subject’s personal data. The
GDPR provides a right to process the personal data of Data Subjects to further a company’s own “legitimate
interests,” or the legitimate interests of a third party, provided that doing so will not infringe adversely
upon the fundamental rights and freedoms of the applicable Data Subjects.</span><span class="c0 c26">&nbsp; </span><span class="c3 c0">Recital 47 of the GDPR states expressly that the “processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes
of preventing fraud” constitutes a legitimate interest, and such provision serves as our legal basis for
the processing of Data Subjects’ personal data in connection with operation of our Website and Services.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Express consent is a legal basis under GDPR Article 6. </span><span class="c0">Another permissible legal basis to process a Data Subject’s personal data is express consent from the
Data Subject. We may utilize such basis from time to time in connection with our direct marketing efforts to
Data Subjects. With respect to the processing of client and client-prospect data relating to Pixalate’s
business, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that our consent mechanisms for obtaining personal data of
Data Subjects enable them to understand what consent(s) they are providing, and why and how we use such consent(s);
and we give clear, defined ways to consent to us controlling and/or processing such Data Subject personal data.
Where we use any third party to process Data Subjects’ personal data on our behalf (</span><span class="c0 c28">e.g., employee payroll, recruitment, and benefits</span><span class="c0">), we will enter into reasonable data-processor agreements and establish (and update from time to time) due diligence
procedures for ensuring that they (</span><span class="c0">as well as we</span><span class="c3 c0">), meet and understand their/our GDPR obligations. These measures will include initial and ongoing reviews of the
service provided, the necessity of the processing activity, the technical and organizational measures in place
to ensure reasonable data protection and compliance with the GDPR.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Hosting on third-party platforms.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Pixalate’s Services run on Amazon Web Services (“</span><span class="c10">AWS</span><span class="c0">”) and the Google Cloud Platform. The EU data protection authorities, acting collectively as the Article 29
Working Party, approved: (i) Google’s “</span><span class="c17 c0"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri%3DOJ:L:2010:039:0005:0018:EN:PDF&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1524184455862000" class="c1">model clauses</a></span><span class="c0">” based agreements for its Cloud Platform, and (ii) Amazon’s </span><span class="c0 c17"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/eu-data-protection/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1524184455863000" class="c1">AWS Data Processing Agreement (DPA)</a></span><span class="c3 c0">.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="heading">13. How do California residents submit requests for information under California’s privacy rights regulation?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to obtain certain
information about the types of personal information that companies with whom they have an established business
relationship (and that are not otherwise exempt) have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes
during the preceding calendar year, including the names and addresses of those third parties, and examples of
the types of services or products marketed by those third parties. If you wish to submit a request pursuant to
Section 1798.83, please contact Pixalate via email at <span class="c0 c14">privacy@pixalate.com</span><span class="c3 c0">.</span></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="heading">14.

transfer of your personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes, by emailing us at </span><span class="c0 c22">privacy@pixalate.com</span><span class="c3 c0">. Please allow us a reasonable time to process your request. If you are a Pixalate client company, you may not

devices or systems.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">“Do Not Track” signals.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c15">Currently, various browsers—including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari—offer a “do not track”
or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites
visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. At present, Pixalate does not commit
to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to our Website or Services, in part, because no common
industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators. Accordingly,
there is not presently a consistent standard for interpreting user intent. Pixalate takes privacy and meaningful
choice seriously and will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation
of any such standards.</span></p><p class="c6"> <span class="heading">15.
