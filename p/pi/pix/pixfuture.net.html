        <p> <strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>PixFuture is deeply committed to protecting   the privacy of Internet users.</strong><br>
          Accordingly, we strictly adhere to all industry   guidelines, and will continue to review and improve our                privacy policy and procedures to ensure the safety and   protection of consumer information. This Privacy                 Statement presents our privacy policy, including PixFuture's  privacy practices for our web site.                Below is information regarding PixFuture's   commitment to protecting the privacy of Internet users. </p>
        <h5>Consumer Information </h5>
        <p> PixFuture uses own or  third party ad serving   technology to serve ads at this site and at                 our clients' sites. In the course of delivering an ad to   you, the third party ad serving party may                  place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser and   use information (not including your name,                  address, email address or telephone number) about your   visits to this and other Web sites in order                  to provide advertisements about goods and services that   may be of interest to you </p>
        <h5>Cookies and Opt Out</h5>
        <p> Like most Internet sites, PixFuture and its third   party ad serving party uses "cookies" to                  enhance the Internet user's experience on the Web.   Neither PixFuture nor such third party                  ad serving party uses these cookies to personally   identify you in any way, and these cookies in                  no way damage your system or files. </p>
        <h5>What are cookies and how do they   enhance your Web experience?</h5>
        <p> A cookie is a unique number that is assigned to you the   first time you are served an ad. This number is                  stored in a file on your computer. For instance, cookies   help ensure that you don't repeatedly see the                   same ad. Cookies can also help advertisers measure how   you utilize an advertiser's site and the effectiveness                  of an ad. This information can then be used by   advertisers to better cater to your needs. In other words, cookies                  help us deliver to you the types of ads in which you are   more interested.<br>
          Although we believe that cookies help enhance your   experience on the Web (by not repeatedly serving the same                   ads to you and delivering more relevant messages to   you), neither PixFuture nor its third party ad                   serving party needs cookies to deliver ads to you. </p>
        <h5>Opt Out</h5>
        <p> If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a   simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature.                   In order to "opt out" of the benefits of cookies, you   may manually delete your cookies by following the instructions                   contained in the Help section of your browser. </p>
        <h5>Industry Efforts to Protect Consumer   Privacy</h5>
        <p> PixFuture is committed to protecting the privacy   of Internet users. Accordingly, we strictly adhere to all                    industry guidelines, including those established by the   Direct Marketing Association. If you should have any questions                    or concerns regarding this Privacy Statement, please   contact our Customer Services at contact@pixfuture.com.                      We recommend that you periodically review this Privacy   Statement, as PixFuture may update it from time to time. </p>
        <h5>Third Party Advertising</h5>
        <p> We use PixFuture and other third-party   advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.                   These companies may use information (not including your   name, address, email address or telephone number)                    about your visits to this and other Web sites in order   to provide advertisements on this site and other                   sites about goods and services that may be of interest   to you. If you would like more information about                    this practice and to know your choices about not having   this information used by these companies, please click here </p>
        <h5>Third Party Cookies</h5>
