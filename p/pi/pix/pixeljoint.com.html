<br><br>

<strong>Collection of your Personal Information </strong><br>
PixelJoint.com collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address, telephone number, demographic information, and information that is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. 
<br><br>
PixelJoint.com does not associate sensitive data, such as your race, religion, or political affiliations, with personally identifiable information. PixelJoint.com takes precautions to segregate any sensitive data you may provide on PixelJoint.com and services that reference your race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity or political affiliations.
