			</li>
			<li>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span>Payment Information. </span>If you choose to use a paid Pixlee account or service, our payment processing vendor collects your credit card information and billing address.</p>
				
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Our Use of Your Information</h3>
		<p>We use the information we gather on our website, whether personal, demographic or technical, for the purpose of operating and improving our web site, fostering a positive user experience and delivering the products and services that we offer.  We may also use the information we gather to inform you of other products or services available from us or our affiliated companies. </p>

			<li><p>• To conduct marketing analysis, to send you surveys or newsletters, to contact you about services, products, activities, special events or offers from Pixlee or our partners and for other marketing, informational, product development and promotional purposes;</p></li>

		</ul>
		<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
		<p>When uploading pictures, a name and an email address may be required depending on the contest settings. Generally, the information Pixlee collects helps us to communicate with you regarding content that you have submitted through the Pixlee. For instance, we may use your email address to provide you with an email to notify you of the status of the content you have submitted. Furthermore, our licensees whose sites you have submitted content to through Pixlee, may use your email address to communicate with you from time to time or to contact you when you have won a contest. </p>

		<p>When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and Services, and for the Site's technical administration.</p>

		<p>We will not share, rent or sell your personally-identifiable information with any entity, except as set forth in our Data Release Policy below.</p>
		<h3>Public Forums</h3>
		<p>Pixlee offers publicly accessible blogs.  You should be aware that any information you provide on our blog may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.  To request removal of your personal information from our blog, contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@pixleeteam.com">legal@pixleeteam.com</a>.</p>
		<h3>Cookies</h3>
		<p>Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. Pixlee may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and Services.</p>

		<p>A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our Services and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>

		<h3>IP Address and Clickstream Data</h3>
		<p>Our server may collect data about your server’s Internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Internet. When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about our customers as a whole, but does not include personally identifiable information. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Site; the Web site you visit after this Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers. In addition we may track the photos you like on our site to provide you with better service. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Site. Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may link this information with your personal information.</p>

		<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Site usage information may be performed on our behalf by our service providers, including, for example, our analytics vendor(s) and our e-mail management partner(s).</p>
		<h3>Data Release Policy</h3>
		<ul>
		<p>Our policy is to only release the data we collect in the following circumstances:</p>
		<li><p>• To our licensees whose sites you have submitted content to.</p></li>
		<li><p>• As required by law.</p></li>
		<li><p>• To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints.</p></li>
		<li><p>• When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually when investigating technical issues.</p></li>
		<li><p>• For abusive users, we may release information to assist in attempting to block the abusive user or to complain to that user's Internet Service Provider.</p></li>
		<li><p>	• If necessary to defend against legal claims.</p></li>
		<li><p>	• When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of the user community, or this Site.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Service Providers</h3>
		<p>We may use third party partners to help operate the Site and deliver our features and Services, and may share your information with our affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide products or Services for or through this Site or for our business (such as Web site or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf).</p>
		<h3>No Selling of Information</h3>
		<p>We will not sell, lease or give your personally identifiable information collected via this site (such as your email address) to third parties except as otherwise explicitly stated in this Policy.</p>
		<h3>Securing Your Information</h3>
		<p>Pixlee is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. Due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we make no guarantee as to the security of your information or that your information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. </p>
		<h3>Phishing</h3>
		<p>It has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity is known as “phishing”.</p>

		<p>If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a Web site that does not seem to be affiliated with Pixlee, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at <a href="mailto:Legal@pixleeteam.com">legal@pixleeteam.com</a></p>
		<h3>Third Party Links</h3>
		<p>Our Site or Services may contain links to third party websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
		<h3>Business Transfer</h3>
		<p>Pixlee regards its databases of customer information (including personal information) as a valuable asset. In the event that Pixlee is or substantially all of its assets are, acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, such databases containing personal information may be one of the transferred assets. In using the Services you consent to such transfer of your personal information.</p>
		<h3>Our Policy Towards Minors</h3>
		<p>Pixlee’s Site or Service are in no way directed to persons under the age of 18 unless they have obtained parental or guardian consent. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at a href="mailto:Legal@pixleeteam.com"&gt;legal@pixleeteam.com.</p>
		<h3>Changes to Privacy Statement</h3>
		<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post all changes to this Privacy Policy on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the Privacy Policy’s effective date.  We therefore encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our services and our web site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.</p>

		<p>If you send our Designated Agent a valid, written Counter Notice meeting the requirements described above, we will restore your removed or disabled material within 10 to 14 business days from the date we receive your Counter Notification, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the party filing the original Notice informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question.</p>

		<p>Please note that if you misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney's fees.</p>
		<h3>C. Repeat Infringer Policy</h3>
		<p>In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, we will, at our discretion, disable and/or terminate access to the Platform by users who may infringe or repeatedly infringe the copyrights of others. This determination will be based on the number of “strikes” against the user. A “strike” is counted against a user each time there is an adjudication by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction that the user has engaged in copyright infringement of any kind in relation to the Platform.</p>

		<p>Each adjudication counts as a separate strike. If an adjudication pertains to multiple instances of copyright infringement, it can count as multiple strikes. Pixlee has adopted a “three strikes and you’re out” policy under which a user who accumulates three strikes is considered a repeat infringer and may be subject to account termination.</p>
