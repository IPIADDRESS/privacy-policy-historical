With so many creators, brands, and viewers influencing the conversation, the gaming space has developed its own unique set of content types. By understanding these content types -- and which ones attract the most views and engagements -- brand marketers can make an impact on the gamers that matter most to them.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the best-performing gaming content on YouTube:\r\n\r\nParody and let\u2019s play content drives the most total views on YouTube, but brand-owned trailers also attract a large volume of views and engagements before a game or console launch. However, post-launch audiences turn to creators for game and console content over brand-owned videos.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9089\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Top-Gaming-Video-Performance-by-Video-Type-300x134.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"312\" \/>\r\n\r\nBrand-owned TV ads repurposed on YouTube generate the most average views per video across gaming content types on the platform -- most likely due to brands\u2019 investment in paid advertising, targeting gamers before a launch -- yet TV ads generate the fewest engagements on average. While reaction and game music videos attract a low viewership on average, these content types dominate when it comes to average engagements. Overall, comedy content -- such as parody, prank, or sketch videos -- attracts the most views and engagements on average.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9090\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Average-Performance-of-Gaming-Videos-by-Video-Type-300x98.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"230\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe top creators attract 8X more views and 15X more engagements than top gaming brands -- indicating that there\u2019s significant room for brand marketers to bring their advertising to the next level. By and large, gaming brands are losing their audience to creators after game or console launches, and missing the significant opportunity to generate longtail impact by diversifying their content portfolio. By adopting creator best practices -- such as producing long-form, digital-first content in a variety of engaging content types -- brand marketers can extend the life of their advertising, and make an impact on the right gamers at the right time.\r\n\r\nFor more insights on the gaming audience across social video platforms, as well as a breakdown of which brands are making the most of their social video investment, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/industry-insights\/next-level-gaming-brands-can-win-across-social-video\/\">download Pixability\u2019s gaming study today<\/a>.","post_title":"Here\u2019s what gamers are viewing across social video platforms","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"heres-gamers-viewing-social-video","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-10-27 14:33:14","post_modified_gmt":"2017-10-27 18:33:14","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/?p=9085","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","robotsmeta":null},{"ID":9070,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-09-27 06:07:49","post_date_gmt":"2017-09-27 10:07:49","post_content":"More and more, beauty and personal care consumers are turning to social video platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat to understand which products and brands are right for them.

Consumer electronics brands continue to release exciting new devices, but it can be a challenge for consumers to understand how devices and brands differ, how the most innovative products will improve their daily lives, and which devices to choose when making a product decision.\r\n\r\nModern audiences are turning to YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to research and compare devices, share their experiences and opinions, and make brand decisions -- before shifting to web search to make their purchase.\r\n<h3>The Consumer Electronics Audience<\/h3>\r\nWhat\u2019s the demographic breakdown of this audience that\u2019s hungry for gadget and device content? On Facebook, the 600M-strong audience that\u2019s interested in consumer electronics skews slightly male and heavily young, with 18-34 year-olds accounting for nearly 70% of interactions.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9061\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/2ce2-300x163.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"271\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9062\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/2ce1-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"253\" \/>\r\n\r\nOn Twitter, the 18-24 year old demographic also commands the consumer electronics space, at 65% of the 200K-person audience that\u2019s discussing consumer electronics purchases. 13-17 year olds and 25-34 year olds control a smaller, but comparable, share of the consumer electronics conversation at 15% &amp; 14%, respectively. 31% of the consumer electronics audience on Twitter works in a professional\/technical capacity, followed by 28% that are homemakers.\r\n<h3>Consumer Electronics Viewership<\/h3>\r\nThe growth and development of the consumer electronics space on YouTube in particular is particularly significant, as the platform has long been consumers\u2019 destination of choice for video content. Views of consumer electronics content on YouTube grew by an average of 44% year-over-year from 2012 to 2016, with total views currently clocking in at 154B views. The more than 11M consumer electronics videos -- spread across 1.1M channels -- have attracted 48B engagements in total. And consumer interest shows no signs of waning -- Pixability\u2019s data indicates that the CE space will garner 63B views on YouTube in 2017 alone.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9063\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/2ce3-300x162.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"324\" \/>\r\n\r\nYouTube may have a historical advantage, but each social video platform offers a variety of unique ad formats, sophisticated targeting options, and audience engagement opportunities. It\u2019s vital that consumer electronics marketers understand these platform differences, as well as the advertising advantages of each when formulating their video strategies. By adopting a holistic cross-platform approach, brands can connect with consumers along their digital journey, and follow them from platform to platform to help shape their brand and product decisions.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/contact-us\">Contact us today<\/a> to get your hands on more of Pixability\u2019s consumer electronics insights.","post_title":"Understanding the consumer electronics space across the social video landscape","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"understanding-consumer-electronics-space-across-social-video-landscape","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-09-21 11:07:37","post_modified_gmt":"2017-09-21 15:07:37","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/?p=9059","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","robotsmeta":null},{"ID":9050,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-09-21 10:01:44","post_date_gmt":"2017-09-21 14:01:44","post_content":"The audience looking for consumer electronics content on social video is massive -- but how can CE marketers maximize the impact of their content to reach the right audience at scale?\r\n\r\nWe uncovered a number of insights in our recent analysis of the CE space across social video platforms to help do just that.\r\n\r\nFor example, 71% of top brand consumer electronics videos are less than 3 minutes in length, but these short-form videos deliver a mere 0.33% average engagement rate. Longer videos on the other hand (3 minutes and longer) average a 0.82% engagement rate.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9053\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/ce1a-300x188.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"377\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9054\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/ce2b-300x159.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"318\" \/>\r\n\r\nAudiences also view and engage with certain CE content types on YouTube more than others -- and brand marketers should invest in producing the video types that best align with their specific marketing goals. 51% of videos in the consumer electronics space are commercials -- far and away the most common CE video published -- but this type of video earns the second-lowest engagement rate on average, at 0.18%. Destruction and product teaser videos generate the highest engagement rates, at 1.02% and 0.85% respectively. Reviews (which are largely creator-produced), and brand-owned product information videos attract the most views, at 40.4M and 32.9M average views respectively. This indicates that while consumers overwhelmingly turn to their trusted creators for product reviews, brands are investing in paid media to drive viewership of their product info videos, seeking to meet the demand -- historically filled by creators -- for insights on devices.\r\n<h3>Brand-owned Content Types:<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2iNTxLXO-Iw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commercial<\/a>: A 15 or 30 second TV ad repurposed for digital.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=a0a6Y9JvPqo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Product Teaser<\/a>: An introduction to a new product or product line, giving consumers a glimpse at a forthcoming release.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x76VEPXYaI0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Product Demonstration<\/a>: An explainer video that highlights a product in action, showing how the device would typically be used.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I_KwdkRbQdg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Short Film<\/a>: A long-form, brand-produced video that shines a light on the real-world benefits of a device.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Creator Content Types:<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yWYHHNADK04\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Destruction<\/a>: A video that tests the limits of consumer electronics, frequently by dropping, bending, submerging devices.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6Cf7IL_eZ38\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Product Information<\/a>: A video that takes a deep dive into device features, specs, and technical details.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9bKoahtmcHY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Concept<\/a>: Typically produced by a creator, these videos imagine possibilities for future devices and features.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XNBP18nrRdw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parody<\/a>: A comedy video that lampoons features, brands, or products in the market.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CEt8U4HKmek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tips\/Tricks<\/a>: A video that explains how to improve a consumer\u2019s experience with a device.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=657UeODW178\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Review<\/a>: A thorough examination of a product and its features, typically including comparisons to competing or preceding products.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9055\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/CE4-300x174.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"347\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9056\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/CE3-300x152.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"303\" \/>\r\n<h3>CE Creators vs Brands<\/h3>\r\nBrands own a considerable share of the consumer electronics space -- nearly 9% of total views, (significantly higher than the 3% that beauty brands control within the of the beauty space) that brands control) -- indicating that CE brands are producing a high volume of content, and investing in paid media to drive viewership. While CE creators attract a wide following through engaging content like destruction and unboxing videos, brands\u2019 large share of the CE space shows that audiences are still receptive to brand-owned content.\r\n\r\nThe top 10 most-viewed consumer electronics brands on YouTube have a combined subscriber base of 33M, and have published 170K videos across 560 active channels, drawing 13.3B views and 48M engagements in total. On average, brand-owned CE videos receive around 77K views and a 0.36% engagement rate.\r\n\r\nTop brand and creator videos attract comparable view counts on average, but creator videos generate roughly 3X more engagements than brand-owned videos. In order to close this gap, brand marketers should follow creator best practices when building their video strategies, taking a cue from popular influencers like EverythingApplePro or TechnoBuffalo, and consider partnering with leading and emerging CE creators to coincide with a new product launch.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/jon4lakers\">TechnoBuffalo<\/a><\/strong>: This popular channel features reviews and comparisons of smartphones and tech products to help consumers understand the latest devices.

This creator also produces entertaining destruction videos that have propelled it to the top of the CE creator charts.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9057\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/CE8-300x188.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"282\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9058\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/CE7-300x170.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"255\" \/>\r\n\r\nSuccessful CE creators who built their loyal following on YouTube have been increasingly moving away from producing content solely for YouTube, extending their influence across other walled gardens. Forward-thinking brand advertisers should take a page from creators\u2019 books, and approach the social video ecosystem with a similar holistic, cross-platform strategy.\r\n\r\nWant to learn more about building video ad campaigns that leverage the advantages of each social video platform? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/contact-us\">Contact us today<\/a> to set up a meeting and get your hands on the full CE study.","post_title":"Engaging the consumer electronics audience","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"engaging-consumer-electronics-audience","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-09-21 10:01:44","post_modified_gmt":"2017-09-21 14:01:44","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/?p=9050","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","robotsmeta":null},{"ID":9042,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-08-31 14:46:09","post_date_gmt":"2017-08-31 18:46:09","post_content":"Did you know that mobile gaming occupies only 4.3% of the total gaming space on YouTube, but this small segment still accounts for more than 60B views?\r\n\r\nThe gaming community has developed a rich and engaged community across YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Twitch.

But now Facebook has completely restructured the video tab, with an exclusive focus on professionally-produced medium- to long-form video content. Nothing remains of friends\u2019 video or livestreams.\r\n\r\n<center><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9027\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/1-170x300.png\" alt=\"Facebook watch tab\" width=\"250\" height=\"440\" \/><\/center>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of the video content is supplied by professional media outlets like Buzzfeed, but popular YouTube-centric creators like Tastemade and the Fine Brothers are featured as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All video content is in a 16:9 aspect ratio, likely with an eye toward streaming delivery on connected TVs and video streaming devices such as Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV. Interestingly, closed captions are turned on by default, making the videos more mobile friendly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<center><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9028\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/2-270x300.png\" alt=\"Facebook watch tab\" width=\"250\" height=\"277\" \/><\/center>\r\n\r\nShows have their own individual pages, which look a lot like YouTube channels.

During our tests, we saw a handful of Facebook house ads delivered in a mid-roll format, so the platform is clearly testing user reactions to this monetization approach. Facebook has announced that there will be a revenue share program with content producers, wherein Facebook keeps 55% of ad revenue (similar to YouTube\u2019s structure).<\/p>\r\n\r\nThe video search feature still exists and displays a mix of different video types, but there\u2019s a clear focus on the the new professional-caliber shows.\r\n\r\n<center><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9031\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/5-162x300.png\" alt=\"Facebook watch tab\" width=\"250\" height=\"464\" \/><\/center>\r\n\r\nThe new video tab is reminiscent of Snapchat\u2019s Discover tab, as well as some of the more popular parts of YouTube, including the channels featured on Google Preferred.\r\n\r\nThis update will likely increase watch time on Facebook by encouraging users to view professionally-produced content in a dedicated space for video, and will likely provide a more advertiser-friendly video environment.

With so many creators, brands, and viewers influencing the conversation, the gaming space has developed its own unique set of content types. By understanding these content types -- and which ones attract the most views and engagements -- brand marketers can make an impact on the gamers that matter most to them.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the best-performing gaming content on YouTube:\r\n\r\nParody and let\u2019s play content drives the most total views on YouTube, but brand-owned trailers also attract a large volume of views and engagements before a game or console launch.

While reaction and game music videos attract a low viewership on average, these content types dominate when it comes to average engagements. Overall, comedy content -- such as parody, prank, or sketch videos -- attracts the most views and engagements on average.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-9090\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pixability.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Average-Performance-of-Gaming-Videos-by-Video-Type-300x98.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"230\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe top creators attract 8X more views and 15X more engagements than top gaming brands -- indicating that there\u2019s significant room for brand marketers to bring their advertising to the next level. By and large, gaming brands are losing their audience to creators after game or console launches, and missing the significant opportunity to generate longtail impact by diversifying their content portfolio.
