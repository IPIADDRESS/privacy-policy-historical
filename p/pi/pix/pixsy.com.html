      you will need to provide personally identifiable information

      Collected.</b> As part of the registration process to create 
      an account or to participate in Special Promotions, you may

      Pixsy will automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable 
      information about your use of the Site and services provided

      system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service 
      provider, your "click path" through the Site, or

      visited, and your IP address. To do this, Pixsy may use cookies 
      and other technology (see below). Your visits to the Site, 
      and information provided through these technologies, will 
      be anonymous unless you provide us with personally identifiable 
      information or have provided such information in the past. 
      </div>
    <div class="text"><b>8. Cookies.</b> The Site and advertisements 
      contained on it may contain "cookies." A cookie is a piece

      gifs, frames, server log analysis and other technologies as 
      they are developed to customize your experience with the Site. 
      Personally identifiable information (and other information 
      that may be associated with your personally identifiable information) 
      collected through the use of these technologies will be handled 
      in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Most Internet browsers 
      will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, 
      block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a 
      cookie is stored. Please note, however, that if you block 
      cookies, many portions of the Site will not function properly. 
      You should refer to your browser instructions or help screen 
      to learn more about how to manage cookies. </div>
    <div class="text"><b>9. Use of Personal Information Collected 
      at the Site. </b>Pixsy uses information about you to operate

      sweepstakes, or to provide other support for a Service or 
      Special Promotion). By participating in such services, you 
      are deemed to consent to the disclosure of your personally 
      identifiable information to these third parties. Third parties 
      who provide prize fulfillment and/or sweepstakes administration 
      will be given your information to carry out their responsibilities 
      in connection with any Special Promotion in which you participate. 
      You should always review the privacy policy of any third party

      Purchase to determine how your information will be used by 
      that entity. </div>

      we have been given your consent to disclose; <b>(b)</b> we 
      have previously informed you of the disclosure; <b>(c)</b> 
      we are required by law or court order to disclose or to comply 
      with any legal or regulatory requirement, including without 
      limitation in connection with a search warrant or demand for

      contact, or bring legal action against, someone who may cause 
      or be causing harm to, or interference with, Pixsy's rights 
      or property, other Site users, or anyone else. Pixsy may also 
      use IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet service 
      provider to identify users if Pixsy deems it necessary to 
      enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy or to protect 
      our Site, Pixsy customers or others. You consent to the disclosure 
      to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of the Site, 
      of any and all information about you contained in the applicable 
      Site database, if Pixsy assigns its rights and obligations 
      in connection with the Site or is otherwise acquired via merger, 
      acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of Pixsy's 
      assets to a subsequent owner or operator. In any such event, 
      you acknowledge that the use and storage or your personal 
      information will be governed by the <i>Privacy Policy </i> 
      of the Site's subsequent owner or operator. In addition to

      identifiable user information to show general demographic 
      and preference information among users of the Site. </div>
    <div class="text"><b>12. Data Security.</b> While Pixsy takes 
      precautions against possible security breaches of the Site, 
      no web site or Internet transmission or connection is completely 
      secure. Consequently, Pixsy cannot guarantee that unauthorized 
      access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur, 
      and your use of the Site is at your own risk. Pixsy urges 
      you to keep your personally identifiable information safe 
      by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place, 
      separate from your account information, logging out of your 
      User Account, and closing your Web browser. Unless otherwise 
      specified herein or on the Site, credit card numbers are used 
      only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing 
      or any other purposes. Pixsy uses good faith efforts to employ 
      a security technology known as a secure-socket-layer to protect 
      the transmission of payment information to the Site. </div>
    <div class="text"><b>13. Processing Data in the United States.</b> 
      By providing any personal information to the Site, all users,
