                    Pixsy may disclose your personally identifiable information 
                    to third parties under the following circumstances: <b>(a)</b> 
                    we have been given your consent to disclose; <b>(b)</b> we 
                    have previously informed you of the disclosure; <b>(c)</b> 
                    we are required by law or court order to disclose or to comply

                    limitation in connection with a search warrant or demand for

                    or property, other Site users, or anyone else. Pixsy may also 
                    use IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet service 
                    provider to identify users if Pixsy deems it necessary to 
                    enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy or to protect 
                    our Site, Pixsy customers or others. You consent to the disclosure 
                    to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of the Site, 
                    of any and all information about you contained in the applicable 
                    Site database, if Pixsy assigns its rights and obligations

                    acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of Pixsy's

                    (including personally identifiable information) from time

                    precautions against possible security breaches of the Site, 
                    no web site or Internet transmission or connection is completely 
                    secure. Consequently, Pixsy cannot guarantee that unauthorized 
                    access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur, 
                    and your use of the Site is at your own risk. Pixsy urges 
                    you to keep your personally identifiable information safe 
                    by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place, 
                    separate from your account information, logging out of your 
                    User Account, and closing your Web browser. Unless otherwise 
                    specified herein or on the Site, credit card numbers are used 
                    only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing 
                    or any other purposes. Pixsy uses good faith efforts to employ 
                    a security technology known as a secure-socket-layer to protect 
                    the transmission of payment information to the Site. </div>
