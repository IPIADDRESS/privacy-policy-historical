<br>
<strong>Use and Treatment of Information</strong><br>
<br>
In accordance with the provisions of Law 15/1999, of 13 December (Data Protection -LOPD) and related complementary legislation, the Company informs the user that the information resulting from contracting the Product and Services and related personal data will be included in an automated File duly registered in the General Register of the Data Protection Spanish Agency for its automated processing. For this end, you as the user express consent to such treatment. <br>
The Company may use aggregate personal information (non-identifiable) to improve and adapt the service to the needs of the user. This statistical compilation of non-identifiable information may be used or provided to others for marketing purposes, advertising and research. The main goal of the Company in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with the most personalized experience possible. Information collected about you enables us to deliver content and advertising more relevant to you, and therefore a better service. Only the Company has access to the individual accounts. The Company may also do research on demographics, interests and behavior based on the information you provided during the registration process, on order forms, during a promotion, as well as information from our server log files or surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed in aggregate bases and the Company may share this aggregated data with advertisers, researchers and other businesses. From time to time, the Company may use your personal information to send you information about our products and services or other products and services that may be of interest to you. You can be removed from this mailing list by fulfilling the relevant Form provided on the website choosing the relevant option . The Company is the sole owner of information collected on the service. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in any way that varies from what we specified in this statement.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>
