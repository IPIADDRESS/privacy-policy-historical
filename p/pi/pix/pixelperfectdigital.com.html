                          Pixel Perfect Digital collects the visitor's IP address 
                          (e.g., whether the user is logged on from ibm.com or 
                          aol.com), referral data (e.g., the Internet address 
                          of the last Web page visited by a user before clicking 
                          over to our site), and browser and platform type (e.g., 
                          a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). Pixel Perfect 
                          Digital collects this user information for purposes 
                          of site monitoring and product improvement. We do use 
                          third-party advertising to serve ads on our site. These 
                          companies may use "cookies" to customize the 
                          advertising you see based on non-personally identifiable 
                          demographic information. This allows us to provide advertisements 
                          on this site about goods and services that may be of 
                          interest to you. </p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>Newsletter</strong><br>
                          We only email our subscribers Pixel Perfect Digital 
                          related news and information. We will never share, sell, 
                          or rent your email address to any 3rd party. You may

                          Guestbook</strong><br>
                          Our guestbook contains fields for you to add Name, email 
                          address, and homepage URL. The only place this information 
                          is recorded is in the guestbook. You should know that 
                          supplying your email address or web page URL on any 
                          web page makes that address available to anyone on the 
                          Internet. Pixel Perfect Digital takes no responsibility 
                          for any unsolicited email you may receive as a result 
                          of a 3rd party "harvesting" your email address 
                          or URL from our guestbook. The only way to prevent this 
                          from happening is to omit this information when you 
                          sign ( it isn't required to leave comments ).<br>

                          Digital is not responsible for the privacy practices

                          to be aware when they leave our site and to read the

                          If we change our privacy policy, we will post those 
                          changes on this page so our users are aware of what
