<p><strong>1. Collecting Personal Information from Website Visitors</strong><br><br>In order to provide you with access to certain services or data within our Sites, we may require that you provide certain personal information. This information may include your name, postal address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, subscriber name or screen name, password used to access our services, method of payment, and, if applicable, payment information, such as credit card number and expiration date associated with online purchases.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, we collect (1) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with us via e-mail, post messages to our bulletin boards or post messages to our chat groups, and (2) information provided by visitors in sales orders, registration forms, surveys, contest entries, and other submissions to us.<br><br>We also collect and track automatically (1) the home server domain names, IP addresses, type of client computer, and type of web browser of visitors to our Sites, and (2) aggregate and specific information on what pages visitors access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Collecting Other Information</strong><br><br>Pitney Bowes uses several automatic data collection tools and techniques including cookies, clickstream, and web beacons.<br><br>Cookies&nbsp;<br>Some of our Sites use a technology called "cookies" so that we can better serve visitors when they purchase a product on our Sites, request additional information about our company, products or services, or participate in various activities posted<br><br>on our Sites. A cookie is a bit of text that is placed on a user's computer hard drive when certain websites are visited. These cookies may be placed by us or by third party vendors and are used to obtain data such as user-name, shopping cart contents, and web pages or advertisements viewed by the visitor. When the visitor revisits our Sites, we can recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor's experience accordingly.&nbsp;<br><br>You can set your browser to provide notice whenever a cookie is received, which gives you the opportunity to decide whether to accept it or not.&nbsp; Without cookies, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our Site features. For example, if you turn off cookies or refuse them, you will not be able to make purchases on our Sites.&nbsp;<br><br>Clickstream<br>Certain of our Sites may collect information about the "clickstream" of our customers during their visit to our Sites. This clickstream data contains the pages the visitors came from, the navigational paths they took, and the areas of the Sites they visited.&nbsp;<br><br>From time to time, we track such information inside and outside of our Sites.&nbsp; Additionally, we may from time to time track and match clickstream data with personal information you provide to us in order to deliver content and other offerings - i.e., products and services that might improve your customer experience.&nbsp;<br><br>Web Beacon<br>Certain email communications you may receive from us may contain "web beacons." &nbsp; Web beacons consist of a line of code on our Sites that delivers a small graphic image from another website or third-party ad server. The web beacon may not be visible as it is generally a 1x1 pixel that is often designed to blend into the background of a web page. Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page and the information in cookies set by the third party.&nbsp; We may use web beacons for activities such as monitoring the effectiveness of ad banners in our email distributions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br><br><strong>3. Using Personal Information</strong><br><br>Personal information we collect through our Sites will be used to, among other things, fulfill orders and requests for information, for marketing and promoting products and services of Pitney Bowes and other entities that we believe you may find of interest, for feedback purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product development or enhancement, for content improvement, to notify you of upcoming events and to customize content and layout of our Sites. Names, postal and e-mail addresses, and phone numbers collected through our Sites may be used to contact you regarding products and services and upcoming events we believe you might find of interest.&nbsp;<br><br>We also may use the personal information you provide for Pitney Bowes internal purposes, such as administration and operation of our Sites, data analytics, and compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures.</p>
