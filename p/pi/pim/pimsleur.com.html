<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>SimonSays.com ("Site," "us,"or "we") is maintained by Simon &amp; Schuster Digital, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY, 10020, and is a member of the Simon &amp; Schuster family of companies. We can be reached by e-mail at <a class="" href="mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com">privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com</a>.</p>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. Because we gather certain types of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") from users of our Site and for various Simon &amp; Schuster activities, operational and business purposes, we feel you should know how we collect, use, disclose, manage, and store the Personal Information that you may provide to us. This Privacy Policy is a part of the Site's <a class="" href="http://www.simonsays.com/content/feature.cfm?sid=33&amp;feature_id=1630">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, which is binding on all Site users. This Policy applies only to the Personal Information collected by Simon &amp; Schuster and does not cover any such information collected by its corporate parent(s), affiliates, or any other company, unless specifically stated. </p>
<p>If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in Simon &amp; Schuster's online or off-line activities and services that require you to provide your Personal Information. (The type of Personal Information collected is listed below. See Section entitled WEBSITE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION) This Policy provides information regarding your choices to Opt-out when your Personal Information is used for various promotional and marketing purposes by Simon &amp; Schuster, the Site, its corporate affiliates, and/or unaffiliated third party. For example, for Simon &amp; Schuster, the Site or our corporate affiliates' use of your Personal Information for marketing and promotional purposes, we provide you with the right to Opt-out. You may opt-out by following the opt-out instructions in the footer of any e-mail you receive or if applicable by clicking the Opt-Out boxes that may be included on the registration area for the particular activity at issue. Alternatively, you may opt-out by notifying the Site's Privacy Administrator at <a class="" href="mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com">privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong><br>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong><br>Residents of the State of California, under a new provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. Simon &amp; Schuster qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may Opt-out or Opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (e-mail or postal mail). You may contact us in two ways. Send e-mail to Privacy Administrator at <a class="" href="mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com">privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com</a>. </p>
<p>Alternatively, you may contact Simon &amp; Schuster at:<br>Simon &amp; Schuster Digital<br>1230 Avenue of the Americas, 11th Floor<br>New York, NY 10020<br>Attn: Your California Privacy Rights c/o Privacy Administrator</p>
<p>For requests sent via e-mail, you must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the subject field of your e-mail. All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request. For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. (Your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via e-mail. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping.) <strong>We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile.</strong> We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information. </p>
<p>To all other users of this Site, if you have other questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact our Privacy Administrator at the following e-mail address: <a class="" href="mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com">privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong><br>SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>In connection with your purchases at SimonSays.com, we use a third party operational service provider to collect your credit card [or debit card] number. The third party operational service provider conducts the financial transaction in a secured manner by collecting your payment information through a secured Internet connection via SSL. The third party payment mechanism will be accessible via a hyperlink from the Site and the third party operational service provider will be solely responsible for all financial transactions and the collection, use, and storage of your credit card [or debit card] information. In connection with your purchases, the Site may request additional Personal Information such as full name, billing and shipping address, e-mail address and telephone number and any such information that is required to fulfill your order and to communicate with you regarding your order. We may use your Personal Information, (but not your credit card or debit card number) to contact you about future products, services and discounts from Simon &amp; Schuster or to provide such information indirectly from third parties such as promotional partners, unless you tell us otherwise ("Opt-out"). We will only use your credit card [and debit card] number to complete the specific transaction you requested. </p>
<p>Please remember that no data transmission over the Internet, or by other means, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your personal data, Simon &amp; Schuster cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. As noted above, our third party operational service provider uses a secured connection for the collection of payment information, but we do not use a secured connection for other types of activities. Therefore, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that you transmit certain Personal Information over this Site at your own risk. </p>
<p>Once we receive your data, we use reasonable efforts to ensure the information you provide is secure and not readily available to unauthorized individuals or third parties.</p>
<p><br><strong>LINKS</strong><br>We are not responsible for the data collection practices of any sites linked to SimonSays.com nor does our linking to third party websites or services constitute sponsorship or endorsement of the content or business practices on these sites. When visiting linked sites, you should refer to each such site's individual privacy policy. By use of this Site, you have agreed that you will use the hyperlinks to third party sites at your own risk.</p>
<p><br><strong>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong><br>Visitors to this Site may participate in many activities without providing any Personal Information. However, certain activities or features may require the submission of Personal Information from children and in these circumstances, we will follow the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). We will use Personal Information that children provide to respond to their requests, e.g., to provide them with our newsletters, to participate in a game, sweepstakes or contest, or to respond to their requests about our books or products. We will not condition children's participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. We do not share children's information with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy, or otherwise inconsistent with the requirements of COPPA. If you are a Parent or Legal Guardian and would like to review any Personal Information that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's information or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact us at:<br><br>Simon &amp; Schuster Digital<br>1230 Avenue of the Americas, 11th Floor <br>New York, New York, 10020 <br>ATTN: Privacy Administrator <br>(212) 698-7148<br><br>or via email: <a class="" href="mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com">privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com</a> </p>
<p>For activities or features that are not targeted to children and have specific age eligibility requirements, we will automatically reject or delete the registration or entry of any person we believe in good faith to be underage and ineligible for an activity reserved for users 13 or older. Any false or fraudulent registration or entry from an ineligible person will be deemed to be ineligible and will disqualify the minor from the receipt of a prize, benefit, or other participation.</p>
<p><br><strong>OPT-OUT OPTIONS SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL E-MAILS</strong><br>You can "opt-out" of receiving advertising and promotional e-mail from us in compliance with federal law by following the opt-out instructions in our e-mail messages. To ensure that your opt-out request is honored, you must use the designated method in the e-mail message to notify us of your opt-out request, as we cannot guarantee that other methods of notification will be effective or timely. We will continue to send you important service-related communications (e.g., order confirmation or product safety information). Please note that even if you chose to opt-out of Simon &amp; Schuster's marketing, we will continue to send you important service related communications, including follow-up messages regarding sweepstakes or contests you have entered or other transactions you have undertaken (e.g., order confirmation).</p>
<p><br><strong>DATA SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES</strong><br>We do not currently share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. However, depending on the activity, we may in the future do so and you will receive notice on the Site and/or in the rules of participation ("Rules of Participation") for the event or activity, or via an e-mail notice. Please be informed that unaffiliated third parties may not have the same privacy policies that we do. Therefore, you will need to tell us if you do not want to receive marketing information directly from third parties. You will need to check the "Opt-out" click boxes that may be included on the registration area for the particular event, in an e-mail, or alternatively, notify the Site's Privacy Administrator at <a class="" href="mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com">privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com</a>.</p>

We will take such measures if we believe it is necessary to protect the security, integrity, and operations of this Site or Simon &amp; Schuster. Without disclosure of Personal Information about individual users, we may provide aggregate statistics about our users, traffic patterns and related Site information to reputable third party vendors or marketing companies.</p>

<p>Except for contests &amp; sweepstakes entries, rebate request forms or other special features/events registrations, we do not ordinarily use your Personal Information collected off-line for promotional and marketing purposes, nor do we share it with unaffiliated or unassociated third parties for promotional or marketing purposes. If Personal Information collected off-line will be used by Simon &amp; Schuster, its parent company, corporate affiliates, or for promotional and marketing purposes, in most cases you will have the opportunity to Opt-out of such use. For certain promotions and activities, you may have an opportunity to Opt-in to our use of your Personal Information for promotional purposes; such rights will be provided to you in writing at that time. </p>
