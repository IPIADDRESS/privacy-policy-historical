	Internetorderllc.com and pimsleurapproach.com (the "Websites") are Internet properties of Internet Order LLC ("us" or "we"). Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy is designed to inform you of what information Internet Order LLC collects, why we collect such information and how we use the information we collect (this "Privacy Policy). If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at <a href="https://server.iad.liveperson.net/hc/s-61627811/web/ticketpub/msgcontroller.jsp">customercare@pimsleurapproach.com</a>.

Additional information about consumer use of the Internet is available via the Federal Trade Commission and at its website, www.ftc.gov.
	<p></p>
	<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
	In general, you can browse our Web Site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") about yourself. We collect PII from this Website when you purchase a Product or otherwise choose to provide PII to us. PII is any information that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity. This includes, but is not limited to: full name, home, billing and physical address, telephone number, mobile number, email address or other contact information, credit card number and expiration date. When you submit your PII to us, you are giving us your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your PII as set forth in this Privacy Policy. For example, you may choose to send us PII about yourself in an email or by completing an online form on our Website. Once collected, we will store your PII for a reasonable period of time for record keeping purposes. The information that we store is sometimes deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business.

	<p></p>
	<strong>Information Sharing </strong><br>
	Internet Order LLC will not sell, share, trade or rent your PII to or with others, unless you have granted us permission to do so.

	<p></p>
	<strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong><br>
	We use "cookies" and web beacons to help us manage our Website. Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters. Web beacons (also known as "1X1 pixels" or "clear GIFs") are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. Web users have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in their browser. Web users can check their browser supplier's website for details on how to do this. Declining the use of cookies may render inoperable certain features of the Website. Where authorized by us, third parties may use cookies, Internet Order LLC's web log files, web beacons and other monitoring technologies to compile aggregate statistics on Internet Order LLC's behalf. The non-personal information that we collect is used to understand better and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of our Website and marketing programs. We may share or transfer Non-PII with or to our affiliates, licensees and partners. We use cookies on certain pages of our Website in order, among other things, to analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, deliver to you a more customized shopping experience, track visits from our affiliates and partners and allow the use of our shopping cart. Internet Order LLC does not use cookies to store or collect any PII. Internet Order LLC web pages may also contain electronic images know as Web beacons. These Web beacons allow Internet Order LLC to count users who have visited certain Web pages or to deliver co-branded services. Additionally, Internet Order LLC may use third-party advertising or content delivery companies to serve ads or images on our Website or on other websites on the World Wide Web. These companies may use web beacons to place a cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the third party to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and to compile anonymous information.

	<p></p>
	<strong>Third Party Websites</strong><br>
	This Website may contain links to and advertisements for websites operated by third parties whose privacy practices may differ from those of Internet Order LLC. While we endeavor to associate only with reputable entities, Internet Order LLC cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of third party websites. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of all websites that you visit. 
	<p></p>
	<strong>Minors</strong><br>
	This Website is not intended for visitors who are under eighteen (18) years of age. Internet Order LLC does not knowingly solicit or collect information from individuals under the age of eighteen (18). If we determine that we have inadvertently collected PII from someone under eighteen (18), we will take reasonable steps to purge this information from our database. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the Internet activities of their children.
	<p></p>
	<strong>Security</strong><br>
	All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect PII (including Sensitive Information) off-line. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect our end users' PII, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
	<p></p>
	Once we receive the transmission of your PII, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. Access to this information is strictly limited and not accessible to the public. All our end users' PII is restricted in our offices. Only personnel who need the information to perform a specific job (for example a customer service representative) are granted access to PII. Personnel not adhering to our policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state law, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your PII. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and engage in remedial measures. 
	<p></p>
	Changes to this Privacy Policy and Notification of Changes:<br>
	Internet Order LLC reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a clear and conspicuous notice on the Website explaining that we are changing our Privacy Policy. All Privacy Policy changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on the Website. Please check the Website periodically for any changes.
