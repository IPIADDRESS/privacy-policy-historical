                <h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
                <p>We use "cookies" and web beacons to help us manage our Website. Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters. Web beacons (also known as "1X1 pixels" or "clear GIFs") are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. Web users have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in their browser. Web users can check their browser supplier's website for details on how to do this.

                <h2>Third Party Websites</h2>
                <p>This Website may contain links to and advertisements for websites operated by third parties whose privacy practices may differ from those of Internet Order LLC.

                <h2>Minors</h2>
                <p>This Website is not intended for visitors who are under eighteen (18) years of age.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect PII (including Sensitive Information) off-line. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect our end users' PII, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. </p>

Access to this information is strictly limited and not accessible to the public. All our end users' PII is restricted in our offices.

Personnel not adhering to our policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state law, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your PII. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and engage in remedial measures.</p>
