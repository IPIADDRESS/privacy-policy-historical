      Welcome to Pimp My Search, a Fun Novelty site where you can create your own 
      Personalized search engine. We take your privacy very seriously. To 
      make it easier for you to read and understand our privacy policy, we did 
      the unconventional thing - we wrote this in plain English and tried to 
      keep it to a reasonably short length.<br>
