      <br>
      Welcome to PimpMySearch, a Fun Novelty site where you can create your own 
      Personalized search engine &amp; share it with your Friends!. We take your privacy very seriously. To 
      make it easier for you to read and understand our privacy policy, we did 
      the unconventional thing - we wrote this in plain English and tried to 
      keep it to a reasonably short length.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Information Collected&nbsp; &amp; Usage</b><br>
      When you use PimpMySearch, you may submit personally identifiable 
      information such as your name and email address. We also collect other 
      non-personally identifiable data, which may include your IP address, browser 
      type etc. We use the personally identifiable information (Name, Email) you 
      submit only in your friend invites. We also use your non-personally 
      identifiable data information to measure our website traffic and 
      performance. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Email Policies</b><br>
      We hate spam like you do. That's why our policy is <u>not to send any 
      email</u> except for the user initiated invite emails. Also we send the 
      invites only once and don't send any more remainder emails!. </p>
      <p>All our user-initiated invite emails are clearly marked as such and 
      also feature an <a href="http://invite.pimpmysearch.com/i/stopinvites.php">
      unsubscribe link</a> and postal address in accordance with the CAN-SPAM act.
</p>
      <p>
      <b>Inviting Friends</b><br>
      Inviting friends to PimpMySearch.com is <u>always completely optional</u>. 
      When you choose to <a href="#" onclick="on_click_invite(this); return false;">invite friends</a>, 
      we will send an email (only once) to the addresses you selected, indicating that it is a message from you. 
      Also we will share your name and email address with your invitee so that they know 
      who the invitation is coming from. <br>
      <br>
      When you choose to invite, we will access your web address book using the login details 
      that you provide. We access your address book only once to retrieve your 
      friends information so that you may select whom to invite. We do not store 
      your login details nor do we use them for any other purpose then to 
      retrieve your contacts. We never send invitations to contacts you do not 
      explicitly select and your invitations are the only email we will ever 
      send to your friends. Also we don't send any more remainder emails other 
      than the initial invite!. </p>
      <p>
      If you do not wish to receive invitations from your friends you can
      <a href="http://invite.pimpmysearch.com/i/stopinvites.php">unsubscribe</a> 
      at any time.<br>
      <br>
