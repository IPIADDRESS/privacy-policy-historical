<p>This Privacy Policy does not cover the activities of third parties that we do not own or control but that may be linked to or accessible via our Sites (“<strong>Third Party Services</strong>”).&nbsp; Some examples of Third Party Services are when you log into Facebook, Google+ and Twitter while using or visiting the Sites. Third Party Services will have their own privacy policies that govern your use of their sites, services, or applications.&nbsp; We are not responsible for your use of Third Party Services, or for the content or policies of Third Party Services.

A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an email or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet, enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message.&nbsp; A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including your Personally Identifiable Information.</li>

<p><strong>California &amp; Canadian Users: Your California Privacy Rights.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personally identifiable information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; Alternatively, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personally identifiable information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information sharing.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy explain our practices and how you can opt-out of having your information shared with third parties for the third parties’ direct or indirect marketing purposes.&nbsp;</p>
