In the event a competent governmental authority asks Pingo to retain and provide Personal Information about a Customer, Pingo reserves the right to provide any and all assistance and information necessary in its opinion to fulfill the request.</p> <p>We also may disclose Personal Information in connection with a merger, acquisition or bankruptcy.  If We should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if We should decide to buy another business, or sell or reorganize part or all of our business, We may be required to disclose your Personal Information to prospective or actual purchasers and other parties.    By agreeing to this Privacy Statement, you agree to any such transfer of your Personal Information that may occur.   It is Pingo's practice to obtain appropriate protections for Personal Information disclosed in these types of transactions.  Pingo cannot, however, guarantee that Our Privacy Statement will remain unchanged if Pingo is sold or merges with or is acquired by another company.</p> <p><b><u>Retention of Personal Information</u></b></p> <p>Personal Information will be retained as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.</p> <p><b><u>Consent and Opt-Out Rights</u></b></p> <p>By accepting this Privacy Statement, registering on the Website, or using Pingo's services, You consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Statement.  You may withdraw your consent in writing at any time subject to applicable legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:customerservice@pingo.com" class="links">customerservice@pingo.com</a>.  Pingo will inform you of the implications of such withdrawal, however, withdrawal of consent may make it impossible for Us to continue providing services to You.  Pingo also allows Customers to opt out of receiving marketing communications from Us,  Our affiliates or third parties  during registration and any time thereafter by sending an e-mail request  to <a href="mailto:customerservice@pingo.com" class="links">customerservice@pingo.com</a> or by following the unsubscribe procedures in any email marketing communication.</p> <p>Even if You  opt out of receiving marketing communications, You will still receive e-mail communications from Us regarding your Pingo account and services to which You have subscribed, including, but not limited to, communications regarding service issues.  Pingo also reserves the right to use e-mail to notify You regarding any claims related to  your use of Pingo services, including without limitation claims of violations of a third party's rights.  You may permanently close your Pingo account and stop all communication by sending a request to <a href="mailto:customerservice@pingo.com" class="links">customerservice@pingo.com</a>.</p> <p><b><u>Protection of Your Personal Information</u></b></p> <p>Pingo takes reasonable precautions to protect Personal Information.  We have invested in and deployed technological and physical security measures to protect the Personal Information and other information that we collect.  For instance, the when Our registration form asks You to enter Personal Information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software most commonly deployed in the ecommerce industry, Secured Socket Layer ("SSL").  If you use an SSL-enabled Internet browser, such as used in the current versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, your transmissions of Personal Information to Us through them will be secured through SSL technology.  You can verify whether the information that is transmitted is using SSL encryption by confirming the presence of a "closed lock" (for users of Microsoft Internet Explorer) or a "solid key" (for users of Netscape Navigator) symbol on the bottom bar of your browser window.  To learn more about SSL, follow this link to <a href="http://www.verisign.com/site/ssl.html" target="new" class="links">http://www.verisign.com/site/ssl.html</a>.</p> <p>In addition, We maintain firewalls and other technical security measures for our servers and internal networks, and the servers on which Personal Information is stored are located in secure facilities that are available only to authorized personnel.  Our employees are dedicated to maintaining and upholding your privacy and security and are educated regarding this Privacy Policy.  Only those employees who require Personal Information to perform a specific function related to the Pingo service are granted access to that information.  Our employees are required to use the utmost discretion when accessing Personal Information, and they are prohibited from using Personal Information for purposes unrelated to their job functions.  As appropriate, our employees are notified when this Privacy Policy is revised or other privacy or security measures are implemented by Pingo.</p> <p>Pingo makes no representations or warranties with regard to the sufficiency of these security measures.  By accepting this Privacy Policy or using Pingo's services, You agree that Pingo shall not be responsible for any actual, indirect, or consequential damages (or any other damages or liability of any kind whatsoever, whether as a result of negligence or otherwise) that may result from our non-compliance with this Privacy Statement.</p> <p><b><u>Accuracy of Personal Information and Customer Access to Personal Information</u></b></p> <p>Pingo takes reasonable steps to make sure that the Personal Information You provide is accurate, complete and up-to-date for the purposes for which it is collected and processed.  Upon written request to <a href="mailto:customerservice@pingo.com" class="links">customerservice@pingo.com</a> or via a password-protected profile available on the Website, You can learn whether Pingo holds Personal Information about You.  However, any information collected in connection with, or in anticipation of, any claim or legal proceeding will not be made available to you.  You will not be charged for making this request.  If you notify Us that any Personal Information that We have is incorrect, We will review such information.  If we agree that the Personal Information is incorrect, we will correct our records.  We may charge You a reasonable fee to make corrections.  If We do not agree that your Personal Information is incorrect, You may submit a short statement of dispute, which we will include in any future disclosure of disputed information.   Pingo may refuse to correct, amend, or delete any Personal Information that We require to provide service to You or that we are required or permitted to retain by applicable law.</p> <p><b><u>Transfer of Data</u></b></p> <p>The Personal Information that We collect may be stored and processed on servers located in various countries, including servers located outside of your home country.  The laws of other countries may not provide the same degree of protection for your Personal Information as your home country.  By accepting this Privacy Statement, registering on the Website, or using Pingo services, You expressly acknowledge and consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to countries outside your home country, including to the United States.  If You do not agree to the transfer of your Personal Information as provided in this Privacy Statement, We may not be able to provide service to You.</p> <p><b><u>Links to Outside Websites</u></b></p> <p>The Website may contain links that will let Customers leave the Website and access other websites.  Linked websites are not under Our control.  It is possible that these websites have privacy policies and standards that are different than those of Pingo.  This Privacy Statement applies only to Personal Information that is acquired by Us on the Website.  Pingo accepts no responsibility or liability for our Customers' use of other websites.</p> <p><b><u>Refer-A-Friend</u></b></p> <p>Pingo's Refer-A-Friend function on the Website allows You to recommend Pingo to your friends and family.  To do so, You must provide the e-mail addresses of the persons You are referring. By providing the e-mail addresses, You are giving us permission to send an e-mail invitation in your name.  Friends will be eligible to receive an e-mail invitation if they are not current or former Customers and they have not already been told about Pingo by another Customer through the Refer-A-Friend service.  Information  entered by You for Refer-A-Friend will be used only for the purposes of generating e-mail messages to these potential Pingo Customers.</p> <p>Refer-A-Friend is intended to be used only by our Customers to tell their friends and family about Pingo's service.  Pingo does not condone spamming.  Spamming includes, but is not limited to, providing Pingo with the e-mail addresses of people who are not known to You and entering e-mail addresses that are found on a mass mailing list.</p> <p>If We determine that a Customer is improperly using Refer-A-Friend, We may, in our sole discretion, block the Customer from using the Website or cancel Customer's service, in addition to any other remedies permitted by applicable law.</p> <p>Pingo is not liable for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages due to the use of the Refer-A-Friend service. </p> <p><b><u>Children's Privacy Protection</u></b></p> <p>Children under 13 years of age are not permitted to be Pingo Customers.  Children under 13 should not send Us any information about themselves.  If a child under 13 submits information through any part of Our Website, and We become aware that the person submitting the information is a child, We will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible.  Because We do not knowingly collect any personal information about children under 13, We do not knowingly use or disclose such information.</p> <p><b><u>Changes to This Privacy Statement</u></b></p> <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Statement at any time without notice.  The revised Privacy Statement will be effective immediately upon its posting on the Website.  By accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement, You agree that your continued use of Pingo's services after a revised Privacy Statement is posted on the Website constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Statement.</p> <p><b><u>Our Privacy Officer</u></b></p> <p>We have designated one or more individuals who monitor Our compliance with this Privacy Statement.  The individual responsible for Our compliance has been designated as Pingo's Privacy Officer and can be reached at <a href="mailto:privacy@pingo.com" class="links">privacy@pingo.com</a>.  Other individuals may handle the day-to-day collection and processing of Personal Information.  The Privacy Officer or Pingo's management may designate other individuals within Pingo to assist the Privacy Officer or to perform the Privacy Officer's responsibilities.</p> <p><b><u>Questioning Pingo's Compliance With This Privacy Statement</u></b></p> <p>If You believe that We have not complied with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, You may send an e-mail to Our Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@pingo.com" class="links">privacy@pingo.com</a>.  Pingo will investigate all such inquiries and will respond to You as appropriate.  We may seek advice from internal and external advisors before providing responding to your inquiry.</p> <p>If We determine that a Customer complaint is justified, We will take appropriate remedial measures, in Our sole discretion, including modifying Our policies and practices.</p> <p><b><u>Contact Us</u></b></p> <p>If You have any questions regarding this Privacy Statement, please contact Us at:</p> <p>Pingo Customer Service <br> 20 Second Avenue <br> Burlington, MA 01803, USA <br> <a href="mailto:customerservice@pingo.com" class="links">customerservice@pingo.com</a> <br> U.S. Toll Free: 1-888-878-8838</p> <p><b><u>Effective Date</u></b></p> <p>This Privacy Statement is effective as of September 6<sup>th</sup>, 2006.</p>
