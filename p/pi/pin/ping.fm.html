												<div class="clearboth"></div><div class="otips">
  <b>First and foremost:</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  Any data you share with Ping.fm will be used only for the service we provide.  We don't
  share your personal information with anyone and no other websites have access to our
  databases.  We've ensured even higher security with top of the line SSL encryption.
  <br>
  <br>
  If you ever have any questions regarding your information or the reliability of our
  security measures, don't hesitate to contact us about it.
</div>
<br>
<strong>Your privacy is important to us.</strong>
<br>
<br>
Safeguarding your privacy and the security of your personal information is
important to us. Please take a few minutes to read the following policy so that
you understand how we treat your personal information. As we continuously improve
and expand our services, this policy might change. So please check it out
periodically. If you have questions about our policy, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.
<br>
<br>
We collect information in three ways:
<ol>
  <li>We collect information that our users supply to us.</li>
  <li>
    We collect information from emails and other contacts sent to us by our
    users and users of our website.
  </li>
  <li>
    We collect information electronically on all users of our website, including
    users, by means of cookies.
  </li>
</ol>
Further details are provided below.
<br>
<br>
<strong>What personal information we collect from our users.</strong>
<br>
<br>
When you set up an account at Ping.fm to use our service, you are required
to provide us your e-mail address only. You must also choose your password and
provide it to us.
<br>
<br>
Additional information collected is for the website profiles, or the actual
website that your content will be delivered.  This consists of website url,
and the path location to your delivery script.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Our use of cookies.</strong>
<br>
<br>
Like many websites on the Internet, our website uses cookies. Cookies are small
strings of data placed on a user's personal computer hard drive during the
exchange of data that happens when your browser points to our website. Cookies
enable a website to identify a user's browser as a previous visitor by means of
a unique string of numbers assigned on a previous visit. Our cookies assist us
in collecting information on what pages of our website you access or visit, and
in recording any preferences you indicate on our website. We also use cookies to
make your experience on Ping.fm more personalized, and convenient.
<br>
<br>
Our cookies cannot and do not retrieve any other data from your hard drive or
pass on computer viruses. If you are just browsing our website, a cookie
identifies your browser and e-mail address, not your identity.
<br>
<br>
<strong>How we store the information we collect.</strong>
<br>
<br>
We store the information you provide to us and the information we collect
electronically in our computer databases. We own, maintain and operate our
computer servers containing our databases. Access to our computer servers is
controlled by strict network security.
<br>
<br>
<strong>How we use the information we collect.</strong>
<br>
<br>
We do not sell your personal information, or any information that can be
identified to you personally, to any third-party marketers or other third
parties. We do aggregate information about how our service is used (without
specific identification to any particular user) to be able to improve our
service and make it more responsive to our users' preferences.
<br>
<br>
You can control how information about you is used. You can also limit our
communications directly to you. If you have a Ping.fm account and do not want
to receive emails telling you about our other services in the future, please let
us know.
<br>
<br>
Ping.fm may from time to time send nonpromotional email to all registered
users for the purpose of gathering and dispersing data to provide better
services to our users. Registered users will be under no obligation to reply or
answer questions in said nonpromotional email. Nonpromotional email will include,
but will not be limited to, surveys, maintenance notices and system updates.
<br>
<br>
<b>Our policies may change.</b>
<br>
<br>
This is our current privacy and security policy, but we reserve the right to
change our website and this policy at any time. You should check this privacy
policy periodically. If our policies regarding collection, storage and use of
your information change, the information collected under prior policies will
continue to be governed by those policies, unless we obtain your consent to
use that information in new ways.
<br>
<br>
<b>You can access your information.</b>
<br>
<br>
Upon your request, we will provide you with access to your unique
account-related information and information from contacts that we maintain
about you. In your request, please provide us with your current specific
contact information so that we can accurately check our records.
<br>
<br>
<b>How is my information protected?</b>
<br>
<br>
Your information is password-protected. In order to maintain this protection,
we caution you not to provide your password to anyone. We do not give your
password to anyone. We recommend that, if you share your computer with other
people, you close your browser window when your session is completed. Logging out
will protect your information if you share a computer with someone else or are
using a computer in a public place like a library.
<br>
<br>
Please contact us with any questions or comments.
<br>
<br>
We want you to enjoy your use of Ping.fm's service. If you have any
questions, or believe that a violation of this policy may have occurred,
please let us know by using our <a href="/contact/">contacting us</a>.
