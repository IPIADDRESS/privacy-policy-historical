<h3>HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our
Terms of Use www.pinfluencer.com/terms.</p>
<p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong> We ask for certain information such as your email
address and Pinterest board URL when you register for a Pinfluencer account. We may
also collect any information you choose to provide if you correspond with us. We may
also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you
provide in User Content you post to the Service. If you choose to sign up for a premium
account, any payment information you provide will be collected and stored by our third
party payment processor. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to
you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Information we may receive from third parties:</strong> We may receive information about
you from third parties. For example, if you connect your User account to a third-party
connection or log-in, for example, by linking your Facebook or Twitter account to the
Pinfluencer Service, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its
service to Pinfluencer. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user
ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token
necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third
party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with
that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on
third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Pinfluencer
Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting
your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will
remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong> We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party
analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools
collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit
and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this
analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated
to identify any particular individual user.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies information:</strong> When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies —
a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that
uniquely identifies your browser and lets Pinfluencer help you log in faster and enhance
your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about
how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions
you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of
the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close
your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to
the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions.
A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can
reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept
cookies is disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser
or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our
servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include
anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact
with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such
information.</p>
<p><strong>Clear gifs/web beacons information:</strong> When you use the Service, we may employ clear
gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage
patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent
to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.
The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial and marketing communications:</strong> We use the information we collect
or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing
newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email
messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also
use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification,
purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the
Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Use of certain service type information we collect about you:</strong> We use or may use
cookies, log file, and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you
will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b)
provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the
effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of
visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems;

protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the
U.S. or any other country in which Pinfluencer or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service
providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in
this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping your information safe:</strong> Pinfluencer cares about the security of your information,
and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all
