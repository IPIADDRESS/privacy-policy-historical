		maintaining the privacy of our customers. This Privacy Policy explains
		our practices with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of

		our privacy practices and the terms and conditions of
		PinkVisualGames.com. If this policy is not agreeable to you, please do
		not use PinkVisualGames.com.</p>

	<h2>What type of information is collected?</h2>
	<p>We only collect personal information from visitors to and customers
		of PinkVisualGames.com that is voluntarily supplied to us by
		completing our signup form, or by way of electing to use one or more
		of the services provided on PinkVisualGames.com. We may require
		visitors to provide us with information including, but not limited to,
		their name, physical address, email address, birth date, username,
		password, and on occasion, some other manner of unique identifier.</p>

	<h2>In what way do we use your personal and non-personal information?</h2>
	<p>When visitors access PinkVisualGames.com, certain non-personal
		information may be collected from them including, but not limited to,
		their browser type (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox),
		operating system (e.g., Windows, iOS), IP address, and the domain name
		from which they accessed the site (e.g., google.com). In addition, we
		may collect information about visitors' browsing behavior, such as the
		date and time they visit the PinkVisualGames.com, the areas or pages
		of our PinkVisualGames.com that they visit, the amount of time spent
		viewing PinkVisualGames.com, the number of times the visitor returns
		to PinkVisualGames.com, and click-stream data.</p>
	<p>We use proprietary javascript as well as third-party scripts like
		Google Analytics to determine the number of PinkVisualGames.com
		visitors that have been sent to us through our affiliate network. We
		do not track any information about visitors once they leave
		PinkVisualGames.com. We may use cookies (small text files that are
		stored on visitors' computers when they access our Web site) to
		collect this information. Information collected through cookies may be
		combined with visitors' personal information. We may also allow
		unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to
		visitors of our Web site. Visitors are always free to decline cookies,
		but in doing so they may not be able to use certain features on our
		Web site. The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains
		how to configure a browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the
		browser inform a user when it receives a new cookie, and how to erase
		cookies from your hard drive(s).</p>
	<p>We may use information collected from visitors to our Web site for
		any of the following purposes: (1) to send visitors information and
		promotional materials about our company, (2) to send visitors
		information and promotional materials from our marketing partners and
		third parties (such as advertisers on our Web site), (3) to deliver
		targeted display advertisements by matching criteria provided by our
		advertisers with information collected from our visitors, (4) to
		contact visitors to our Web site when necessary, (5) to allow
		convenient, easily affected purchases or access to proprietary content
		by pre-populating fields, within registration or other transaction
		screens, with a visitor's name, billing address, and email (among
		other things), as provided by that visitor, (6) to help diagnose
		problems with our server, (7) to administer our Web site, (8) to
		conduct internal reviews of our site (e.g., to determine the number of
		visitors to the site), (9) to help us better understand visitors' use
		of our site, and (10) to protect the security or integrity of our
		site. Non-personal information will be used for purposes of conducting
		internal reviews of the site, monitoring the site, and providing a
		greater online experience for our visitors.</p>

	<h2>What security measures do we take to protect your information?</h2>

		ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place
		certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard
		and secure the information we collect from visitors to
		PinkVisualGames.com. We allow access to personal information only to
		persons and entities engaging in activities provided for by this
		Privacy Policy. Visitors should consider any communication that they
		transmit to us (such as data, questions or answers, comments,
		suggestions, or communications submitted to a chat room) to be
		non-confidential. We will not be liable or responsible if information
		that belongs to a visitor is intercepted and used by an unintended
		recipient.</p>

	<h2>Corporate changes.</h2>
	<p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset or stock sale,
		bankruptcy, or other asset transfer (regardless of legal formality),
		any of our assets may be transferred to a third party, including
		personal information collected from visitors to our Web site.</p>
