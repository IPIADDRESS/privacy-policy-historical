<b id="commitment">A. OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT</b><br><br>
<b>We protect the identities of our participants. We will NOT use your personal identifying information (or those of members of your household) to advertise, promote, or sell goods or services directly to you or members of your household; and we do not allow our clients to market directly to you.</b><br><br>

<b id="collect">B. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b><br>
<ul class="list-disc">
    <li><b id="device">Information you give us.</b> During the recruitment process, the panel registration process, or as part of a research study or survey, you provide us with information. This may include: <br><br>
        <ul class="list-circle">
            <li><b>Personal identifying information</b>, which means information by itself – like your first and last name, home postal address or personal email address – or in combination with other information, that could identify a specific individual.</li>
            <li>Demographic information such as gender, marital status, occupation and other information.</li>
            <li>Information in connection with your participation in surveys and/or studies. These surveys request additional information such as your behaviors and preferences and help us better understand consumer behavior, use, and trends. “Behavior data” is when, why or how you do things such as how frequently you shop for groceries, use your computer, TV or the Internet. “Preference data” means the choices you make such as which breakfast cereals you buy, which stations to listen to or watch, or websites you visit.</li>
            <li>Any content or material you choose to submit, upload or transmit, including without limitation, photos, videos, images, or the likeness of the individual submitting the content in connection with your participation in market research activities.</li>
            <li>You may be offered the opportunity to participate in market research activities through a third party service such as Facebook or Twitter. If you select such option, we may collect certain profile information stored in your social media platform account.</li>
            <li>In addition to the above mentioned information, through certain surveys or studies, you may be asked to voluntarily provide or disclose Sensitive Information. “Sensitive information” means personal identifying information that discloses or reveals health or medical conditions, biometric or genetic data, sexual orientation or sexual life, political opinions/views, race/ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs and trade-union membership.</li>
            <li>Through your use of our software or hardware, we will also receive data you provide or enable through the application, such as when you voluntarily provide us with access to the location of your device, enable push notifications, and activate hardware functions like your camera or microphone to upload photos, recordings and videos.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li><b>Information from your use of our software and Site.</b> When you use our Site or any of our software, we may collect information about your device, system and network. This includes information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the type of browser you are using, the date and time of your visit, the web page you have visited immediately prior to visiting this Site, device identifier, device model, operating system, and language set. For information about cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or other digital technologies that may be used in connection with your participation, please see section G on <a href="#cookies">Cookies and Other Digital Technologies</a>.<br><br>
    <p>You may also be invited to participate in certain research studies or surveys that ask you to download software, and/or interact with other companies, websites or applications. In the event that additional information is collected, it will be disclosed to you prior to, or at the time of initial collection. You may also be asked to accept other terms in connection with your participation.</p>
    </li><br>
    <li><b>Information we get from other sources.</b> After you join a panel, we may receive additional information about you from other sources, including other Nielsen measurement products.   This may include information such as what you watch or buy, and your exposure to advertising. We obtain this information from many sources, including outside sources. These include, for example: <br><br>
        <ul class="list-circle">
            <li>census data,</li>
            <li>the manufacturers and sellers of the products you purchase or use,</li>
            <li>"loyalty" programs (like those that offer rewards and points),</li>
            <li>organizations that collect online data,</li>
            <li>data suppliers,</li>
            <li>companies that combine purchase information, and</li>
            <li>other entities that have a legal right to provide such information to us.</li>
        </ul><br>
    <p>We may combine the above information with these additional sources. We will use it only for the purposes described in this Notice. By participating in our research, you agree that we may obtain this information about you and combine it in this way.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<b id="use">C.  HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US</b><br>
<ul class="list-disc">
    <li>Information you provide during the recruitment process is used to determine eligibility for participation in one of our panels.  After you agree to participate in our market research activities, we use the information we collect to create a variety of research insights for our clients. <b>We use tools and methods to make sure that there is no reasonable possibility of identifying an individual participant in the reports that we create for our clients.</b> For example, we combine the responses we collect from you with the responses of others to produce “aggregated” reports. We also create scientific reports based upon modeled information. “Modeled information” is data we have developed based upon demographic and behavioral characteristics (like your gender, age, and self-reported&nbsp;purchasing or TV watching habits to predict what people with similar or matching characteristics would watch or buy. For instance, this allows advertisers to identify the likely audience for a marketing campaign.<br><br>
    <p>Our research insights help our clients make choices about where and how they advertise, including on print, broadcast television, radio, online and mobile. Among other things, our solutions have helped clients: </p>
    </li>
        <ul class="list-circle">
            <li>Understand the makeup of the audience that was shown an advertisement while surfing the Internet or interacting with social media</li>
            <li>Identify the types of electronic products consumers in different demographic groups would be likely to buy</li>
            <li>Determine the audience that would be more likely to respond to a particular advertisement online, on a smartphone, or tablet</li>
            <li>Whether residents in a particular neighborhood would be likely to shop at a specialty store if it was nearby</li>
            <li>Understand the media and purchasing habits of different types of potential voters</li>
        </ul><br>
    <li>We may use the information you give us to contact you. When we contact you – by phone, email, SMS, or postal mail depending on what information you provide to us – we will usually do so for one of the following reasons:<br><br>
        <ul class="list-circle">
            <li>to respond to your inquiries;</li>
            <li>to validate answers you gave;</li>
            <li>to update our records to ensure your information is correct;</li>
            <li>to ensure that the software is working properly;</li>
            <li>to send you information regarding your participation such as how to redeem rewards;</li>
            <li>to provide notice regarding changes to our terms, conditions, and policies;</li>
            <li>to ensure compliance with terms of active panel membership; or</li>
            <li>to offer you expanded research opportunities through panels and surveys.</li>
        </ul><br>
     <p>By participating in our research, you agree to be contacted as described above, and also agree to receive push notifications through our software.</p>

    </li><br>
    <li>We may also use the information for business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our Site or software, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our communications.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If we combine non-personal information with personal identifying information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal identifying information as long as it is combined.</p><br>

<b id="share">D. WHEN WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</b><br><br>
<p>We may share your personal identifying information:</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
    <li>With other members of the Nielsen family of companies for the purposes described in this Notice.</li>
    <li>With third parties who provide services for us such as website application hosting; data analysis; infrastructure provision; IT services; email delivery service; auditing services; and reward, incentive, sweepstakes, and other similar services.</li>
    <li>With other companies for the purposes of data processing or market research product development purposes. These companies are contractually required to keep this information confidential and secure and are not permitted to use this information for any other purpose except to carry out the services that they are performing for us.</li>
    <li>To other companies, including clients, in accordance with market research guidelines.  If any such company receives your personal identifying information (whether provided by us to such company or collected by such company directly from you), such company will be bound to keep the information confidential and secure and use it only for research or statistical purposes.</li>
