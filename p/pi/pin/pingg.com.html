</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
how we use it, and
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note:
<i>You must be 18 years or older</i>
and the age of majority in your place of residence to use, subscribe or register as a member of Pingg.com® (or 21 years or older in the event that you place a request for transmission of an order for a product containing alcohol). The Service is a general audience site and we do not knowingly collect, maintain or disclose personal information from or about children under 13 years of age.
</p>
<h3>Why do we gather information?</h3>
<p>
Pingg.com® gathers personal information to help improve our products and customer service, to communicate with you, to process your orders, to provide an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience and to inform you, and your gift and message recipients, of special offers and discounts from us, our affiliated brands and selected third parties.
</p>
<h3>What information do we gather?</h3>
<p>
We collect information through our Web Site, emails, mail, fax, telephone, mobile applications and social media applications (such as our Facebook App) including when you:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
place an order,
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>

Other Members do not have the right to view and edit your Address Book entries.
</p>
<h3>How we use "Cookies" and "Action Tags".</h3>
<p>
A "cookie" is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer. We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer, user or Member and to provide certain features to you. Most web browsers allow you to instruct the browser to prevent the use of cookies. However, if you disable this feature, certain aspects of the Services, such as the shopping basket, may not function properly.
</p>
<p>
We have relationships with third parties who may receive non-personal information directly from the cookies placed by our Services on your computer to assist in analyzing our business and customers.
</p>
<p>
Our Services may also use a common web technology "called "action tags" (also called single pixel gifs or web beacons) to anonymously track purchase, usage and other web activity information. Action tags may be used to provide data to third parties for tracking purposes. However, our Services do not use action tags to collect or transfer personal information.  In addition, third parties may set their own cookies and tags through our Services (such as through interest-based advertising, described below).  We do not control such third parties or their privacy practices.  If you do not want third parties to be able to use such methods, you should modify your browser settings to limit such access. 
</p>
<h3>Interest-based advertising</h3>
<h4>Other services</h4>
<p>
Advertisements for our products and services may appear on third party websites around the Internet. Some websites and services deliver these advertisements based upon data that has been previously collected about your past behavior online. For example, if you have viewed websites about gift baskets, these websites or services may display to you an advertisement for our gift baskets. This kind of targeted advertising is sometimes called interest-based or online behavioral advertising. It is generally not based upon your personal information, but rather, upon your online activities.
</p>
<p>
We do not control such third party websites or services on which these advertisements appear. Further, we do not control how they collect and use data about your online activities. However, you may opt-out of being tracked online by certain companies by visiting
<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>
OR
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.
If you opt-out, you will still receive advertisements, but they will not be delivered to you based upon your behavioral data possessed by the companies from whom you have opted-out. This process relies upon an opt-out cookie, so if you delete your cookies or use a different computer, you will have to repeat this process.
</p>
<h4>Our services</h4>
<p>
In addition, from time-to-time, our Services may also carry advertisements from other companies. Some of these advertisements may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based, for example, on commercial interests you have expressed during your online activities. You may opt-out of receiving this type of targeted advertising by visiting
<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>
OR
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>
to learn more about online behavioral advertising and how to opt-out from interest-based advertising ads served by some or all participating companies. Once again, if you opt-out, you will still receive advertisements, but they will not be delivered to you based upon your behavioral data possessed by the companies from whom you have opted-out. This process relies upon an opt-out cookie, so if you delete your cookies or use a different computer, you will have to repeat this process.
</p>
<h3>How we use the information we collect</h3>
<p>
We use information we collect to communicate with you, to process your orders, to provide an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience, to inform you and your gift and message recipients of offers and discounts from Pingg.com® and our affiliated brands and to enable you to receive credits for purchases under loyalty or buying programs which you have joined. In addition, we may make such information (except for credit/debit card number and expiration date, unless you consent otherwise), including aggregated information, available to selected third parties including, but not limited to, those who share or rent information for direct marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>
However, without your consent, we do not make your or your gift or message recipients' email addresses, available to “third parties” (as that term is defined and limited below). For example, we may make your postal address available to third parties for marketing purposes, however we would not share your email address without your consent. In addition, you may instruct that other personal information about you or your message or gift recipients' that you have provided to us not be shared with third parties by following the instructions in How to Limit the Use of Personal Information, below.
</p>
<p>
We may combine information we receive from you via our Services with information from our Affiliates and third parties. We use the combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us and to communicate with you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3>Consent to Transfer and Submission</h3>
<p>
Our Services are operated in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States. By using the Services or otherwise providing us with information, you hereby consent to this transfer.
</p>
<p>
Although personal information collected by us through the our Services will be used by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy, laws generally applicable to the protection of personal data in the U.S. may not be as stringent as those in other countries.
</p>
<h3>Links to Other Services</h3>
<p>
Pingg.com® wants you to be aware that when you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to affiliated or third-party services, you will be subject to the privacy policies and terms of use of those services, not ours. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement and user terms whenever using, and prior to providing any personal information to, any other service.
</p>
<h3>Security and Passwords</h3>
<p>
If you place an order on our Web site, it encrypts the credit/debit card number you submit prior to transmission over the Internet using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology. This technology works best when the Web Site is viewed using Microsoft IE®, Google Chrome®, Mozilla Firefox®, and Apple Safari® browsers. However, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although we make reasonable efforts to safeguard personal information once we receive it, we cannot warrant the security of information we receive.
</p>
<p>
Portions of the Services (such as our Member registration and Address Book) may require registration and log-in processes in which you will select a user ID and password (collectively, the "Password"). Passwords provided to you by us are the confidential property of the Company and may be used by you solely for your individual use of the Services (and otherwise as specified by us). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any Password and for all activities that occur using your Password, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Password or accounts.
</p>
<p>
We may provide you with the ability to log into our Services using a social media account, such as Facebook Connect. We do not control the activities of such social media services and have no control over the data they collect or their privacy practices. You should review their privacy practices before using any such social media service.
</p>
