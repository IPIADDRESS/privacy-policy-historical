					<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
					<p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how Pinger treats information that it collects and receives related to your use of Pinger's products, services, and websites.
    Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide and improve our products and services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Children's Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    All Pinger products, services and websites are not intended for children under the age of 13, so children under the age of 13 should not use them at any
    time.
</p>
<p>
    Pinger complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), including the COPPA rules effective July 1, 2013, and does not knowingly
    collect any information from children under the age of 13. In the event that Pinger discovers that it has received personal information (as defined under
    Section 312.2 of the COPPA rules effective July 1, 2013) from a child under the age of 13, Pinger will promptly delete such personal information in a
    secure manner.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Safe Harbor Frameworks</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Pinger complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding
    the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland (the "Safe Harbor Frameworks"). Pinger has
    certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To
    learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Pinger's certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Information Pinger Collects and Uses</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Pinger collects information when you use and access Pinger's products, services and website. We categorize the information we collect into three categories
    (collectively referred to as "Customer Information"): Personal Information, App Data and Share Data.
</p>
<p>
    "Personal Information" is information about you that is personally identifiable, including your full name, business or residential address, email address,
    land-line or existing mobile phone number, or billing information.
</p>
<p>
    "App Data" is information about the nature of your usage of Pinger's website and products and services and non-personal information. App Data can include:
    IP addresses, domain servers, referring/exit pages, operating system information, unique device identifiers, such as UDID and/or Ethernet MAC address,
    date/time stamp, clickstream data and information about actions taken by you through interaction with Pinger's products and/or advertising displayed within
    Pinger products, messages sent and received using Pinger services, information about those messages (date, duration, recipients, size, attachments), type
    of device, location information, age, gender, type of web browser, one or more cookies that identify your browser, and telecommunications carrier
    information.
</p>
<p>
    "Share Data" is data and information you provide for use with Pinger's products or services, such as text, audio, and photos you make available through the
    Apps or contacts you add or import for use with Pinger products, and which may be made available to third parties by your actions when using Pinger
    products or services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Pinger uses Customer Information to enhance your use of the Pinger services by processing such information for various purposes, including improving and
    providing Pinger's products and services, product notifications, delivering advertisements and related links, for sending, sharing and storing your Share
    Data as you direct through use of Pinger products and services, and other purposes relating to offering you Pinger products and services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Pinger does not rent, sell, or share any Customer Information unless: you initiate the sharing through the Pinger products, services or website; you
        have provided your express consent; and in the following circumstances:
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Pinger may engage a trusted third party to perform limited functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, sending requested
    postal mail and e-mail, SMS, MMS, and voice communications, analyzing and processing data (such as billing information), and providing customer service. We
    require that these parties agree to use such information in a confidential manner. These third parties may have access to Personal Information needed to
    perform their functions, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes.
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Pinger may share App Data and certain aggregated, non-personal information with third parties, but such information does not include your name, email
    address or any other Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Pinger may share Customer Information to respond to legal requirements, when legally required to do so, or at the request of governmental
    authorities.
</p>
<p>
    (iv) Pinger may share Customer Information to verify or enforce compliance with user agreements and applicable laws, to protect against fraud, to detect
    and prevent security or technical issues, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Pinger products, services, computing systems, or website, or
    to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Pinger, its subscribers or the public.
</p>
<p>
    (v) Pinger may share Customer Information with a successor entity or in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other
    corporate reorganization provided that use of Customer Information is in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    (vi) Pinger may share your Customer Information with a third party if you have consented to receive information from that third party through Pinger
    products or services. Such third parties will handle, store, retain and access such user information in accordance with the terms and conditions of their
    agreements with you, if any, as well as their own privacy policies and as authorized and agreed upon by you as part of agreements for use of our products
    and services. It is your responsibility to carefully review such agreements and privacy policies. You acknowledge that Pinger shall have no liability to
    you for sharing of such information to such third parties as authorized by you and Pinger disclaims any and all liability relating thereto. If Pinger
    desires to use Personal Information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you the opportunity to opt out of
    such use for those other purposes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Cookies</strong>
    <strong> and Tracking</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When you visit Pinger or use Pinger applications, we may send cookies to your computer that uniquely identify your browser or use tracking pixels, agents
    or other visitor identification technology (collectively, “Tags”) that collect App Data. We may also include Tags in promotional materials in order to
    determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
</p>
<p>
    We use and share App Data as provided above.
</p>
<p>
    Most browsers allow you to disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer. If you disable cookies, you may
    not be able to utilize certain Pinger products and services.
</p>
<p>
    We use analytics tools provided by Google, Flurry, adjust, Mixpanel and others (“Analytics Tools”) which also use Tags to collect and analyze information
    about your use of our desktop and mobile applications. We use that information to collect App Data, which we use as provided above. That information is
also used by the Analytics Tools providers according to their privacy policies. You can find more details about how Google uses data it collects here:    <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>. To learn how Flurry collects, uses, and
stores such information, see the Flurry privacy policy at    <a href="https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.htm">https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.htm</a>. You may choose to opt out
of the Flurry services via the Flurry Opt-Out Page, available at    <a href="https://dev.flurry.com/secure/optOut.do">https://dev.flurry.com/secure/optOut.do</a>. Mixpanel’s use of information is set forth in the “Privacy
Policy” section of its Terms of Use available at    <a href="http://www.standsapp.org/privacy-policy/clkn/https/mixpanel.com/terms/">https://mixpanel.com/terms/</a>. You may choose to opt out of the Mixpanel
    cookie at any time at https://mixpanel.com/optout/.
</p>
<p>
    You hereby expressly consent that we is entitled to place Tags for the above-mentioned uses on your computer or device and to use the information gathered
    from Tags as provided in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Security and Data Integrity</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Customer Information under our control. Customer
    Information we collect is stored in a secure manner that is accessible only by authorized Pinger personnel, contractors, and agents bound by
    confidentiality obligations and is only disclosed under the provisions of this Privacy Policy. Our processing of Personal Information is only for the
    purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Periodically, Pinger undertakes a review of its privacy practices to ensure
    that that the information we collect is needed to provide or improve the services we provide.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Links to Third Party Sites</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As a convenience to you, we may provide links and/or connections to third-party web sites or services from within our website or our products or services.
    Pinger is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Access/Removal of Your Personal Information</strong>

<p>
    If you want us to remove your Personal Information from our database, or would like to access the Personal Information we have that was collected from you,
    you can contact us using the contact information provided below. Certain of our products and services require the use of App Data and such data is retained
    by Pinger and used as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Modifications of Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Pinger reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting such change, update or modification on
    the Pinger website and in the app stores from which Apps are made available. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon
    notice, which Pinger may provide by any means, including, without limitation, posting on the Pinger website, notifications within Pinger applications, or
    electronic mail. Your continued use of the Pinger website and/or any Pinger products and services following the posting of changes will mean you accept
    those changes. Use of information that we gather is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Contact Us</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@pinger.com">info@pinger.com</a> or

    efforts to communicate with the complaining party about its concerns to resolve privacy complaints.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you have any complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor Frameworks, you must first contact us (as provided above). If contacting us does
    not resolve your complaint, Pinger will cooperate with JAMS pursuant to the JAMS International Mediation Rules. The dispute resolution process shall be
    conducted in English.
