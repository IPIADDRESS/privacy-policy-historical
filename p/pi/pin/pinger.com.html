		<p>
		(i) Pinger may engage a trusted third party to perform limited 
		functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, 
		sending requested postal mail and e-mail and SMS communications, 
		analyzing and processing data (such as billing information), and 
		providing customer service. We require that these parties agree to use such information in a confidential manner and in compliance 
		with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and 
		security measures. These third parties may have access to Personal 
		Information needed to perform their functions, but we do not permit 
		them to use it for other purposes.<br><br>

		non-personal information and Traffic Data, but such information does
		not identify you individually.<br><br>

		any third party, except that certain Contact Data and Message Data,	
		such as a contact name and message subject header, may be included in

		(iv) Pinger may share Customer Information when legally required to do 
		so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation.<br><br>

		compliance with user agreements and applicable laws, to protect against 
		fraud, to detect and prevent security or technical issues, to protect

		safety of Pinger, its subscribers or the public as required or permitted by law <br><br>

		(v) Pinger may share Customer Information with a successor entity or in 
		connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate reorganization.<br><br>

		other purposes.<br>
