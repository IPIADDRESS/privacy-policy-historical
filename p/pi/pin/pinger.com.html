		<h2 class="hdng">Overview</h2>
		<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Pinger treats information that it collects and receives related to your use of Pinger’s products, services, and website. Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide and improve our products and services.</p>

	<br>

		<p>Pinger adheres to the Safe Harbor privacy principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce's safe harbor program. Pinger processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America. We process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners, but only when you have provided your express consent to allow us to do so.</p>

	<br><br>

		<h2 class="hdng">Information Pinger Collects and Uses</h2>
		<p>Pinger collects information when you use and access Pinger products, services and website. The information collected includes Personal Information, App Data and Share Data (collectively, “Customer Information”). “Personal Information” is information about you that is personally identifiable, like your full name, address, email address, billing information, passwords, home and business addresses, phone numbers, and information that is not otherwise publicly available. “App Data” is information about the nature of your usage of Pinger’s website and products and services and non-personal demographic information.  App Data can include: IP addresses, domain servers, referring/exit pages, operating system information, unique device identifier (UDID), date/time stamp, clickstream data, messages sent and received using Pinger services, information about those messages, type of device, location information, user age and gender demographics, type of web browser, one or more cookies that identify your browser, and telecommunications carrier information. “Share Data” is data you’ve provided for use with Pinger’s products or services and which may be made available to third parties by your actions in using Pinger products or services which constitute your consent for Pinger’s use of Share Data as so directed by you.</p>

	<br><br>

		<h2 class="hdng">Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
		<p>Pinger uses Customer Information to enhance your use of the Pinger services by processing such information for various purposes, including improving and providing Pinger’s products and services, product notifications, delivering advertisements and related links, for sending, sharing and storing your Share Data as you direct through use of Pinger products and services, and other purposes relating to offering you Pinger products and services. </p>

	<br><br>

		<h2 class="hdng">Pinger does not rent, sell, or share any Customer Information unless we have your express consent and in the following circumstances:</h2>
		<p>(i) Pinger may engage a trusted third party to perform limited functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, sending requested postal mail and e-mail and SMS communications, analyzing and processing data (such as billing information), and providing customer service. We require that these parties agree to use such information in a confidential manner and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These third parties may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes.</p>

	<br>

		<p>(ii) Pinger may share with third parties certain aggregated, non-personal information and App Data, but such information does not identify you individually.</p>

	<br>

		<p>(iii) Pinger may share Customer Information when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation.</p>

	<br>

		<p>(iv) Pinger may share Customer Information to verify or enforce compliance with user agreements and applicable laws, to protect against fraud, to detect and prevent security or technical issues, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Pinger products, services, computing systems, or website, or to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Pinger, its subscribers or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>

	<br>

		<p>(v) Pinger may share Customer Information with a successor entity or in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate reorganization provided that use of Customer Information is in compliance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<br>

<p>(vi) Pinger may share your Customer Information with a third party if you have consented to receive information from that third party through Pinger products or services. Such third parties will handle, store, retain and access such user information in accordance with the terms and conditions of their agreements with you, if any, as well as their own privacy policies. It is your responsibility to carefully review such agreements and privacy policies. You acknowledge that Pinger shall have no liability to you for sharing of such information to such third parties and Pinger disclaims any and all liability relating thereto. If Pinger desires to use Personal Information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you the opportunity to opt out of such use for those other purposes.</p>

Customer Information we collect is stored in a secure manner that is accessible only by authorized Pinger personnel, contractors, and agents bound by confidentiality obligations and is only disclosed under the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
