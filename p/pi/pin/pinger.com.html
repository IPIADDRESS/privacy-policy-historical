					<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Pinger treats information that it collects and receives related to your use of Pinger's products, services, and website. Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide and improve our products and services.</p>
<p>Pinger complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland (the "Safe Harbor Frameworks"). Pinger has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

<p><strong>Information Pinger Collects and Uses</strong></p>
<p>Pinger collects information when you use and access Pinger's products, services and website. The information collected includes Personal Information, App Data and Share Data (collectively, "Customer Information"). "Personal Information" is information about you that is personally identifiable, like your full name, address, email address, billing information, passwords, and home and business addresses. "App Data" is information about the nature of your usage of Pinger's website and products and services and non-personal demographic information. App Data can include: IP addresses, domain servers, referring/exit pages, operating system information, unique device identifiers, such as UDID and/or Ethernet MAC address, date/time stamp, clickstream data, messages sent and received using Pinger services, information about those messages, type of device, location information, user age and gender demographics, type of web browser, one or more cookies that identify your browser, and telecommunications carrier information. "Share Data" is data and information you provide for use with Pinger's products or services and which may be made available to third parties by your actions when using Pinger products or services which constitute your consent for Pinger's use of Share Data as so directed by you.</p>
<p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>Pinger uses Customer Information to enhance your use of the Pinger services by processing such information for various purposes, including improving and providing Pinger's products and services, product notifications, delivering advertisements and related links, for sending, sharing and storing your Share Data as you direct through use of Pinger products and services, and other purposes relating to offering you Pinger products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Pinger does not rent, sell, or share any Customer Information unless we have your express consent and in the following circumstances:</strong></p>
<p>(i) Pinger may engage a trusted third party to perform limited functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, sending requested postal mail and e-mail, SMS, MMS, and voice communications, analyzing and processing data (such as billing information), and providing customer service. We require that these parties agree to use such information in a confidential manner and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These third parties may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes.</p>
<p>(ii) Pinger may share with third parties App Data and certain aggregated, non-personal information, but such information does not include your name, email address or information that identifies you personally.</p>
<p>(iii) Pinger may share Customer Information to respond to legal requirements, when legally required to do so, and at the request of governmental authorities.</p>
<p>(iv) Pinger may share Customer Information to verify or enforce compliance with user agreements and applicable laws, to protect against fraud, to detect and prevent security or technical issues, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Pinger products, services, computing systems, or website, or to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Pinger, its subscribers or the public.</p>
<p>(v) Pinger may share Customer Information with a successor entity or in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate reorganization provided that use of Customer Information is in compliance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>(vi) Pinger may share your Customer Information with a third party if you have consented to receive information from that third party through Pinger products or services. Such third parties will handle, store, retain and access such user information in accordance with the terms and conditions of their agreements with you, if any, as well as their own privacy policies and as authorized and agreed upon by you as part of agreements for use of our products and services. It is your responsibility to carefully review such agreements and privacy policies. You acknowledge that Pinger shall have no liability to you for sharing of such information to such third parties as authorized by you and Pinger disclaims any and all liability relating thereto. If Pinger desires to use Personal Information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you the opportunity to opt out of such use for those other purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Security and Data Integrity</strong></p>
<p>We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Customer Information under our control. Customer Information we collect is stored in a secure manner that is accessible only by authorized Pinger personnel, contractors, and agents bound by confidentiality obligations and is only disclosed under the provisions of this Privacy Policy. Our processing of personal information is only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Periodically, Pinger undertakes a review of its privacy practices to ensure that that the information we collect is needed to provide or improve the services we provide.</p>

<p>The Pinger website complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Pinger does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 through the Pinger website. In addition, in the event that a user identifies himself or herself as a child under the age of 13, Pinger will not collect, store or use any Personal Information of such user. Further, in the event that Pinger receives Personal Information that Pinger discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, Pinger will promptly delete such Personal Information in a secure manner.</p>
