            </span>
            <ul class="style3">
              <li><em>- To improve our Site</em><br>
                We continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you.</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="style3"><strong>How we protect your information</strong><br>
            <br>
            We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Site.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Sharing your personal information</strong><br>
            <br>
            We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Third party websites</strong><br>
            <br>

We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website's own terms and policies.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Advertising</strong><br>
            <br>
            Ads appearing on our site may be delivered to Users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile non personal identification information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Compliance with children's online privacy protection act</strong><br>
            <br>
            Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.<br>
            <br>
