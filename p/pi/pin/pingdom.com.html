                Pingdom AB ("Pingdom") operates several websites including pingdom.com and related subdomains. It is Pingdom's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3-small">Website Visitors</h3>
            <p>
                Like most website operators, Pingdom collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Pingdom's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Pingdom's visitors use its website and to better provide related content to its visitors. From time to time, Pingdom may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pingdom also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Pingdom only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3-small">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>
                Certain visitors to Pingdom's websites choose to interact with Pingdom in ways that require Pingdom to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Pingdom gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a account at Pingdom.com to provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Pingdom - by purchasing access to the Pingdom paid service, for example - are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Pingdom collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Pingdom. Pingdom does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3-small">Aggregated Statistics</h3>
            <p>
                Pingdom may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Pingdom may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Pingdom does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3-small">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>
                Pingdom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Pingdom's behalf or to provide services available at Pingdom's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Pingdom's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Pingdom will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Pingdom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Pingdom believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Pingdom, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Pingdom website and have supplied your email address, Pingdom may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Pingdom and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Pingdom takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3-small">Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pingdom uses cookies to help Pingdom identify and track visitors, their usage of Pingdom's website, and their website access preferences. Pingdom visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Pingdom's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Pingdom's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3-small">Business Transfers</h3>
            <p>
                If Pingdom, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Pingdom goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Pingdom may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3-small">Third-party content</h3>
            <p>
                Third-party content appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the partner to recognize your computer each time you interact with the content to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Pingdom and does not cover the use of cookies by any partners.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3-small">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
            <p>
                Although most changes are likely to be minor, Pingdom may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Pingdom's sole discretion. Pingdom encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

    <p class="press-release-intro">Company takes a significant step to support all-types of businesses in managing the performance of their business-critical web application environment</p>

    <p><strong>AUSTIN, TX and SWEDEN – June 18, 2014 –</strong> SolarWinds&nbsp;(NYSE: SWI), a leading provider of powerful and affordable&nbsp;<a href="http://www.solarwinds.com/" target="_blank">IT management software</a>, today announced the acquisition of Pingdom, a leading provider of website monitoring and performance management solutions. The acquisition of Pingdom will allow SolarWinds to expand beyond its traditional on-premise IT Management stronghold to support the evolution of performance management from on premise IT, to IT as a Service, and to IT in the Cloud.</p>

    <ol class="press-release-list">
        <li>In the rapidly emerging Cloud era, complex technologies and application architectures are creating new challenges in developing and managing the availability of business-critical application environments.</li>
        <li>These applications – including the platforms (web, mobile, Cloud) on which they operate – have a level of interdependence and complexity not experienced before.</li>
        <li>With the average user’s expectation that websites, mobile apps and SaaS-based applications will perform within 3-5 seconds, failure to meet this “requirement” risks abandonment.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If an app is slow, the user experience quickly becomes unacceptable, the business’ productivity comes to a screeching halt, and revenue can be lost. SLOW <em>IS</em> THE NEW DOWN.</p>

    <p>“As the mantra for web and applications operations teams moves from ensuring the basic availability of IT infrastructure to delivering performance management for critical application capabilities to end-users, the need for comprehensive performance management products increases,” said Kevin Thompson, CEO and President, SolarWinds. “Based on the feedback we have received from more than 150,000 customers, we know that web applications are becoming ubiquitous and increasingly critical to their businesses. We, as a key partner in solving performance issues, need to move with them through this transition.”</p>

    <p>“We share SolarWinds’ vision of the evolution and development of the Web, web application and mobile application environments in support of business-critical processes,” said Sam Nurmi, CEO, Pingdom. “Comprehensive web app monitoring enables those responsible for web environments to sort through and analyze the vast amount of data created by websites, mobile and web applications, and the technology and infrastructure on which they depend. Access to the right information, delivered in real time, is the difference between reacting to business and driving the business.”</p>

    <h3 class="press-release-header">OVERVIEW:</h3>
    <ol class="press-release-list">
        <li>SolarWinds believes that IT organizations of all sizes will continue to manage existing on-premise infrastructure as they move to rapidly implement new technologies. As such, they will need the same level of easy to use and affordable management products to get a top to bottom view of business-critical applications.</li>
        <li>The individuals responsible for managing these web app environments must answer critical questions in order to maintain performance and availability. Who are my application users? Are they getting the experience they expect? Where are they experiencing lag and why? Where is the problem?</li>
        <li>Pingdom, a leader in the website monitoring and performance market, is dedicated to making the web faster and more reliable by creating easy to use tools and services for website and web application owners, regardless of who they are, where they are and their size.</li>
        <li>Based on the strength of the Pingdom® product, more than 500,000 users worldwide, including some of the biggest brands in the world, entrust their web performance to Pingdom.</li>
        <li>The level of visibility SolarWinds and Pingdom together can provide through their product offerings enables web and application operations teams by proactively identifying and addressing problems before they affect the end-user.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Thompson summarized, “Our approach to solving performance management for on-premise IT will extend to how we approach web application management and, eventually, Cloud management. We will continue to give users the ability to solve a specific management problem or use a combination of integrated products to get a top to bottom view of the application environment and the supporting infrastructure, regardless of where it lives.
