    <div class="legal-container">
        <p>Welcome to Piqora, the online and mobile service of Piqora, Inc. (“Piqora,” “we, ”or, “us”). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p>

        <a name="how_we_collect_and_use_info"></a>
        <h3>How we collect and use information</h3>

        <p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our
        Terms of Use www.piqora.com/terms.</p><br>

        <p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>

        <h3>Information you provide us directly:</h3><p> We ask for certain information such as your email
        address and Pinterest board URL when you register for a Piqora account. We may
        also collect any information you choose to provide if you correspond with us. We may
        also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you
        provide in User Content you post to the Service. If you choose to sign up for a premium
        account, any payment information you provide will be collected and stored by our third
        party payment processor. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to
        you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>

        <h3>Information we may receive from third parties:</h3><p> We may receive information about
        you from third parties. For example, if you connect your User account to a third-party
        connection or log-in, for example, by linking your Facebook or Twitter account to the
        Piqora Service, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its
        service to Piqora. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user
        ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token
        necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third
        party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with
        that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on
        third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Piqora
        Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting
        your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will
        remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.</p>

        <h3>Analytics information:</h3><p> We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party
        analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools
        collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit
        and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this
        analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated
        to identify any particular individual user.</p>

        <h3>Cookies information:</h3><p> When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies —
        a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that
        uniquely identifies your browser and lets Piqora help you log in faster and enhance
        your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about
        how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions
        you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of
        the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close
        your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to
        the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions.
        A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can
        reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
        However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept
        cookies is disabled.</p>
            
        <p>Piqora.com uses the AdRoll display advertising network to collect visitor data on our 
        site and then serve targeted display ads to you on other sites. Our partners use technology 
        such as cookies and web beacons to collect this data. For more information or to opt-out of 
        this type of advertising, please visit AdRoll’s privacy policy. Use of our site implies consent 
        to this privacy policy, which is designed for residents of the US. Any changes to the policy will 
        be posted on this page.</p>

        <h3>Log file information:</h3><p> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser
        or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our
        servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include
        anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
        browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact
        with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such
        information.</p>

        <h3>Clear gifs/web beacons information:</h3><p> When you use the Service, we may employ clear
        gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage
        patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent
        to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.
        The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>

        <h3>Commercial and marketing communications:</h3><p> We use the information we collect
        or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing
        newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email
        messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also
        use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification,
        purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the
        Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>

        <h3>Use of certain service type information we collect about you:</h3><p> We use or may use
        cookies, log file, and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you
        will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b)
        provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the
        effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of
        visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems;
        (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (g) to provide
        advertising to your browser or device.</p>

        <h3>Who we may share your information with:</h3><p> We may share your information with third-
        party business partners for the purpose of providing the Service to you. Those business

        Policy.</p>

        <h3>Who you may choose to share your User Content with:</h3><p> Any information or content
        that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes
        available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. To change

        information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and
        archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.</p>

        names and email addresses, User Content and other user information related to
        the Service may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred in these types of
        transactions. We may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in the
        course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions,
        reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a
        portion of the Piqora.</p>

        <h3>Instances where we are required to share your information:</h3><p> Piqora will disclose

        and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (i) with our third-party business
        partners for the purposes described in the section above on “How We Collect and
        Use Information.” We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally
        identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third
        parties.</p>

        <a name="how_we_store_and_protect_info"></a>
        <h3>HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

        <h3>Storage and Processing:</h3><p> Your information collected through the Service may be stored and
        processed in the United States or any other country in which Piqora or its subsidiaries,
        affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Piqora may transfer information that we
        collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties
        across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around
        the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data
        collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information,
        including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data
        protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the
        U.S. or any other country in which Piqora or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service
        providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in
        this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>Keeping your information safe:</h3><p> Piqora cares about the security of your information,
        and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all
        information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take
        reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting
        you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique
        password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications
        from Piqora, at all times. However, Piqora cannot ensure or warrant the security of
        any information you transmit to Piqora or guarantee that information on the Service may
        not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected
        by changes to the functionality of third party sites and services that you add to the Piqora
        Service, such as social networks. Piqora is not responsible for the functionality or security
        measures of any third party.</p>

        <h3>Compromise of information:</h3><p> In the event that any information under our control is
        compromised as a result of a breach of security, Piqora will take reasonable steps to
        investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information
        may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and
        regulations.</p>

        <a name="your_choices_about_info"></a>

        your profile settings. You can also stop receiving promotional email communications from us
        by clicking on the “unsubscribe link” provided in such communications. We make every effort
        to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. As noted above, you may not opt out of Service-
        related communications (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and
        reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). If you
        have any questions about reviewing or modifying your account information, you can contact us

        mobile device or browser’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable
        cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. Depending on your type of device, it may not be
        possible to delete or disable tracking mechanisms on your mobile device. Note that disabling
        cookies and/or other tracking tools prevents Piqora or its business partners from tracking

        by third parties. However, doing so may disable many of the features available through the
        Service. If you have any questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other
