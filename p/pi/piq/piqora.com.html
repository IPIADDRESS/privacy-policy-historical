We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. If you do not agree to abide by these practices or any future privacy policy, please do not use or access the Site or Services.</p>
<h5>Personal Information We Collect </h5>
<p>When you visit the Site or use the Services we may collect information from you such as your name, email address and phone number (from prospective and existing Customers) and information regarding your social media accounts, uploads and posts (from end users who upload user-generated content to Customer digital properties or use Customer hashtags on their social media posts).

You can connect your social media accounts, such as Facebook, to your Platform account. The social media services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to (i) include Platform elements on Facebook Fan Pages, (ii) follow, like, or comment on others’ social profiles from within your Platform account.</p>
<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. Olapic does not collect IP addresses of end users on behalf of Customers. We may combine automatically collected log information with other information we collect about end users.</p>

<p>If you upload user-generated content to your social media accounts which you tag with our Customers’ brand hashtags, Olapic may collect that content on behalf of our Customers, including your photo, social media username, caption information (if any) and location information (if any). If you upload user-generated content directly to an Olapic Customer digital property, Olapic may collect your email address, prior to the upload, as well as your photo. Generally, the information Olapic collects from end users helps us and our Customers to communicate with end users regarding content that they have submitted through the Olapic Services. For instance, we may use your email address to provide you with an email confirmation of your registration or to notify you of the status of the content you have submitted. Furthermore, our Customers to whom you have submitted content through the Olapic Services or whose brand hashtags you have included in your social media posts may use your username or email address to communicate with you.</p>

<h5>Securing Your Personal Information</h5>
<p>Olapic is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. When you enter sensitive information (such as Customer log in credentials entered onto the Olapic dashboard), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Although we employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we make no guarantee as to the security of your information or that your information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. If you contact us by e-mail or a “contact us” or similar feature on the Site, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. If you have any questions regarding security you can contact us at <a href="mailto:%20privacy@olapic.com">privacy@olapic.com</a>.</p>
<p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>
<h5>Communications From Olapic</h5>
<p>If you opt in to receive marketing communications from Olapic, subscribe to our newsletter(s) or become a Customer of our Services, we will use your name and email address to send communications to you. If you no longer wish to receive these communications you can follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in those emails or contact us at <a href="mailto:%20support@olapic.com">support@olapic.com</a>.We will send Customers service-related announcements when it is necessary or useful to do so. For instance, if our Services are temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, Customers may not opt-out of service-related communications which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account, or provide an alternative email address for contact by contacting us at <a href="mailto:%20privacy@olapic.com">privacy@olapic.com</a>.</p>

<p>Our Web site includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button.

Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>
<h5>Testimonials</h5>
<p>We may post Customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our Site which may contain personally identifiable information. We obtain the Customer’s consent prior to posting the testimonial if we include personal information, such as a name, of the Customer along with the testimonial. If you are the subject of a testimonial and want your testimonial removed, please contact us at <a href="mailto:%20privacy@olapic.com">privacy@olapic.com</a>.</p>
<h5>Public Forums</h5>

To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:%20support@olapic.com">support@olapic.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Alternatively, if you used a third party application to post such information, you can remove it, by either logging into the said application and removing the information or by contacting the appropriate third party application.</p>
<h5>Phishing</h5>
<p>It has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity is known as “phishing”. If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a Web site that does not seem to be affiliated with Olapic, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at <a href="mailto:%20info@olapic.com">info@olapic.com</a>.</p>
<h5>Third Party Links</h5>
<p>Our Site or Services may contain links to third party websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
<h5>Business Transfer</h5>
<p>Olapic regards its databases of user and Customer information (including personal information) as a valuable asset. In the event that Olapic is or substantially all of its assets are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, such databases containing personal information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event of such a transfer, you will be notified via email or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.<s></s></p>
