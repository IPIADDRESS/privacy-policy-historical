		Privacy Policy
	</h1><div id="policy"><p>Piping Rock Health Products, LLC (the “Company,” “we,” or “us”) respects individual privacy and values its relationship with you.  This privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) applies to the website operated by the Company (the “Site”) and explains how we collect, use, share and safeguard information provided by you on the Site.  Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy Policy.  Unless we indicate otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies only to information that we collect on the Site and through our catalog mailings.  </p><p class="bold">When Do We Collect Your Personal Information?</p><p>We collect personal information about you in several situations, including when you provide it to us voluntarily.  For example, we collect information when you make a purchase online, contact us with questions, provide feedback regarding our products or answer questions about your product interests.  You do not have to provide personal information about you, but if you decide not to do so, you may limit the features and services that you are able to access from the Site.</p><p>The personal information we may collect includes:</p><ul class="privacy"><li>contact information, such as your name, mailing address, email address, and telephone number;</li><li>financial payment information, such as credit card, debit card, and other financial payment information;</li><li>account registration information, such as user name, password, and profile information;</li><li>information about your intended use of, or questions about, our products;</li><li>birth date and demographic information;</li><li>certain other information you may provide to us in your communications or in connection with other products or services.</li></ul><p class="bold">What Kind of Tracking Do We Use On Our Site?

		</p><p>We also collect certain information by automated means when you visit our Site, including your internet protocol (“IP”) address; information about your web browser software and version; if you arrived at the Site through a link from a third-party website, the uniform resource locater (“URL”) of the linking page; and your activity on the Site, such as which pages you choose to view, queries you make using our “search” function, and other information about your account usage.  </p><p>Like many companies, we use “cookies,” “web beacons,” and similar technologies on our Site.  These technologies allow us to track your use of our Site, recognize you when you return to the Site, or save your preferences.  We also may include web beacons in e mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and to identify the IP address of the computer on which they were opened.  The information we obtain in this manner helps us customize the services we offer and measure the overall effectiveness of our online content and the products and services we offer through the Site.  Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party.</p><p>You may be able to disable cookies by changing a setting in your web browser.  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of our Site’s features and that your decision to decline cookies from our Site may impact your ability to use other websites as well.</p><p>We may combine information collected from tracking devices and the information we collect in our cookies (as described below) with other information we collect about you.</p><p class="bold">How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</p><p>Once collected, we may use the personal information for the following purposes:</p><ul class="privacy spaced"><li><span class="bold italic">Contact Us.</span>  We will use personal information about you to respond to your questions and comments when you communicate with us through the Site’s “Contact Us” links, or through other areas of our Site.</li><li><span class="bold italic">Shopping.</span>  When you purchase products on our Site, we will use personal information about you to process your purchase, confirm your order, and deliver the items to you.</li><li><span class="bold italic">Email Newsletters and Promotions.</span>  With your permission, we use personal information about you to send you newsletters, exclusive offers and promotions, and product news.

Please note that you may have cookies placed on your computer by third-party websites that refer you to this Site.  Although we do not share your personal information with these third-party sites, they may be able to link certain non-personally-identifiable information we transfer to them with personal information they previously collected from you.  For your own protection, you should review the policies of similar sites to ensure they meet your personal expectations of privacy.</p><p class="bold">How Do We Protect Personal Information? </p><p>We maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information you provide on our Site.

		</p><p>Among other safeguards, we use Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology to help protect transmissions over the internet of your payment card data.  You can confirm that SSL is being used by looking at the URL line of your browser.  When accessing a secure Site, the first characters of the Site’s address will change from “http” to “https.”  If you are using a web browser or a firewall that does not permit communications through our secure Site, you may not be able to make purchases on our Site.</p><p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or stored on a server can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect personal information about you and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of personal information about you.  If you prefer not to transmit your credit card number over the internet, you can contact us using the toll-free number listed on the Site.</p><p class="bold">Children</p><p>The Site is intended for a general audience and is not designed for children under 13 years old.

If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our database.</p><p class="bold">Miscellaneous</p><p>The Site is based in the United States, and therefore, information we collect about you may be stored, processed and accessed in the United States.  By using the Site, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of personal information about you in the United States.</p><p class="bold">Future Changes to the Privacy Policy</p><p>As Piping Rock’s activities and organization change from time to time, this Privacy Policy is expected to change as well.  We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of the Privacy Policy at any time.  The date of the last revision to the Privacy Policy will be indicated at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.  We encourage you to check the Privacy Policy to remain informed of any changes, notice of which will be set forth prominently on this Site.</p><p class="bold">How to Contact Us</p><p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, or if you would like us to update information we have about you or your preferences regarding the use of your personal information, please contact us by:</p><div class="contact"><div class="contact_title">
