										<font>Privacy policy </font><br>
										<br style="line-height:5px;">
										<p>We respect the sovereignty of the individual and the individual right to   privacy. Other than the basic information of name, username and contact email   address, PipsFund.com does not collect personal or business information   from our clients under any circumstances. As a business based in an offshore   financial centre, we enjoy the strict privacy laws of our jurisdiction and are   therefore self mandated to protect the integrity of our client’s privacy.</p>
										<p>If at any time you think you have been solicited by or have received an email   from us, which requests your personal or business information, we can assure you   it will not have come from us. In such instance it would most assuredly be an   individual attempting to spy on your personal affairs and they will be   misrepresenting themselves. We would suggest in such instances that you do not   provide your personal information to them under any circumstances.</p>
										<p>This means names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, credit card   information, national identity numbers, passport numbers, and similar   information (except of course for the initial email address we request from you   when you register an account with us.) That email address is the only private   piece of information we shall ever request from you as you can use any ‘name’   you wish to register your account. It is entirely up to you what email address   you provide at the time of your account registration. It may be an anonymous   email or a web based email. The email you choose for your account registration   is your business. We recommend you use an anonymouse email service or a web   based email service to enhance your online privacy and security.</p>
										<p>Any information disclosed by you for any reason is information you volunteer   and you should assume that volunteered information can be stolen off the web   and/or used and abused by people who may wish to obtain your information. If you   decide to disclose your most sensitive personal and private information to us   and it is subsequently stolen from our database by a hacker thief please be   advised we are not legally liable for such theft or, the subsequent use or abuse   of that information.</p>
										<p>However, if you choose to willfully volunteer   your your most sensitive personal and private information to us, we will not   disclose that information to any party, or sell it, or make it public under any   circumstances whatsoever.</p>
										<p>When under court order, we will provide only   the information specified in the court order. This may include your email if it   resides on our servers. Although this has never happened to our clients, it has   happened to other internet based companies and their clients. Therefore you need   to be responsible with your email and consider encrypting important   communications by using a secure email service such as hushmail or safe-mail,   or, by using the services of a web based provider such as Google, Microsoft or   Hotmail.</p>
										<p>If you do not give your sensitive personal and   private information to us, we cannot provide it to anybody else even if we   wanted to.&nbsp;You are responsible for protecting the secrecy of your password and   account information.</p>
									  <p>Although this web site contains links to other   web sites we assume no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of   other web sites. We encourage you to be cautious if you click on a link to   another web site.&nbsp;You should read it’s privacy statement as many web sites do   collect personally identifiable information.<br>
