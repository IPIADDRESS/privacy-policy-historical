A Show may include, but is not limited to, a radio show, a Podcast, a DJ mix-set or a live recording.</p>
<p>Pippa is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, and then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Pippa may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. This policy is effective from 1st May 2016.</p>

<h3>1. Personal Information</h3>
<p>In order to use certain features of the Website, you will need to register. When registering you will be asked to provide an email address and create a username and password. You may also choose to create a more detailed profile of yourself on the Website by submitting additional personal information. Please note that even if you do not provide any additional personal information to the Website (e.g. by adding it to your user profile), if you choose a username that includes or reveals your name or any other personal information, such information will then be available to other users of the Website and to the general public. For purposes of this Policy, the terms “personal information” and “personally identifiable information” shall mean all information provided during your initial registration on the Website and during your creation of a user profile, including, for example, your real name, e-mail address, postal address and other location information, your age, your gender and certain other demographic information or information that may enable online or offline contact with you. From the moment you register and begin listening to music on Pippa, we will monitor your activity on the website and log this information in our databases. This includes which Shows you listen to or which you have submitted, when you listen to them, how long you listen to them for, which Shows are your favourite and so on. We will also monitor and log your music sharing activities. This information relating to your listening and music sharing activities can be viewed by all other users of Pippa. Pippa may make some of this information available to third parties to undertake development of new products and services via an API.</p>
<p>If you choose to purchase music or other goods or services by clicking on a third party link provided on the Website (for example, a link to www.amazon.com), such third party may collect your personal details (such as your credit card number, address, etc.) for the purpose of completing a transaction. We may be provided with confirmation of your transactions with such third parties and, in some instances, such confirmation may include your personal information. Aside from such confirmations, the only information that we will collect with respect to such third party links is: (a) the number of generic Pippa users who utilized such third party links; and (b) the number of purchases made by these generic users.</p>
<p>Where you upload photographs or other content as part of your user profile, you should be aware that Pippa is entitled to use those photographs and content in accordance with our Terms &amp; Conditions.

<h3>7. How we use cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. We use cookies to recognize you when you return to our Services. We use them in various ways, for example to log you in, remember your preferences (such as default language), and personalize information.<br>
We respect Do Not Track (“DNT”) settings in browsers. If you’re logged out of our Services and have DNT enabled, we will not set cookies. By logging in you are opting to allow Pippa to ignore the DNT setting and to use cookies in order to provide you a personalized experience.<br>
Some third-party services that we use, such as embedly or Google Analytics, may place their own cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by Pippa only and not the use of cookies by third parties.</p>

<h3>10. Transfers of your Information</h3>
<p>We may use third-party partners to help operate our Website, and we may share your information with our affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide products or services for or through this Website or for our business (such as but not limited to Website or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf). Pippa operates an ‘open API’ and web services program, which enables developers and other third parties to freely use statistics and data collected by Pippa to create programs and other interesting services which help develop the Pippa community.</p>
<p>Certain third party individuals or organisations may have access to your personal information (excluding your email contact information) via Pippa’s API and web services or as a result of agreements between Pippa and its preferred partners. However, you should be aware that if you provide your e-mail contact information and/or username directly to any such third parties, they may use your information for their own purposes. Such partners may use such information for their own purposes, which may be either commercial or non-commercial in nature and which may include targeted advertising or direct marketing. These purposes will be outlined to users, enabling users to opt-in or opt-out at any stage with respect to their e-mail addresses being used by third parties for specific purposes. These third parties may be based in Italy or elsewhere (including outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”)).</p>
<p>Certain third-party advertisements on the Website may enable you to submit your username and/or other personal information within the advertisement in order to receive information or services provided by third parties. Such advertisements are provided by third parties, and thus, the collection and use of information submitted via the advertisements is by such third parties and is subject to their privacy policies. Pippa cannot guarantee that all third parties will abide by restrictions as observed by Pippa and as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Of course, you can report any suspected misuse of your personal information to us by emailing us at info@Pippa.io and we will endeavour to investigate your claim. Where we deem it appropriate, we will take appropriate action against such third party, which may include terminating their access to personal information.</p>

These companies may use information (generally not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies and other tracking technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies is generally not personally identifiable unless, for example, you provide personal information to them through an ad or e-mail message. We encourage you to read these businesses’ privacy policies if you should have any concerns about how they will care for your information.

<h3>14. Business Transitions</h3>
<p>If Pippa is acquired by another company or sells all or a portion of its assets to another company, or in the event of a merger, it is likely that user information will be a part of the assets transferred. If as a result of such a business transition information is to be collected, used or disclosed in a manner or for a purpose different from that stated above, Pippa will endeavour to notify all users of such changes beforehand.</p>

<h3>15. Consent</h3>
<p>By disclosing any information to Pippa through the Website and by using the Website as a registered user, you are consenting to the collection, storage and use of your personal information by Pippa as set out in this Policy and the Terms and Conditions, and you understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories. If you do not consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories, then you should not use the Website as a registered user, which means that many features will be unavailable to you. When you give your personally identifiable information to Pippa, it may be used by Pippa and its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries for the purposes of, for example but not limited to, providing you services and sending you correspondence, and additionally may be transferred to entities other than Pippa’s affiliates, which entities may be located in countries outside the EEA, including the United States. Each of these countries has different privacy laws that afford varying levels of protection for your personally identifiable information, and such laws may not be as comprehensive as those that exist in the EEA. By registering with Pippa, you consent to Pippa’s and its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries’ transmission to, and processing of your information in, any jurisdiction, in accordance with its Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>16. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>If Pippa makes any changes to this Policy these changes will be detailed on this page in order to ensure that you are fully aware of what information is collected, how it is used and under what circumstances it will be disclosed. If you are concerned about how your information is collected, used or disclosed, you should periodically check back at this page. If you have any specific concerns not addressed in the Policy, please contact us using the feedback page on the Website.</p>
<p>If you decide that you do not want your personal information to be used in the way described in this Policy, you can send us a notice that you wish to withdraw your consent as set out above by emailing info@Pippa.io. If you do not provide your consent, or if you withdraw your consent, you should not use the Website as a registered user, since many of the Website’s features are based on users’ consent and will therefore be unavailable to you.</p>
