<p><b>Wireless Marketing Services<br>
</b>Roundy’s may invite you to register to receive alerts, promotions, services, news, and other information (each a "Wireless Marketing Service") via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones. Such Wireless Marketing Services are provided by Roundy’s and/or its contractors or vendors for Roundy’s. Wireless Marketing Services are limited to adult subscribers who reside in the United States and are void where prohibited.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive a Wireless Marketing Service, you must expressly consent to receive that Wireless Marketing Service from Roundy’s.</p>
<p><i>Availability.</i>&nbsp;In order to receive Wireless Marketing Services, you generally must have a text messaging service plan from a participating wireless service provider. Our Wireless Marketing Services may not be available in all geographic areas or work on all mobile or wireless devices. Mobile devices that can receive text messages (SMS Service) are generally able to receive text alerts. You agree that Roundy’s will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any Wireless Marketing Services or related messages, as delivery depends on the effective transmission from your carrier or network operator. Please contact your wireless provider if you have questions regarding your SMS service.</p>
<p><i>Personal Information.</i>&nbsp;The personal information&nbsp;requested as part of the registration process may include a user's telephone number, a wireless email address or the carrier's name. Additional information may be requested for specific Wireless Marketing Services, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, or other similar information. Subject to applicable law, we may use this personal Information in accordance with our Online Privacy Statement.</p>
<p><i>Security/Delivery.</i>&nbsp;You should keep in mind that most wireless transmissions are not secured. There is a greater risk that an unauthorized third party may intercept your messages or your personal information when you use a wireless communications device. Therefore, if you choose to sign up for any Wireless Marketing Services, you agree that Roundy’s will not be liable to you for damages caused by a third party's interception of such items.</p>
<p><i>Potential Charges.</i>&nbsp;Roundy’s does not charge users for its Wireless Marketing Services. However, your carrier's standard message and data rates may apply. Charges may show up on your mobile bill or may be deducted from your prepaid account. By registering to receive Wireless Marketing Services, you agree that you may be charged by your wireless carrier for any messages that you send to or receive from Roundy’s and that you are solely responsible for such charges. Under no circumstances will Roundy’s be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges, whether incurred by you directly or as a result of the activity of another person with access, whether or not authorized, to your wireless device, telephone number, or email address. Please contact your wireless carrier if you have any questions about your wireless service.</p>
