If you do not agree with any of it, please do not use our Picbear. By using or accessing the Picbear, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

                <p>
                    At Picbear we value the privacy of our users and it’s important for us that you understand what happens to the information you provide to us. This document is to help you understand how we use, store, collect and disclose your data.

                <h4>Collection of Information</h4>
                <p>
                    You are free to browse this Picbear without revealing any personal information making it possible to identify you. However, once you have sent us your identifiable personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. We collect two types of information from Users/Organizers of the Picbear: “Automatic Anonymous Information” and “Identifiable Personal Information”.
                </p>

                <h4>Automatic Anonymous Information</h4>
                <p>
                    The Picbear/Contest Tool make it possible to monitor certain information automatically, based on your behaviour. This information does not identify you personally. We use this information to improve the Content and functionality of the Picbear/Contest Tool, and to better understand and satisfy our visitors. This information may include the browser you use, your IP address or other information. This information is referred to herein as the AAI.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Identifiable Personal Information (IPI)
                </h4>
                <p>
                    IPI is individually identifiable information about you that allows us to identify or contact you. Some of the Picbear’s functions require asking you for certain IPI, such as your instagram username, instagram password and/or other personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But we do not handle your Instagram passwords directly. We use Instagram's API and OAuth 2.0 protocol to authorize Our users. Our databases are secured with passwords to guard against unauthorized access of Our systems. Only engineer staff members may access data on a need-to-know basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may choose to provide IPI in order to access certain functions on the Picbear. You can always choose not to provide certain information, but in that case it may be that you cannot use certain of the Picbear’s functions.

We may bundle and share the non-personal information we collect from you and other users with advertisers, third parties, trusted partners and affiliates so that they display advertising that better suits your interests. We may aggregate your PII with information about others.

We may use and/or share the resulting non-PII with third parties. We may provide some non-personal information to others who help us understand how you use the Picbear.
