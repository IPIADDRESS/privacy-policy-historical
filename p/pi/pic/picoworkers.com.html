    in helping you promote your website, product, etc. (c) find people who will
    </span>d<span lang="">o work for you – finish tasks you usually are not able to 
    finish yourself or you want more people to work on a task (d) convert your 
    work into earnings. We understand you may not want everyone in the world to 
    access your personal information; that is why all personal information is 
    hidden from other users. Our privacy settings does not allow other users to 
    see your personal information except your </span>Picoworkers<span lang=""> ID,
