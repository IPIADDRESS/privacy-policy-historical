            We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users' Personally Identifiable Information to provide offers and improve the content of the Site for the user.

          <b>A. Cookies:</b><br>
          A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any Personally Identifiable Information while a user is visiting our Site. We use both "session cookies" and "persistent cookies". For the "session cookie," once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A "persistent cookie" is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still browse our site, but they will not be able to buy or sell reservations. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

Log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring pages, platform type, date/time stamp. IP addresses, etc. are linked to Personally Identifiable Information. We use log files in error diagnostics, session management and in determining our advertising efficacy.
