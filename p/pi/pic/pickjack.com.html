            <b>Profile</b><br><br>
            We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users' Personally Identifiable Information to provide offers and improve the content of the Site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Site. This information may also be used to help improve our overall services. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any

          <b>Personally Identifiable Information you submit while on our Site.</b><br>
          <b>A. Cookies:</b><br>
          A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any Personally Identifiable Information while a user is visiting our Site. We use both "session cookies" and "persistent cookies". For the "session cookie," once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A "persistent cookie" is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still browse our site, but they will not be able to buy or sell reservations. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

          <p align="justify">
          <b>B. Log Files:</b><br>
          Like most standard website servers, we use "log files". Log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring pages, platform type, date/time stamp. IP addresses, etc. are linked to Personally Identifiable Information. We use log files in error diagnostics, session management and in determining our advertising efficacy.

          Members who register on the site will receive a number of e-mails throughout the transaction process and they may sometimes receive phone calls from our Customer Service department to ensure smooth transactions. We may also occasionally send out service-related announcements (e.g., if our Services are temporarily suspended for maintenance). These communications are not promotional in nature, and users will receive them as long as their accounts are open.

          <p align="justify">
          <b>B. Special Offers, Newsletters and Updates:</b> <br>
          Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications, as explained in the Choice and opt-out section below.
          </p>
          
          <p align="justify">
          <b>C. Customer Service: </b><br>

Simply select the alerts which you no longer wish to receive and click the "unsubscribe" button. </li>
          <li> From the Site: If you have a username and password, log into your account by clicking the Login link on the home page. Then click the "My Account" link on the top navigation bar.

          <b>Legal Disclaimer:</b><br>
          Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may disclose personal information when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such action is necessary under applicable law.

          In the event PJLLC goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via prominent notice on our Site for 30 days after a change of ownership or control of their personal information, if personal information will be used contrary to this policy. If as a result of the business transition, the users' Personally Identifiable Information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, users will be given the option to continue sharing their information consistent with our notification of changes section. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of PJLLC to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including the Site), for any purposes, without any limitation whatsoever. PJLLC specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of Personally Identifiable Information collected from its Site to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.
