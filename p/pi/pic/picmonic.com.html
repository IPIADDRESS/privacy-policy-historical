<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your privacy is very important to all of us at Picmonic, LLC (“</span><span class="s2">Picmonic</span><span class="s1">”). We have established this privacy policy (“</span><span class="s2">Privacy Policy</span><span class="s1">”) to explain to you how your personal information is protected, collected and used. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address, phone number, and email address, that is not otherwise publicly available (“</span><span class="s2">Personal Information</span><span class="s1">”).

From time to time, Picmonic may modify this Privacy Policy and post such modifications here on this Site. Your use of this Site after any such modification constitutes your acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy. By submitting Personal Information to us through this Site, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the Picmonic Terms of Use, available at <a href="http://picmonic.com/picmonic-terms-of-use/">http://picmonic.com/picmonic-terms-of-use/</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Information Collection &amp; Use</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To access services offered by Picmonic via the Site, you will be required to create a user account, including user ID and password, and input certain Personal Information, including your email address.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Picmonic collects Personal Information from you through the Site to allow us to provide access to services and products that most likely meet your needs and preferences. We only collect Personal Information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In general, you can browse the Site and “opt-out” from providing us with any Personal Information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Once you agree to provide us with Personal Information, you are no longer anonymous to us. If you choose to purchase and use our services through this Site, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information and other Personal Information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. In the event that you select a monthly recurring subscription, you authorize Picmonic to maintain your credit card and billing information and to charge you monthly as indicated on the Site during the subscription process. You understand and agree that Picmonic will not send you monthly invoices or bills. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use or purchase a particular service. You may always cancel your subscription by following the links throughout the Site. Upon cancellation of your subscription, Picmonic will cease authorizing further monthly recurring charges, as applicable. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial information. We use your financial information, including credit card information, to verify the accuracy of your name, address and other information, as well as to bill you for your use of our services and products.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We may track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand our customers. This information may include, but may not be limited to, the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, your computer browser information, and your IP address.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you choose to post messages on this Site or leave feedback for other customers, we will collect that information you provide to us. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect and retain such information in a file specific to you.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Use of Your Personal Information</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We use your Personal Information, including your email address, to facilitate your registration and the subscription by you of our services upon your request and purchase, or the purchase of our services by third parties on your behalf. We use your Personal Information, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site to: resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; collect subscription fees owed; measure consumer interest in our products and services; inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our Terms of Use Agreement; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes. We may compare and review your Personal Information for errors, omissions and for accuracy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You agree that we may use your Personal Information, including your email address, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize the Site’s content, layout, and services. You further agree that we may use your name, school name, and any images uploaded to the Site in a searchable database to allow other users or third parties to search for that information and purchase our services on your behalf. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Site and our products.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Communications from the Site</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We may occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe from each of these communications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>If you no longer wish to receive our promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each such communication or by contacting us.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You will be notified when your Personal Information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if access to our services and products is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account and subscription for our products.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a matter of policy, we do not sell, rent or share any of your Personal Information, including your email address, to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that your Personal Information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services and products to customers:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">External Service Providers</span><span class="s1">: There may be separate services offered by third parties that we refer to as external service providers that may be complementary to your use of the Site. If you choose to use these separate services or products, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. We do not disclose your Personal Information, including your email address, to external service providers unless you provide your explicit consent. With your consent we may provide some of your Personal Information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent our disclosure of your Personal Information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services or products. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Internal Service Providers</span><span class="s1">: We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you and therefore we may provide some of your Personal Information, including your email address, directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced Picmonic related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your Personal Information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Legal Requests</span><span class="s1">: Picmonic cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you, other users, and Picmonic from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, username history, and fraud complaints without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or report suspected illegal activity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other Personal Information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose Personal Information, including your email address, to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your Personal Information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should neither rely upon nor expect, that your Personal Information or private communications will always remain private.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Log Files</b></span></p>
