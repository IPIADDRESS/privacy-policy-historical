			<h4>As the Picsquare website continues to develop, we will add new features, and we may change the type of information we collect or the method by which the information is collected.

			<h3><b>Policy Differences </b></h3>
			<h4>If we update our privacy policy, any information you have provided us before the policy change will be used in accordance with the privacy policy in effect when your information was collected. If we are going to use your personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether or not we can use your information in this different manner. If you no longer have an active or valid account, then you will not be contacted, and your personal information not be used. If we make any material changes in our privacy policy that do not affect your personal information already stored in our database, we will post notification on our website notifying you of the change. In some cases when we post a notice, we will also e-mail users who have opted to receive communications notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</h4>
