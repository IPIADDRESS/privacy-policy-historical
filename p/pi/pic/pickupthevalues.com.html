                        <h2>How Information is Collected</h2>
                        <p>
                            Information is collected from
                            you directly and with your knowledge. There are some features and functionality
                            of this Site that require you to sign up to use them.&nbsp; If you do sign up to
                            use such features, we use the information you supply for the purpose of providing
                            the products, product information or services you request.</p>
                        <h2>What We Do with Your Information</h2>
                        <p>
                            When you voluntarily sign
                            up on this Site, we add your name, email address and street address to our mailing
                            list. &nbsp;If you do not wish to receive these mailings, you may request to be
                            removed from our mailing list by visiting this link, or by calling <b>1-888-525-8373</b>.&nbsp;
                            With your permission, we may share information such as your name, email address
                            and street address with carefully selected companies (“partners”) whose offers may
                            be of interest to you.&nbsp; Your permission is given by “opting in” to programs
                            with partners. &nbsp;Even if you “opt in”, your date of birth, the dates of birth
                            of your family members and credit card information are never shared. &nbsp;You may
                            “opt out” of partner offers and programs at any time by updating your user profile,
                            <a href="http://www.kimberly-clark.com/contact-us.aspx" target="_blank" title="Contacting Us" class="linkRed">contacting us</a> or calling <b>1-800-665-9773</b> (on weekdays during 8 AM to 4 PM
                            Central Standard Time). &nbsp;Our partners are prohibited from using your contact
                            information for purposes other than presenting relevant offers and programs, and
                            they are required to maintain your contact information in confidence. &nbsp;Our
                            Site sometimes includes notices of sweepstakes or other promotions we are conducting,
                            and we may permit you to send your entry electronically in some cases.&nbsp; If
                            that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting
                            the promotion (i.e., to contact you if you're a winner).</p>
                        <h2>Interest-Based Advertising</h2>
                        <p>
                            Kimberly-Clark participates in interest-based
                            (on-line behavior) advertising. This means that you may see advertising on our website
                            tailored to how you browse or shop, or you may see advertising for Kimberly-Clark
                            products on other websites based on your browsing behavior across websites. &nbsp;You
                            may opt-out of such interest-based advertising through the same “opt out” methods
                            identified in the previous paragraph.&nbsp; Kimberly-Clark voluntarily participates
                            in the Digital Advertising Alliance self-regulation program.&nbsp; As part of this
                            self-regulation program, Kimberly-Clark supports deployment of the Advertising Option
                            icon (“Ad Choices”) in partnership with Evidon.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Privacy for Mobile Applications</h2>
                        <p>
                            You may choose to download mobile applications
                            offered by Kimberly-Clark.&nbsp; If you use one or more of our mobile applications,
                            &nbsp;the mobile application[s] collects certain information automatically, such
                            as the type of mobile device you use, the temporary or persistent unique device
                            identifiers (sometimes called UDID) and information about the way you use the applications.
                            &nbsp;The mobile applications also collect certain information you voluntarily provide,
                            such as product information when you scan a bar code, and transactional information,
                            such as when you make a purchase or respond to an offer.&nbsp; Our mobile applications
                            may collect precise information about the location of your device, such as when
                            you search for a store.&nbsp; However, you must first provide permission through
                            your device before the application obtains such location information from technologies
                            like GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower proximity (or a combination of these technologies).
                            &nbsp;Mobile service providers may collect device-specific information, such as
                            a unique device identifier, when you use our Site or one of our mobile applications.

                            can send you offers and promotions about their products and services; (5) You may
                            choose whether to receive interest-based advertising; and (6) You may request access
                            to the personal information we hold about you and that we amend or delete it and
                            we request partners with whom we have shared the information do the same.</p>

                            is collected on a web page enhanced with secure sockets layer protocol to protect
                            the confidentiality of the data. &nbsp;No transmission of data over the internet
                            or other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. We make reasonable
                            efforts to secure your personal information once we receive it, but we cannot guarantee
                            the security of information you send to us.<b></b></p>

                        <h2>Children</h2>
                        <p>
                            Kimberly-Clark is committed to
                            protecting the online privacy of children and making the internet safe. Our Privacy
                            Policy and practices reflect applicable laws and regulations on children's privacy.
                            &nbsp;We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years
                            of age. &nbsp;Any communication we get that is identified as being from a child
                            under 13 will not be kept by Kimberly-Clark. &nbsp;We encourage parents or guardians
                            of children under 13 to regularly check and monitor their children’s use of email
                            and other activities online.</p>
                        <h2>Cookies</h2>
                        <p>
                            Like many companies, Kimberly-Clark uses "cookie"
                            technology on our Site. Cookies are information stored on your computer by your

                            from your computer. &nbsp;We do use the cookie to help us identify site features
                            in which you have the greatest interest so that we can provide more of what you
                            may want. &nbsp;We use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising.&nbsp;
                            These files enable us to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in
                            turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. &nbsp;The
