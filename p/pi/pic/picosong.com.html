<h2>Privacy Policy:</h2>
<p>It is picosong’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information
we may collect while operating our website.</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, picosong collects non-personally-identifying
information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
the date and time of each visitor request. picosong’s purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
picosong’s visitors use its website. From time to time, picosong may
release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>picosong also collects potentially personally-identifying information
like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. picosong does not use such
information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such
information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and
discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to picosong’s website choose to interact with picosong in
ways that require picosong to gather personally-identifying information. The
amount and type of information that picosong gathers depends on the nature of
the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account to
provide a username and email address. In each case, picosong collects such
information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose
of the visitor’s interaction with picosong. picosong does not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors
can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the
caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
activities.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>picosong may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
website. For instance, picosong may monitor the most popular pages on the
picosong site. picosong may display this information publicly or provide it to
others. However, picosong does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>picosong discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors
and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order
to process it on picosong’s behalf or to provide services available at
picosong’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
located outside of your home country; by using picosong’s website, you consent
to the transfer of such information to them. picosong will not rent or sell
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
as described above, picosong discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when
picosong believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
protect the property or rights of picosong, third parties or the public at
large. If you are a registered user of an picosong website and have supplied
your email address, picosong may occasionally send you an email to tell you
about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with
what’s going on with picosong and our products. We primarily use our product
blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type
of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support
email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish
it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
support other users. picosong takes all measures reasonably necessary to
protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the
visitor returns. picosong uses cookies to help picosong identify and track
visitors, their usage of picosong website, and their website access
preferences. picosong visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using picosong’s
websites, with the drawback that certain features of picosong’s website may
not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising
partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize
your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows
ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they
believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
cookies by picosong and does not cover the use of cookies by any
advertisers.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p> Although most changes are likely to be minor, picosong may change its
Privacy Policy from time to time, and in picosong’s sole discretion. picosong
encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its
Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this
Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
