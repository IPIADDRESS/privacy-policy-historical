                    <p>You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to visit the Site.
                        Cars.com automatically collects Usage Data (as described below) and may collect ZIP codes and
                        other information in connection with your use of the Site (e.g., the type of car you are
                        looking for). Cars.com collects personally identifiable information only when you make it
                        available through your use of the Site. You may be required to provide personally identifiable
                        information to use certain services on this Site, including, but not limited to, the "Email the
                        Dealer/Seller" feature and to purchase and create a "Sell It Yourself" online classified
                        listing ("<u><strong>SIY Ad</strong></u>") and account ("<u><strong>SIY Account</strong></u>").
                        In addition, you may submit personally identifiable information through the Site in other ways,
                        including: (a) participating in online surveys, promotions, contests and sweepstakes; (b)
                        subscribing to newsletters, editorial content, or promotional content sent via email, (c) using
                        the Site's "Feedback" and "More Information" forms; and (d) in connection with other products,
                        services, features, or requests made available through the Site. We also publish toll-free
                        phone numbers for many of the dealerships that list vehicles for sale on the Site. If you dial
                        one of these phone numbers, Cars.com or a service provider operating on Cars.com's behalf may
                        record the date, time and length of your call and the phone number from which the call
                        originated, along with other information that may be captured. Any Usage Data (as defined in
                        the next section) and/or personally identifiable information resulting from such calls may be
                        used as described in this Statement. The types of personally identifiable information that you
                        provide will depend on the nature of the submission, but could include your name, address,
                        phone number, email address and credit card information. In the event that you purchase a SIY
                        Ad in a print/online package through a newspaper Affiliate, the Affiliate is required to share
                        your name, phone number and email address with Cars.com in order to allow Cars.com to process
                        and maintain your ad.</p>

                        Information Sharing
                    </h4>
                    <p>Cars.com shares the personally identifiable information that you provide with third parties in
                        the
                        following cases:</p>

                    <p>1.&nbsp;<u>Affiliates</u>. Cars.com may share your personally identifiable information with
                        Affiliates on the
                        condition that the Affiliates' disclosure and use of the information is consistent with this
                        Statement.</p>

                    <p>2.&nbsp;<u>Requests</u>. If you request information or services through the Site, you agree that
                        Cars.com may
                        share personally identifiable information with third parties as may be necessary to provide
                        such
                        information to or perform such services for you. For example, if you use the Site's "Email the
                        Dealer" form in a vehicle listing to request a price quote from a dealership, Cars.com will
                        share
                        the information you entered with that dealership (or its designee). If that vehicle listing was
                        provided by an automobile manufacturer on behalf of a dealer, Cars.com may also share the
                        personally identifiable information you submit as part of the request with the automobile
                        manufacturer and/or its affiliates. Similarly, if through the Site you request additional
                        information from a financial institution, Cars.com will share your information with that
                        institution. Personally identifiable information also may be included in reports to these third
                        parties, but only when you have intended to submit the information to the third party as
                        described
                        above. After the information is provided to such third parties, the subsequent use or
                        disclosure of
                        such information is subject to those third parties' privacy policies and practices and Cars.com
                        does not control their subsequent use or disclosure of information.</p>

                    <p>3.&nbsp;<u>Sweepstakes/Promotions</u>. In the event that you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or
                        other
                        promotion on the Site that is sponsored by Cars.com and a third party, Cars.com reserves the
                        right
                        to share personally identifiable information collected in conjunction with the sweepstakes,
                        contest
                        or promotion with the third party. After the information is provided to such third parties, the
                        subsequent use or disclosure of such information is subject to those third parties' privacy
                        policies and practices.</p>

                    <p>4.&nbsp;<u>Direct Marketing</u>. Except as provided herein, it is Cars.com's policy not to disclose
                        personally
                        identifiable information of our customers to third parties specifically for the third parties'
                        direct marketing purposes. If you are 18 years of age or older and have affirmatively agreed to
                        receive third-party direct marketing materials, Cars.com may share personally identifiable
                        information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Although Cars.com will notify all
                        third-party direct marketers that the information provided to them is confidential, the
                        subsequent
                        use or disclosure of such information is subject to those third parties' privacy policies and

                    <p>5.&nbsp;<u>Service Providers</u>. Cars.com may work with third parties that provide services on its
                        behalf,

                        research,
                        credit card processing, technical and other services. For example, Cars.com may ask that a
                        third
                        party conduct an online survey or sweepstakes or send newsletters on its behalf. Similarly, if
                        you
                        make a payment to Cars.com by credit card, Cars.com may share your personally identifiable
                        information and credit card information with a third party in order to process credit card
                        transactions, or such information may be collected directly by the credit card processing
                        service
                        provider on Cars.com's behalf. In such cases, Cars.com asks that the third party maintain your
                        personally identifiable information as confidential and use the information only to perform the
                        services specified by Cars.com.</p>

                    <p>6.&nbsp;<u>Email List Opt-Outs</u>. In the event Cars.com sends promotional emails to you on behalf
                        of
                        third-party advertisers and you inform Cars.com you wish to opt out of future promotional
                        emails
                        from a particular third party, Cars.com may share your email address with that third party so
                        the
                        third party may add you to its opt-out lists.</p>

                    <p>7.&nbsp;<u>Other</u>. Cars.com expressly reserves the right to release any personally identifiable
                        information
