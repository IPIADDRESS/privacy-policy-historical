The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br><br><strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong>Users can visit our site anonymouslyOnce this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.<br>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>&nbsp;On our Privacy Policy PageUsers are able to change their personal information:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>&nbsp;By emailing us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>&nbsp;By calling us<br><br><strong>How does our site handle do not track signals?</strong>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.<br><br><strong>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</strong>It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking<br><br><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong><br>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
