<strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT / USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong>
<p>KingsIsle collects information that can be used to identify or contact a particular person (we refer to this type of data as "<strong>personal data</strong>").

In addition, we may allow select third-party partners to passively collect certain information from you through your use of our Online Games and Services.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: You may have a separate account for each Online Game and Service that you register for, or you may be able to use a single account across all of our Online Games and Services. In either case, this Privacy Statement applies to your use of our Online Games and Services and each separate environment or component thereof.</p>
<strong>Active Information Collection</strong>
<p>Much of the personal data we collect from our visitors and players is submitted by visitors/players in response to our requests, such as during the registration process, or in response to polls, forums, promotional offers or other interactivity incorporated into our Online Games and Services.

</ul>
<p>We collect, use, store, organize, structure, disclose, or otherwise process this personal data for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We process personal data for the purposes for which such personal data was provided. For example, if you share your name and contact information with us when submitting an inquiry or registering to play one of our games, we will use this information to respond to you or provide you with access to the relevant game and manage your account with us. The relevant legal basis under European law (where applicable) is our legitimate interest to guarantee the stability and security of our Online Games and Services, provide, manage and optimize our products and services (including our Online Games and Services), and provide customer support.</li>
	<li>To engage in direct marketing activities, including to personalize your experience on our Online Games and Services and to deliver content and product offerings relevant to your interests, including targeted offers and ads through our Online Games and Services, third-party websites and games, and via email or text message.

The relevant legal basis under European law (where applicable) is our legitimate interest to provide customer support and keep visitors/players information of our practices and terms. In specific circumstances, we may need to engage in these activities in order to comply with an applicable law. Where we process your personal data to meet our legal obligations, you will likely not be permitted to object to this processing activity, but you will usually have the right to access or review this information unless it would impede our legal obligations.</li>

Depending on the Online Games and Services and your computer or device permissions, we may collect information about your device's approximate (<em>for example</em>, country or zip code) or precise location ("<strong>location data</strong>"). Various technologies may be used to collect this location information, such as IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may provide information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points, and cell towers. <strong>We will only collect your computer's or device's precise location with your consent.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Cookie data</strong>. Our Online Games and Services also use technologies which are common among websites and online environments to collect and store certain information (such as log data or unique identifiers) when you visit or interact with our Online Games and Services. These technologies include cookies, Web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs), statistical identifiers, and similar technologies. A "<strong>cookie</strong>" is a unique numeric code that is transferred to your computer or device to track your interests and preferences and to recognize you as a return visitor. A "<strong>Web beacon</strong>" is a transparent graphic image placed on a website that enables the monitoring of things such as user activity and site traffic. "<strong>Statistical identifiers</strong>" refer to identifiers created using certain device information and identifiers that makes your browser or device sufficiently distinct for a server or similar system to reasonably determine that it is encountering the same browser or device over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Online Games and Services use cookies and similar technologies to help us secure our Online Games and Services, as well as the information processed by our Online Games and Services; to monitor and enhance the performance of our Online Games and Services; to remember your preferences on our Online Games and Services; to collect "clickstream" data which reflects activities on our Online Games and Services such as the features you visit and in what order; to better understand visitor and user behavior; and to facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and website features.</p>
<p>The relevant legal basis under European law (where applicable) is our legitimate interest to guarantee the stability and security of our Online Games and Services, provide, manage and optimize our products and services (including our Online Games and Services), improve your experience while using our Online Games and Services, promote our products and services, provide customer support, develop new products and services, better understand users and their preferences, and measure and manage the frequency of our ads.</p>
<p>We may tie personal data actively collected from you to information collected passively as described above or from third parties. <em>In such cases, if we associate non-personal data with personal data, the combined information will be treated as personal data for as long as it remains combined.</em></p>
<strong>Do Not Track</strong>
<p>Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites with which the browser communicates. The webserver for our Online Games and Services does not currently respond to these signals.</p>
<strong>Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies by Our Online Partners</strong>
<p>We may use vendors and other online partners to perform some of the activities described above, including to provide audience measurement and analytics services, to serve ads on our behalf on our Online Games and Services and on third-party sites, and to track and report on the performance of such ads. These online partners may use cookies and similar technologies to collect and store certain log data, location data, cookie data and other information when you visit or interact with our Online Games and Services and other unaffiliated sites in order to identify your browser or device and provide their respective services. Further, these online partners may combine data collected on our Online Games and Services with information collected on unaffiliated sites or with any other data maintained by these online partners. Their use of data collected on our Online Games and Services and third-party sites will be subject to their own terms of use and privacy policies.</p>
<p>For example, we may use third-party cookies to deliver our ads on third-party websites through a common form of online advertising known as "retargeting." Retargeting works by serving ads on one website based on an individual's activities on a different website. To do this, we allow our online partners (such as Google or other ad network vendors) to serve their own third-party cookies when users visit our Online Games and Services, allowing these online partners to recognize users who have previously visited our Online Games and Services. When these users visit a third-party website that includes features provided by our online partners (for example, where our online partners have purchased ad space), our online partners can recognize the users' interest in our products and services and deliver one of our ads on the third-party website.</p>
<strong>Your Cookie Choices</strong>
<p>Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. However, browsers typically allow individuals to remove or block browser cookies if they choose.

<p><strong><em>BY CONTINUING TO USE OUR ONLINE GAMES AND SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</em></strong>.</p>
<strong>INTERACTION WITH SIGN-IN SERVICES AND SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS</strong>
<p>From time-to-time, our Online Games and Services may allow you to log in using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect, Apple’s Game Center, or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and may provide you the option to share certain personal data with us such as your name, email address, and resume to pre-populate our sign up form. Once your identity has been authenticated, we may collect certain information such as the sign-in service used and a unique identification code associated with the sign-on service.</p>
<p>From time-to-time, our Online Games and Services may also contain functionality which enables you to import profile information or contacts from third party services (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, FourSquare, Instagram, Vine, etc.) (collectively, "<strong>Third Party Social Media Accounts</strong>"). If you choose to do this, you may have to log into the applicable Third Party Social Media Account, using such account’s user name and password. The copy of the information received by us shall be subject to this Privacy Statement. However, any data maintained by such third party service and your use of that third party service will be subject to that third party’s terms of use and privacy policy. You may have the ability to post information from our Online Games and Services to your Third Party Social Media Accounts (including, without limitation, by taking advantages of features such as the Facebook "like" button appearing on our Online Games and Services). All such postings are also subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of the applicable third parties as well as the terms of this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>The relevant legal basis under European law (where applicable) when processing your personal data for these purposes is our legitimate interest to guarantee the stability and security of our Online Games and Services, provide, manage and optimize our products and services (including our Online Games and Services), improve your experience while using our Online Games and Services, promote our products and services, provide customer support, develop new products and services, better understand users and their preferences, and measure and manage the frequency of our ads.</p>
<strong>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</strong>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> In the course of doing business, we employ other companies and individuals to perform a variety of functions on our behalf. For example, we may provide your information to companies that host our Online Games and Services or process credit card information. These service providers may have access to personal data about you if it is needed to perform their functions for us, but they are not authorized by KingsIsle to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements, and they are required to maintain the information in confidence.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Media.</strong> As discussed in the "Interaction with Sign-In Services and Social Media Accounts" section above, you may have the ability to share information from our Online Games and Services to your Third Party Social Media Accounts. Online Games and Services that allow you to do this use social plugins (e.g., the Facebook "Like" button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit our Online Games and Services, the operator of the social plugin can place a cookie on your computer, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Online Games and Services. If you are logged into the Third Party Social Media Account (e.g., Facebook) while browsing on our Online Games and Services, the social plugins allow that social media websites to receive information that you have visited our Online Games and Services. The social plugins also allow the social media website to share information about your activities on our Online Games and Services with other users of their social media website. For example, Facebook Social Plugins allows Facebook to show your Likes and comments on our Online Games and Services to your Facebook friends.</li>
	<li><strong>Online Partners</strong>. Please see the " <em>Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies by Our Online Partners</em>" section above.</li>
	<li><strong>Legally Required.</strong> We reserve the right to disclose information if required to do so by law or by a regulatory authority. We may also disclose your information as part of an investigation or enforcement action relating to improper or illegal conduct in connection with our Online Games and Services, including, without limitation, any situations that may potentially involve threats to the safety or privacy of any person, misuse of Online Games and Services or violation of our Terms of Use.</li>
	<li><strong>Sale or Bankruptcy.</strong> During the normal course of our business, KingsIsle may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal data provided through our Online Games and Services in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.</li>
	<li><strong>Aggregated and Non-Personal Data.</strong> KingsIsle may maintain aggregate data or other non-personal data about you, such as usage statistics, online traffic patterns and user feedback. In addition to using this information for the purposes discussed above, KingsIsle may disclose this information to third parties without restriction.</li>
</ul>
<strong>SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN</strong><br>
<strong>Users in the United States</strong>
<p>Except as described below, KingsIsle will not ask children under the age of 13 who register to use our Online Games and Services hereafter to submit any personal data. The only information requested from children under 13 will be a username and a user password. We may also ask such users to answer one or more security questions that do not request personal data. PLEASE NOTE: it is critical that users under the age of 13 retain their passwords because KingsIsle may not be able to reset the passwords when we have not collected a user or parental e-mail address.</p>
<p>If it becomes necessary to collect personal data from children under 13, KingsIsle will only do so after obtaining verifiable parental consent, as defined under COPPA, or as otherwise permitted under COPPA. For example, COPPA permits collection of personal data where (i) the sole purpose of collecting online contact information from a child is to respond directly on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child, and where such information is not used to re-contact the child or for any other purpose; (ii) the purpose of collecting a child’s and a parent’s name and online contact information is to protect the safety of a child; or (iii) KingsIsle collects online contact information of the child’s parent or guardian to obtain parental consent or to provide voluntary notice and/or updates to the parent or guardian about participation in our Online Games and Services.</p>
<p>On our Online Games and Services, we offer many features, such as the ability to view or download game content or images, news, or participate in forums, which do not require a child to provide any personal data. KingsIsle will not condition a child’s participation in any online activity on the child’s disclosure of more personal data than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. We also may enable users to chat online through our Online Games and Services, but we take measures to limit users’ ability to communicate personal data through this chat function.</p>
<strong>Parental Review of Personal Data</strong>
<p>In certain circumstances on some of our Online Games and Services, parents will have the ability to set up parental accounts to administer their children’s accounts and review the personally data maintained by KingsIsle from such accounts. Parents or guardians may establish a parental account during the initial registration process for the child’s account or, subsequently, through the account management features applicable to the child’s account. Although a child over the age of 13 may register without the electronic consent of a parent or guardian, a parent or guardian may also submit a request to KingsIsle at the contact information below to review any personally data from such child. However, such requests will be subject to the parent or guardian demonstrating proper identification to KingsIsle’s satisfaction after reasonable investigation</p>
<strong>Users located in Europe</strong>
<p>If you reside in Europe, you must be at least 16 years old to use our Online Games and Services.

If you believe that a minor of whom you are a parent or guardian has provided us with personal data, please contact us at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:Privacy@KingsIsle.com">Privacy@KingsIsle.com</a> and we will make reasonable efforts to remove all personal related to the minor.</p>

When you follow a link and leave our Online Games and Services, you do so at your own risk because we do not control such third-party websites.</p>
<strong>RETAINING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>
<p>We generally retain personal data for as long as needed for the specific business purpose or purposes for which it was collected.
