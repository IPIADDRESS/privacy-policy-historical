<h2>Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc. Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We have created this Privacy Statement to explain the privacy practices for the pioneerelectronics.com Web site, and to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy.</p>

<p><b>What Information About Customers Does Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc. Collect?</b></p>

<p>The information we learn from you helps us personalize and improve your shopping and viewing experience at pioneerelectronics.com. The following are the types of information we gather.</p>

<ul style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px">
<li><b>Information You Give Us:</b> We receive and store information you choose to enter on our web site and use it to provide you with the information, products and services you are interested in receiving. If you wish to sign up for email newsletters, purchase and/or register Pioneer products, or download product manuals, you will need to set up an account. When you set up an account, you will provide your name, mailing address and e-mail address, and create a password. Actual purchases will also require payment and delivery information. During the registration or account set-up process, or at other places on the web site, you may have the opportunity to indicate areas about which you would like to receive more information. We use this information to offer you a variety of benefits, such as notification of special offers we think you'll find valuable. You may also be asked whether you would like to participate in future surveys. Participation in any of these programs is, of course, at your option, and you may opt out later if you change your mind.</li>

<li><b>Automatic Information:</b> We automatically receive and record certain types of information whenever you interact with us. This information, which is recordable any time you use the Internet, includes the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your domain name, and computer and connection information such as browser type and version. We use this information to learn how you use the site, to remember your visits, and to diagnose problems. In addition, like many Web sites, we use a technology called "cookies" to record your activity while visiting the Web site. A number of companies and browsers offer utilities designed to block the passage of automatic information or the use of cookies. Although these utilities will prevent you from having a personalized experience at pioneerelectronics.com, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. Additionally, "pixel tags" (lines of code also known as clear GIFs) are placed selectively on this website and in advertisements that link to it to analyze general usage patterns of visitors. These pixel tags are programmed to collect only non-personally identifiable information. We also use pixel tags in email announcements sent to opt-in recipients to measure, as a whole, the level of interest in the announcements.</li>

<li><b>E-mail Communications:</b> We would like to set up a two-way dialogue with our customers through the use of e-mail. We hope to provide you with useful and interesting information on new technologies and also provide you a channel for feedback. You are in control of this dialogue. If at any time you wish to remove your e-mail address from Pioneer's e-mail list, you can do so by selecting the opt-out option in a Pioneer e-mail, or updating "My Account" online.</li>

<li><b>Links &amp; Forums:</b> To better serve you, we provide you with external links to other sites which we believe can offer you useful information and services. Pioneer is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these Web sites. Public forums such as chat rooms, message boards, and/or news groups may also be made available to visitors to our site. Pioneer encourages you to remember that information disclosed in public forums is public information, and caution should be exercised when disclosing personal information.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>More Information About Cookies</b></p>

<p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable us to personalize your Web browsing experience, including allowing our system to record your logon and password. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take advantage of several features on the pioneerelectronics.com Web site, and we recommend that, in order to benefit from these features, you leave them turned on.</p>

<p><b>Does Pioneer Share My Personal Information?</b></p>

<p>Pioneer does not sell or rent your individual information to third-party marketers, data collection companies or any other entities. Pioneer shares individual information with selected fulfillment companies solely to fulfill your requests, including purchases, and to provide consent-based marketing support. Each company is required to keep the information confidential and secure and to use it only for the limited purpose for which we share it. Pioneer may also disclose individual information if required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or similar legal process. In the unlikely event that Pioneer, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information may be one of the transferred assets. Aggregated (consolidated) demographic information which does not reveal individual information may be shared with third party advertisers to describe our online customer base. This information is purely statistical in nature and cannot be tied to the individuals who provided the data.</p>

<p><b>How Is The Collected Information Protected?</b></p>

<p>We use state-of-the-art technology to protect your data from unauthorized third parties. Currently pioneerelectronics.com uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect your personal data. SSL encrypts personal information as it is transmitted over the Internet. Pioneer uses firewalls between its internal network and the Web to allow only clearly defined traffic to access specific services. Network servers are protected by both physical and system level security in a data center facility made accessible on a need-to-know basis using unique IDs. The Program Website is registered with a site identification authority that enables your browser to confirm our identity before you send any information. During the registration and checkout process, Pioneer uses a server ID (or a digital certificate) together with industry-standard 128-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect sensitive customer information during both transmission and storage. You can confirm the presence of security measures when transmitting data through your security-enabled browser by looking for:</p>

<ul style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 20px">
<li>A URL beginning with "https://" rather than "http://"</li>

<li>If you're using Microsoft Internet Explorer® or Mozilla Firefox®, a closed lock icon at the bottom of the browser window.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>How Do I Learn More About The Information Collected?</b></p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the information collected about you, please write us at the following address: Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc., Attn: Internet Team, 2265 East 220th Street, Long Beach, CA 90810. As Pioneer continues to upgrade and enhance its Web sites, our commitment to your Privacy remains paramount. Questions regarding this Privacy Statement can be directed to: privacy@pioneer-usa.com</p>

<p><b>Changes To Privacy Policies</b></p>

<p>Pioneer reserves the right to change its privacy policies at any time. Please look for notices on the Privacy Policy link on Pioneer's home page for periodic updates.</p>

<p><b>Links to External Sites</b></p>

<p>Any external (non-Pioneer) websites to which we provide links will be subject to their own privacy policies and practices, and you will need to review those policies. Pioneer is not responsible for the practices of such sites.</p>
