            <h1>Online Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>oGorgeous Inc.” (the “Company”) respects the privacy concerns of the users of its website, www.piit28.com, the services provided therein (the “Site”), and the PIIT Pocket App (the "App"). The Company thus provides this privacy statement to explain what information is gathered during a visit to the Site and/or the App and how such information may be used.</p>
<p>Please also review the Terms of Use at www.piit28.com which also govern use of this Site.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Information:</strong> As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, or e-mail address, is automatically collected from your visit to the Site and/or the App. However, certain non-personal information is recorded by the standard operation of the Company’s internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your IP address is gathered in order to enhance your online experience.</p>
<p>The Site’s and/or the App's various mailing lists, downloads, special offers, contests, registration forms, and surveys may request that you give us contact information such as your name, mailing and/or e-mail address, demographic information such as your age and gender, and personal preference information such as your preferred software and interests. Information submitted at the time of submission will be used by the Company only as necessary for our legitimate business interests, including without limitation the improvement of our products, services and the contents of the Site. The Company may also share such information with our business and promotional partners to further those interests. Personally identifiable information is never sold or leased to any third parties. With your permission, we may use your contact information to send you information about our company and products. You may always opt-out of receiving future mailings as provided below. The Company does not store any credit card information it may receive in regard to a specific transaction and/or billing arrangement except as necessary to complete and satisfy its rights and obligations with regard to such transaction, billing arrangement, and/or as otherwise authorized by a user.</p>
<p>The Company may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with the Company’s rights or property, other users of the Site and/or the App, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>
