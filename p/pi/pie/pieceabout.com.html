Privacy Policy </h1>
<div id="static">
        <p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p>

<p>Piece About sees great importance in protecting your privacy. Our 
Privacy Policy is designed to explain the manner in which Piece About collects, uses, and discloses personal information provided by you as a 
result of the use of the Piece About Web Site and the content, information
 and services provided throughout the Site.</p>

<p><strong>USER'S CONSENT</strong></p>

<p>BY ACCESSING THIS WEB SITE, THE WEB SITE LOCATED AT THE URL PieceAbout.com AND/OR ANY OTHER SITE PROVIDED BY Piece About (COLLECTIVELY, THE "SITE"), YOU ARE SIGNIFYING, EXPRESSING AND PROVIDING
 YOUR CONSENT TO THE INFORMATION COLLECTION, INFORMATION USAGE, AND 
OTHER PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN THE PRIVACY POLICY BELOW. Piece About reserves the right to change this policy at any time, without notice, by
 posting a new privacy policy at this location. The collection, use and 
disclosure of your personal information by the Site will be governed by 
the version of this Policy in effect at that time. Please check this 
page periodically for any changes. Please contact us if you have any 
questions about our privacy policy.</p>

<p><strong>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>In order for you to access certain materials or pages (i.e. author 
signup, tell a friend, and the like) to register as a user on this Site,
 this Site requires that you provide certain personal information, 
including, but not limited to, your name, phone number and e-mail 
address. We use this information in order to contact you to provide you 
with further information about our company and services, as well as for 
other commercial and/or internal purposes such as market research in 
order to better understand the demographics of our Site visitors and 
potential customers and partners. We may share this information with our
 authorized partners and/or with third parties who act for or on behalf 
of us, but we do not otherwise provide or sell any information gathered 
on this Site to outside vendors.</p>

<p><strong>USER TRACKING</strong></p>

<p>This Site implements a user tracking feature, whereby the activities 
of each unique visitor to the Site are monitored. This is done 
regardless of whether the visitor has registered on the Site or is 
visiting the Site anonymously, but if you do not register on this Site 
or fill in your personal details on any forms, you do remain anonymous 
and we do not discover your identity. If you do register on this Site, 
our use of user tracking enables us to identify your future and prior 
activity on the Site, including your activity before you registered. 
This includes pages on our Site that you visited. User tracking also 
allows us to determine through which means you have reached our Site 
(i.e. which search engines or links) up to one web page back. The 
purpose of our user tracking is to analyze our visitors' actions in 
order to improve the user experience of visitors to our Site, as well as
 to better understand the priorities and interests of our potential 
customers and partners in order to better suit their needs and increase 
the efficiency of our sales and marketing processes.</p>

<p><strong>USE OF COOKIES</strong></p>

<p>A "cookie" is a small text file transferred by a Web Site to a 
computer that is browsing the Web Site. Even if you do not register on 
this Site, upon your first visit to this Site (or subsequent visits if 
you delete the cookie), a cookie is stored on your computer, which 
automatically identifies you to the Site. This is done for several 
technical reasons, including enabling the "User Tracking" described 
above. In addition, for your convenience, the cookie can "autofill" 
information on forms on the Site, removing the need for you to fill out 
the same information on our registration forms each time you want to 
access information that requires registration. However, cookies by 
themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user; the only
 personal information we learn about you is that which you provide to 
us, as described above. If you would prefer not to receive cookies, you 
can change the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. In 
addition, you can delete any cookies that have already been placed on 
your computer.</p>

<p><strong>INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESSES</strong></p>

<p>We collect the IP addresses of all visitors to our Site. We use your 
IP address in order to administer the Site, help diagnose problems with 
our server, gather broad demographic information, and for the "User 
Tracking" described above.</p>

<p><strong>HYPERLINKS</strong></p>

<p>This Site contains hyperlinks to other web sites. This privacy policy
 applies only to this Site and not to any other sites, including sites 
accessed by hyperlink from this Site. Piece About has no responsibility, 
liability for, or control over those other web sites or Internet 
resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your personal 
information, nor has it any control over the privacy policies of any of 
these sites. When you leave our Site, including by linking from the Site
 to another site, you should read the privacy policy, if any, provided 
by such site.</p>

<p>Piece About will accumulate and process your personal information in 
the USA  from time to time, in other locations at its discretion in 
order to provide you with competent and effective service.</p>

<p>In order to assist in protecting the confidentiality of your personal
 information, Piece About applies appropriate security safeguards in which
 to secure your sensitive information. However, in light of the nature 
of Internet technologies, security and privacy risks cannot be 
eliminated and, therefore, Piece About cannot guarantee that your personal
 information will not be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in 
this Policy.</p>
