			personal information. In connection with other activities, such as 
			subscribing to periodic mailings offered on the Site or registering 
			software, PC Doc Pro may ask you to provide certain information 
			about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is 
			completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you 
			select to engage in these activities, however, PC Doc Pro may ask 
			that you provide us personal information, such as your first and 
			last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, 
			employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers,

			processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors 
			(e.g. credit card merchant services) of PC Doc Pro. Such vendors
