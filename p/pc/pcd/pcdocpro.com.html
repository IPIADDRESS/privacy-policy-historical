			<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Win Doc Pro values the

			<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">We only collect

			collect billing and personal information necessary to sell you 
			software from our Site. To provide effective technical support in an 
			efficient manner, we ask for contact information allowing us to 
			research the problem and respond. Information that you provide to us 
			in the course of resolving technical issues is never shared with 
			anyone outside of Win Doc Pro and is only used internally to improve 
			our products and refine our future product plans. We give you the 
			opportunity to sign up to receive specific e-mail notifications for

			<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">As a visitor to this 
			Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any 
			personal information. In connection with other activities, such as 
			subscribing to periodic mailings offered on the Site or registering 
			software, Win Doc Pro may ask you to provide certain information 
			about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is 
			completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you 
			select to engage in these activities, however, Win Doc Pro may ask 
			that you provide us personal information, such as your first and 
			last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, 
			employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, 
			and other personal information. When ordering products or services 
			on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. 
			Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you 
			to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you 
			do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular 
			activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.<br>
			<br>
			When you use the Site, Win Doc Pro may also collect certain 
			technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate 
			your use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log 
			environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU 
			speed, and the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of your computer. We 
			use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use 
			of the Site and its services. Win Doc Pro also uses such 
			environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site and 
			to refine the Site to provide the best possible user experience. 
			Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we 
			do not match such information with any of your personal information.
			</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">When you submit 
			personal information to Win Doc Pro through this Site, you 
			understand and agree that this information may be transferred across 
			national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the

			maintain offices, including, without limitation, the United States. 
			You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to 
			certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and 
			processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors 
			(e.g. credit card merchant services) of Win Doc Pro. Such vendors 
			are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their 
			own purposes or provide it to any third parties. One instance where 
			this could occur is in conjunction with development and support for 
			localized and internationalized versions of our Site. </font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Win Doc Pro has 
			established relationships with various service providers whose 
			services are available to you from this Site or from Web sites that 
			are linked to this Site. Typically, these providers offer services 
			that Win Doc Pro customers might find useful, such as those that can 
			be used in conjunction with Win Doc Pro services and products. In 
			order to use those services, you may be required to provide personal 
			information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the 
			contrary, personal information that you provide while you are 
			visiting a provider’s Web site will be subject to the privacy policy 
			posted on such site, and personal information that you provide while 
			on this Site in conjunction with a provider’s service will be 
			subject to this Privacy Policy. </font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">You should be aware 
			that our agreements with these service providers often provide that 
			they will share with Win Doc Pro personal information collected from 
			you. In such instances, Win Doc Pro may use this information in a 
			manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In the situation where 
			sites have a Win Doc Pro “look and feel,” and you reasonably believe 
			you are on a Win Doc Pro site, the site is collecting information in 
			a solely intermediary capacity and does not use personal information 
			for secondary purposes. </font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>How your personal

			<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Win Doc Pro collects

			use of the software you have registered. If you register a product, 
			for example, the information is used to register your rights, if 
			any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made 
			available to registered users. As another example, if you enter a 
			contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact 
			you regarding the contest or prize awards. Your personal information 
			is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, special 
			offers, and other products and services of Win Doc Pro and selected 
			third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.
			<br>
			<br>
			Win Doc Pro may collect information about the use of the Site, such 
			as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. 
			This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying 
			any user individually. Win Doc Pro may use this aggregate, 
			non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, 
			marketing, or similar promotional purposes. </font></p>

			<p align="left"><b><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Protection of your

			<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The personal

			Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you 
			to your Registration Information is available through a password and 
			unique e-mail address selected by you. This password is encrypted. 
			We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In 
			addition, your Registration Information resides on a secure server 
			that only selected Win Doc Pro personnel and contractors have access 
			to via password. Win Doc Pro encrypts your personal information and 
			thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such 
			information when it is transmitted to Win Doc Pro </font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Personal information 
			that you provide that does not constitute Registration Information 
			also resides on a secure server and is only accessible to selected 
			Win Doc Pro personnel and contractors via password. Since this 
			information is not accessible by you, you will not be asked to 
			select a password in order to view or modify such information. <br>
			Please note that any information you post to a public bulletin board 
			or chat room is available to all persons accessing that location. 
			Although we may provide links to user groups and chat rooms that 
			discuss Win Doc Pro products as a convenience to our customers, we 
			do not control the content or privacy policies of those forums. Your 
			e-mail address will not automatically be posted on the forums unless 
			you permit that. Your e-mail address would then be available to all 
			persons accessing the forums. In addition, you should be aware that 
			the Forums offers a service in which subscribers are e-mailed a copy 
			of all messages posted to the forums on a particular topic. 
			Consequently, if you post a message to the forums, your e-mail 
			address will be sent to those subscribers that have indicated an 
			interest in the topic of your message. </font></p>
