                  being your name, birth date, email address, mailing address,

                <p>In general, you can visit our Web site without telling us who 
                  you are or providing any information about yourself. In some 
                  areas of the Web site, programs have been designed to perform 
                  specific functions for you directly though our Web site. Within 
                  these programs we may ask you to provide information that will 
                  enable us to process an order, offer services that require registration, 
                  assist you with technical support issues or to follow up with 
                  you. In some instances the information may include personal 
                  data. </p>
                <p>This privacy policy applies to information submitted by you 
                  and/or collected online by us except through PROMPT, the Church 
                  Leadership Connection, and student financial aid programs.</p>
                <p><b>Your Consent.</b> By using this Web site, you consent to 
                  our use of your personal data as described in this privacy policy.</p>
                <p><b>Notification Of Changes To This Policy.</b> We are continually 
                  improving and adding new functionality and features to this 
                  Web site. Because of these ongoing changes, changes in the law, 
                  and the changing nature of technology, we may revise this privacy 
                  policy from time to time. If and when the policy changes, we 
                  will post a dated notice on our home page informing you that 
                  a change has been made.</p>
                <p><b>Use of Personal Data Collected Through This Web Site.</b> 
                  Information, including but not limited to personal data, that 
                  we collect will not be sold, rented, lent, exhanged or used 
                  by an individual or entity other than the Presbyterian Church 
                  (U.S.A.) ("PCUSA") entities and governing bodies of 
                  the PCUSA unless otherwise indicated. This includes, for example, 
                  the information you provide when you register for an event or 
                  conference, order resource materials, request other services, 
                  or when you send us your comments or requests for information.</p>
                <p>We use the information you provide for the purposes for which 
                  it was originally collected, for example, to respond to your 
                  email or to provide the programs or services you requested. 
                  We may also use this information to help us improve the content 
                  and functionality of our Web site, to better understand the 
                  needs and interests of the people and organizations that use 
                  our Web site, and to improve our programs and services. This 
                  information may be used to contact you in the future to tell 
                  you about organizations within the PCUSA, programs and services.</p>
                <p>Unless we have your permission or are otherwise required by 
                  law to release, the personal data provided by you online will 
                  be shared only with other PC(USA) entities and governing bodies 
                  to enable them to contact you regarding services, benefits, 
                  or mission opportunities; with other third parties who act on 
                  our behalf to further process or analyze the data or protect 
                  the security or integrity of our databases or this Web site; 
                  and with our successors in interest through corporate merger, 
                  reorganization, dissolution or similar event. In the event of 
                  a release to a PC(USA) entity or third party described above, 
                  your personal data will not be released until the PC(USA) entity, 
                  governing body, or third party has agreed in writing to be bound 
                  by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>We, and others with whom we share your personal data, may retain 
                  your personal data on file to better serve you. Any destruction 
                  of personal data will be done in a manner consistent with the 
                  intent of this policy.</p>
                <p><b>Anonymous Data Collected Through PC(USA) Web Site.</b> In 
                  addition to the information you provide when you use this Web 
                  site, we use technology to collect anonymous information about 
                  the use of the Web site. For example, we use technology to track 
                  how many visitors access the Web site, the date and time of 
                  their visit, the length of their stay, and which pages they 
                  view. We also use technology to determine which Web browsers 
                  our visitors use and the address from which they accessed the 
                  site.</p>
                <p>This technology does not identify you personally. It simply 
                  enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their 
                  use of our Web site. We use this anonymous data and may share 
                  it with third parties for various reasons; for example, to improve 
                  the content and functionality of the Web site, to better understand 
                  the needs and interests of our visitors, to improve our programs 
                  and services.</p>
                <p><b>Cookies.</b> In order to collect the anonymous data described 
                  in the preceding paragraph, we may use temporary "cookies" 
                  that collect the first level domain name of the user. For example, 
                  if your email address is "name@xyz.com," the cookie 
                  collects the "xyz.com" portion of your email address 
                  and the date and time you accessed this Web site. Cookies by 
                  themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. 
                  A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your 
                  browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do 
                  not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify 
                  you when you receive a cookie. This enables you to decide if 
                  you want to accept it or not. Our Web site only uses temporary 
                  or "session" cookies. These "session" cookies 
                  expire when your browser window is closed.</p>
                <p> In order for certain applications on the pcusa.org Web site 
                  to function properly, if at all, it is necessary for your computer 
                  to accept cookies.</p>

                  from children under the age of thirteen. If you are under thirteen, 
                  please do not give us any personal data. If you have reason

                  we develop online programs for children, we will adopt appropriate 
                  policies and practices to protect the privacy of children.</p>
