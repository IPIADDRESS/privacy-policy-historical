      <h2>Privacy&nbsp;Policy</h2>
     
        <p>Are you concerned about your privacy? Doing business together requires some sharing of information. Set out below is our Privacy Policy, explaining what information we collect and why, what we do with it and how we protect you.</p>
        <h2>What information we collect and why</h2>
        <p><strong>Registration, download and purchase</strong></p>
        <p>To access certain areas of the SoftCity.com website (especially to download or to buy), you will first be asked to complete a form to either download a trial version, a free software title, or to create an account before buying any of our products.</p>
        <p><strong>Registration</strong></p>
        <p>During registration, you may be required to provide your contact information, such as your name, email address, postal address, payment information and to choose a password. Your email address is your username. We send all newly registered users a welcoming email to verify their password and username.</p>
        <p>It’s very important that you submit a working email address because that is where we’ll send your purchase confirmation, download links, activation keys, support and product notices.</p>
        <p><strong>Purchase</strong></p>
        <p>When buying a product on the site, you will be asked for your contact details and billing and, if applicable, shipping information. This data will be used to process the order, to get the payment through the credit card verification process, and to ship any item(s) you ordered. If there is a problem with the order, a SoftCity representative may contact you by email. A confirmation email is sent for each purchase to the address you give us - so if you have a few addresses take a moment to remember which one you give us.</p>
        <p><strong>Download</strong></p>
        <p>When downloading a trial version or a free software program, you will be asked for contact information, including your email address. You will receive email messages related to this transaction such as to provide you with download links, activation keys, support notices and upgrades for the software.</p>
        <p><strong>Surveys and contests</strong></p>
        <p>From time to time, we request information from SoftCity.com users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. This information is mainly used to better understand our audience and to send prizes to the winners when needed. Should the results of a contest or a survey be published, no personal information will be divulged without the explicit consent of the winners.</p>
        <h2>What we do with it</h2>
        <p><strong>Your subscription to SoftCity Newsletters and Special Offers</strong></p>
        <p>When submitting your email address, you are given the opportunity to "opt-in" to the SoftCity newsletter. By opting to receive this communication, SoftCity will send you regular emails containing relevant product and service information, new product and upgrade information, and any special offers that we think may be relevant to you.</p>
        <p><strong>If you wish to unsubscribe from the newsletter</strong></p>
        <p>If at any time you wish to opt-out from these communications, please follow the unsubscribe link contained in the emails, or email us with your request to be removed from our mailing list.</p>
        <p>When you officially “unsubscribe” through our links or site we commit to remove the email address from our mailing lists as soon as possible, and usually before the next mailing. From that point you will no longer receive our newsletters or special offers. However, please take note that if you purchased software or downloaded trial versions in the past or if you decide to purchase or download a trial version again after you’ve unsubscribed, we may still send you service emails directly related to these transactions, such as order confirmations, product notices, expiry notifications, bug fix notifications, security alerts, compatibility notifications, or enhancements.</p>
        <p><strong>No sharing of information to preserve your privacy</strong></p>
        <p>SoftCity is the sole owner of information collected on its websites. We will not sell, disclose, or rent this information to others except if required to by contract or through a legal proceeding or law.</p>
