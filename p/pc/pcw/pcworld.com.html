<div class="formTitle">PCWorld.com Privacy Policy</div>
<div class="clear"><!-- For IE --></div>
<p>At PC World, we understand that privacy is important, and we've
created this policy to give you information about how we collect and use
personal information. Our policy is divided into three main sections:
Section 1 describes how we collect and use data from users of the PC
World Web site. Section 2 describes how we collect and use data from
subscribers to the print and electronic editions of PC World magazine.
And because PC World is owned by International Data Group (IDG) and is
part of the IDG Publishing Network of technology publications, Section 3
presents the privacy policy for the IDG Publishing Network.</p>
<p>We reevaluate this policy on an ongoing basis, and we value your
feedback. If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy
policy, we ask that you contact us at:</p>
<blockquote>Customer Service<br>
PC World Communications, Inc.<br>
501 Second Street<br>
San Francisco, CA 94107<br>
e-mail: <a href="mailto:webmaster@pcworld.com">webmaster@pcworld.com</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We
will post the new policy on this page, and, if the changes allow us to
use personally identifying information in ways that are different from
the ways specified at the time the information was originally collected,
our Web site will contain a special notice about the changes. Each
version of this privacy policy will be identified by its effective date,
which you can find at the bottom of the page.</p>

<a name="info"></a>
<h3>1. PC World Online Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>PC World collects data, including personally identifying information,
from people who use the PC World Web site. This section of our privacy
policy explains how we collect and use this data. Please note that PC
World subscriber data is maintained separately from data gathered from
our online users. This means that users of the PC World Web site who
also subscribe to PC World magazine, in either print or electronic form,
should read both this section and Section 2 (PC World Subscriber Privacy
Policy) in order to have a full understanding of our privacy practices.</p>

<h4>Information we collect and how we use it</h4>
<p>When you visit the PC World Web site, PC World collects several forms
of usage data, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Log data. Our servers automatically record certain information sent
	by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol
	address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the
	date and time of your request.</li>
	<li>Cookie data. When you visit the PC World Web site, PC World or one
	of our IDG affiliates or third-party partners may send one or more
	"cookies"—small files containing a string of characters—to your
	computer to identify you as a unique user. If you have registered with
	PC World, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more
	personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to
	customize portions of the site. If you haven't registered, the cookie
	identifies you as a unique user and helps ensure a smoother experience
	on the site, such as by limiting the number of times that you see
	certain subscription offers. If you have not registered on our site, we
	cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying
	information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.</li>
	<li>Traffic and advertising data. Other cookies without personally
	identifying information and data are used to enable PC World to gather
	and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our
	advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented. These
	cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as
	clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying
	information, but they may gather information about what sites you have
	visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you
	visit the PC World site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of
cookies while you surf our site. Or you can use third-party anonymizer
services to mask information in your cookies or even general data such
as your IP address. In such cases you would not be able to take
advantage of most of the personalization services offered on the PC
World Web site.</p>
<p>The aggregated information we collect is used for a number of
purposes including the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To improve the content and design of the PC World Web site.</li>
	<li>To enable our audit bureau to verify our claims of traffic to the
	site.</li>
	<li>To help advertisers, potential advertisers or marketers assess the
	suitability of the site for their ad campaigns.</li>
	<li>To help us understand more about the interests of our users, so
	that we can offer goods and services we believe may be of interest.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many portions of the PC World site can be used without registering or
giving us any personal information such as (but not limited to) your
name and e-mail address. However, PC World does collect personally
identifying information regarding our online users, including in the
following ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>When you provide it to us, such as (but not limited to) by entering
	a contest, becoming a registered member, signing up for a newsletter or
	tutorial, or otherwise contacting us.</li>
	<li>When you provide it to a company that powers a portion of our site
	or provides a special feature, such as a contest registration, that
	appears on our site.</li>
	<li>When you provide information about yourself or your company to PC
	World in connection with a subscription order, or when you provide
	information to any other IDG Publishing Network affiliate, that
	information may be included in your PC World user record, if one
	exists.</li>
	<li>If you have previously registered with another IDG Publishing
	Network affiliate and you begin to fill out certain forms on the PC
	World Web site, the site may recognize you and automatically complete
	the form, and this auto-fill data will then be included in your PC
	World user record.</li>
	<li>If you have provided information to PC World, from time to time we
	may enhance that information with other information that we collect
	from third-party sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The personal information we collect may be used in a number of ways,
including the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To improve the content of the PC World site, including by allowing
	PC World's editors to consult with readers.</li>
	<li>To communicate with users about registration and other customer
	service issues.</li>
	<li>To promote products and services of PC World, our parent company
	IDG, and our sibling IDG companies, as described in more detail below.</li>
	<li>To conduct research surveys on behalf of PC World, IDG, and its
	subsidiaries and affiliates.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Information sharing</h4>
