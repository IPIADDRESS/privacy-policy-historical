				<p>Direct your inquiries regarding privacy to <a href="contact.asp">privacy@pct.edu</a>.</p>
			</div><img class="rfloat" src="images/privacy.jpg" alt="We respect your privacy." width="150" height="224">
			<p>We respect your privacy. Pennsylvania College of Technology is the sole owner of information collected on 
				this website. Any and all information collected via the Penn College website will be kept strictly confidential and will not be sold, reused, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed. Your information will be held with the utmost care, and will not be used in ways that you have not consented to.</p>
			<h3>Information Collection</h3>
			<p>Penn College collects information at several different points on our website 
				including, but not limited to:</p>
			<p><b>Student Information System (SIS) – </b>In order to use the SIS, you must first be assigned a personal identification 
				number by the Registrar which will be used, along with your student ID number, to log in. Information obtained via the SIS includes personal 
				information such as addresses and home information, student ID number, grades, 
				and account/billing information. You are encouraged to protect the privacy of your PIN and student ID number.</p>
			<p><b>Registrar – </b>The Registrar's Office requires a student's Social Security number for the 
				purposed of verifying the student's identity with official educational records. 
				If a Social Security number is not provided, the College cannot guarantee the 
				authenticity of educational records. The College will not disclose Social 
				Security numbers to anyone outside of the College without an individual's 
				consent except as mandated by law.</p>
			<p><b>Admissions – </b>We request information from the user on our Information Request form, as well 
				as our degree-seeking, non-degree-seeking, and returning student admissions applications. The data 
				requested by the Information Request form is used for recruitment purposes. The 
				data requested by the admissions application is used for enrollment and billing 
				purposes. An applicant may also choose to remit their application fee online. 
				This transaction is secured by VeriSign. The Office of Admissions also requests 
				advance registration for special events, such as Fall Visitation, Spring 
				Visitation, and Campus Tours; this information is used both for planning and 
				recruitment purposes.</p>
			<p><b>Financial Aid – </b>We request information from the user on our Financial Aid Application form. While your Social Security number is not 
				an admission requirement, it is required by the government in order for you to 
				be eligible for aid.</p>
			<p><strong>Scholarships</strong> <b>–</b> We request information from the user on our Scholarship Application form. Our scholarship applications are hosted by NextGen Web Solutions. Applicants use their student ID number and a unique password (not the student's Penn College network password or SIS PIN) to log in. This information is contained on a secure server at NextGen.</p>
			<p><b>Institutional Advancement – </b>We request information from the user on our Online Giving form. The data 
				requested by this form allows the user a more convenient, yet secure method of 
				giving to Penn College. We accept online payment via credit card; this 
				transaction is secured by Comodo. For those who wish to give to Penn College 
				without submitting sensitive information, we also provide a printable form that 
				can be mailed to the Foundation.</p>
			<p><b>Alumni Information Update – </b>Alumni Relations offers an Information Update form to maintain current contact information and supply information for <a href="/oca/classNotes.asp">Class Notes</a> published in <em>One College Avenue</em>. Alumni may elect to opt out of e-mail from the Alumni Relations office.</p>
			<p>We have also asked alumni, on occasion, to act as ambassadors for the 
				College, to appear and give testimony for our publications and website, and to 
				offer tours during College events such as Open Houses.</p>
			<p><b>"You're the Chef" – </b>We request information from the user when the user chooses to ask a question 
				of the Chef, and when the user chooses to submit an entry to our recipe contest. 
				This information is used to determine the demographics of our audience, as well 
				as to respond to questions, and to mail a prize to the winning entry of our 
				recipe contest.</p>
			<p>If a user elects to use our "Send this recipe to a friend" option for 
				informing a friend about a recipe, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail 
				address only. We will send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit 
				the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this 
				one-time-only e-mail.</p>
			<p><b>College Store – </b>The College contracts with CampusHub to provide online shopping cart 
				technology for purchases. The user's e-mail address will not be shared with 
				anyone, and the user will receive no correspondence unless it relates directly 
				to a question or order. CampusHub uses secure SSL technology to secure all 
				transactions.</p>
			<p><b>Workforce Development &amp; Continuing Education – </b>We accept online registrations for non-credit classes taught through our 
				Workforce Development &amp; Continuing Education office. The information is used 
				solely for registration purposes; we will not place the registrant on a mailing 
				list unless requested to do so. Also, because we accept credit card payment, 
				this site is secured by VeriSign.</p>
			<p><b>Wildcat Wishes – </b>We accept online orders for "Wildcat Wishes" student gift packages. 
				Information obtained is used for ordering and delivery purposes only. Neither 
				party's name will be placed on a mailing list. Credit card orders are protected, 
				since the site is secured by Comodo.</p>
			<p><b>Police – </b>We request information from the user on our Student Vehicle Registration form, including vehicle license and credit card information. This transaction is secured by Comodo. </p>
			<p><strong>Employee Directories</strong><b> – </b>While we do not sell or give out e-mail address information, that information is 
				available on our website for the convenience of our students and employees. We 
				do not publish a list of e-mail addresses.</p>
			<p><strong>Student Directories</strong> – Student record information is confidential and private. In accordance with both 
				federal law and College policy, the College does not release student record 
				information without prior written consent. The one exception to this is that the 
				College will release directory-type information, such as name, address, phone 
				number, date and place of birth, major, activity participation, date(s) of 
				attendance, enrollment status, grade level, date of graduation, 
				degrees/honors/awards, sports participation, and most recent educational 
				institution attended. Any student may request that directory information not be 
				released publicly by completing and signing an Authorization to Withhold 
				Directory Information, available from the Registrar's Office.</p>
			<p><strong>Student Home Pages</strong> – We periodically monitor student homepages for content, and will discontinue 
				hosting the home page of any student who is in violation of <a href="/its/policy.htm">Penn College's Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Cookies</strong> – A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive, and contains 
				information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any 
				personally identifiable information while on our site. The cookie we use will 
				stay on the user's hard drive. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use 
				our site with no limitations. Cookies on our site are used solely for the 
				purpose of tracking the progress of visitors to our site.</p>
			<p><strong>Log Files/IP Addresses</strong> – We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer 
				the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for 
				aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable 
				information.</p>
			<p><strong>Penn College Student E-mail Addresses (yourname@pct.edu)</strong> – We will not sell or give your Penn College e-mail 
				address to anyone, except in a searchable format on our website. If you wish to 
				be removed from our online searchable list, you may log onto Penn College's 
				student e-mail system and remove yourself from the directory.</p>
			<p><strong>Penn College Employee E-mail Addresses (yourname@pct.edu)</strong> – We will not sell or give your Penn College employee e-mail address to anyone, except in a searchable format on our website.</p>
			<p><strong>E-mail Addresses requested on forms</strong> – We request your e-mail address only to allow us to 
				respond to your messages, or to forward a confirmation to you. We do not sell or 
				give your e-mail address to anyone, and will not use it in any manner other than 
				that specified on each form.</p>
