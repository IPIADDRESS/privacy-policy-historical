				<h5>Feel your privacy's being invaded?</h5>
				<p>Direct your inquiries regarding privacy to <a href="contact.asp">privacy@pct.edu</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<section>
			<p>We respect your  privacy. Pennsylvania College of Technology is the sole owner of information  collected on this website. Any and all information collected via the Penn  College website will be kept strictly confidential and will not be sold,  reused, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed. Exceptions exist only as  mandated by law or required under a contractual relationship with a service  provider as allowed by Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). </p>
			<p> We may provide your personal  information to organizations that provide services to help us with our business  activities. These organizations are authorized to use your personal information  only as necessary to provide these services. In addition, we require all  outside organizations that we work with in any area of our organization,  including marketing and data processing, to maintain the confidentiality of  your information in accordance with this privacy policy and to comply with all  applicable laws.</p>
			<h2 id="Information">Information Collection</h2>
			<p>Penn College  collects information at several different points on our website including, but  not limited to:</p>
            <h5>Student Information System (SIS)</h5>
<p>You  will use your Penn College username and password to log in to SIS. Information  obtained via SIS includes personal information such as addresses and home  information, grades, and account/billing information. You are encouraged to  protect the privacy of your login credentials throughout your college career.  Sharing network usernames and passwords is a violation of <a href="/campuslife/its/policy.htm">Penn College's IT Resources Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</p>
			<h5>Registrar</h5>
			<p>The Registrar's  Office requires a student's Social Security number for the purpose of verifying  the student's identity with official educational records. If a Social Security  number is not provided, the College cannot guarantee the authenticity of  educational records. The College will not disclose Social Security numbers to  anyone outside of the College without an individual's consent except as  mandated by law.</p>
			<h5>Admissions</h5>
			<p>We  request information from the user on our Information Request form, as well as  our degree-seeking, non-degree-seeking, and returning student admissions  applications. The data requested by the Information Request form is used for  recruitment purposes. The data requested by the admissions application is used  for enrollment and billing purposes. An applicant may also choose to remit  their application fee online. This transaction is secured by VeriSign. The  Admissions Office also requests advance registration for special events, such  as Open House, Senior Visit Day, New Jersey Days, and Campus Tours; this  information is used both for planning and recruitment purposes.</p>
			<h5>Financial Aid </h5>
			<p>We request  information from the user on our Financial Aid Application form. While your Social  Security number is not an admission requirement, it is required by the  government in order for you to be eligible for aid.</p>
			<h5>Scholarships</h5>
			<p>We request  information from the user on our Scholarship Application form. Our scholarship  applications are hosted by NextGen Web Solutions. Applicants use their student  ID number and a unique password (not the student's Penn College network  password or SIS PIN) to log in. This information is contained on a secure  server at NextGen.</p>
			<h5>The Penn College Fund Donor Form</h5>
			<p>The College contracts with Blackbaud, Inc., of Charleston, SC, USA, a leading provider of technology solutions and services for nonprofit organizations, to provide The Penn College Fund online giving form. The Blackbaud Gateway safely processes all transactions and the Blackbaud Vault encrypts sensitive information to ensure all transactions are secure. The College has elected to not require user registration with Blackbaud from our donors, further ensuring your privacy. Neither the College nor Blackbaud will disclose or share financial information without your consent, except for general statistical purposes and certain explicit circumstances in which disclosure may be required by law. Your financial information will not be distributed or sold to third-party organizations. Read the <a href="https://www.blackbaud.com/privacy-policy.aspx" target="_blank">Blackbaud Privacy Policy</a> for more information. </p>
			<p>For those who wish to give to The Penn College Fund without submitting sensitive information online, we also provide a printable form that can be mailed to the Institutional Advancement Office.</p>
			<h5>Planned Giving</h5>
			<p>The College contracts with Crescendo Interactive, Inc., of Camarillo, CA, USA, to provide its GiftLegacy planned giving marketing and communications solutions to donors and prospective donors to Penn College. Neither the College nor Crescendo will disclose or share financial information without your consent, except for general statistical purposes and certain explicit circumstances in which disclosure may be required by law. Your financial information will not be distributed or sold to third-party organizations.</p>
			<p>Read <a href="http://www.pctgift.org/?pageID=98">Crescendo's privacy statement</a> for more information.</p>


<h5>Alumni Information Update</h5>
<p>Alumni  Relations offers an Information Update form to maintain current contact  information and supply information for <a href="//www.pct.edu/oca/classNotes.aspx">Class Notes</a> published in <em>One College Avenue</em>. Alumni may elect  to opt out of e-mail from the Alumni Relations office.</p>
<p>We have also  asked alumni, on occasion, to act as ambassadors for the College, to appear and  give testimony for our publications and website, and to offer tours during  College events such as Open Houses.</p>
<p>We do not share contact information with anyone outside the College without permission.</p>
<h5>"You're the Chef"</h5>
<p>We request  information from the user when the user chooses to ask a question of the Chef. This  information is used to determine the demographics of our audience, as well as  to respond to questions.</p>
<p>If a user elects to use our "Send this recipe to  a friend" option for informing a friend about a recipe, we ask them for  the friend's name and e-mail address only. We will send the friend a one-time  e-mail inviting them to visit the site. We store this information for the sole  purpose of sending this one-time-only e-mail.</p>
<h5>The College Store</h5>
			<p>The College contracts  with Missouri Bookstore to provide online shopping cart technology for purchases.  The user's e-mail address will not be shared with anyone, and the user will  receive no correspondence unless it relates directly to a question or order. Missouri  Bookstore uses secure SSL technology to secure all transactions.</p>
			<h5> Workforce  Development &amp; Continuing Education</h5>
			<p>We accept online registrations for noncredit  classes taught through our Workforce Development &amp; Continuing Education  office. The information is used solely for registration purposes. Also, because  we accept credit card payment, this site is secured.</p>
			<h5> Wildcat Wishes</h5>
			<p>We accept online orders  for "Wildcat Wishes" student gift packages. Information obtained is  used for ordering and delivery purposes only. Neither party's name will be  placed on a mailing list. Credit card orders are protected, since the site is  secured.</p>
			<h5>Police</h5>
			<p>We request information from the user on  our Student Vehicle Registration form, including vehicle license and credit  card information. This transaction is secured.</p>
			<h5>Employee  Directories</h5>
			<p>While we do  not sell or give out e-mail address information, that information is available  on our website for the convenience of our students and employees. We do not  publish a list of e-mail addresses.</p>
			<h5> Student  Directories</h5>
			<p>Student  record information is confidential and private. In accordance with both federal  law and College policy, the College does not publicly release student record  information without prior written consent. The one exception to this is that  the College will release directory-type information, such as name, address,  phone number, date and place of birth, major, activity participation, date(s)  of attendance, enrollment status, grade level, date of graduation,  degrees/honors/awards, sports participation, and most recent educational  institution attended. Any student may request that directory information not be  released publicly by completing and signing an Authorization to Withhold  Directory Information, available from the Registrar's Office.			</p>
			<h5>Site Search</h5>
			<p>The  College uses Google Custom Search for providing customized search results.  Submitted queries are not stored by the College; rather they are shared with  Google for processing. Use of the Google Custom Search on the College’s website  is governed by <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google’s privacy policy.</a></p>
			<h5>Cookies</h5>
			<p>A  cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive, and contains  information about the user. Use of a cookie on the College’s public website  (<a href="http://www.pct.edu">www.pct.edu</a>) is in no way linked to any personally identifiable  information while on our site. The cookie we use will stay on the user's hard  drive. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site with no  limitations. Cookies on our site are used solely for the purpose of tracking  the progress of visitors to our site.</p>
			<h5>Log Files/IP Addresses</h5>
			<p>We use  IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and  gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses accessing  the College’s public website are not linked to personally identifiable  information.</p>
			<h5>E-mail Addresses requested on forms</h5>
			<p>We  request your e-mail address only to allow us to respond to your messages, or to  forward a confirmation to you. We do not sell or give your e-mail address to  anyone for their personal use, and will not use it in any manner other than  that specified on each form.</p>
<h2 id="External">Links</h2>
			<p>This website  contains links to other sites, and these links are designed to open all external websites in a new browser window. Pennsylvania College of Technology is not  responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our  users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements  of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.</p>

			<h2 id="Notification">Notification of Change</h2>
			<p>The College will occasionally update this Statement. Those changes  will be posted to this page so our constituents are always aware of what  information is collected and how we use it. We encourage you to periodically  review this page for the latest information.</p>
