        , to provide Users with the most relevant experiences on our Website
        and versions of our mobile applications, including sweepstakes, games
        and ads, that we think are likely to be of interest to you.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Transactional Purposes</em>
        , to contact Users with our offers and promotions, to process entries
        and orders, to award tokens and prizes, to fulfill orders, to
        facilitate your interaction with the advertisers on whose ads you have
        clicked and whose surveys you may have taken.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Technical Purposes</em>
        , to provide notices, updates, security alerts and support information;
        to analyze usage trends in the aggregate; and to administer our
        Website. For mobile devices, we use analytics software to allow us to
        better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your
        phone or tablet. This software may record information such as how often
        you use the application, the events that occur within the application,
        aggregated usage, performance data and where the application was
        downloaded from.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Customer Service Purposes</em>
        , to communicate with you via SMS / email / direct mail about your
        entries, orders, payments and any other questions you may have.

        platforms, advertisers, publishers, the public domain and governmental
        and other public sources, as well as commercial data aggregators who
        collect data from businesses and other sources and make that data
        available to commercial users like PCH for a valuable consideration, or

        Engagement, Affinity and Demographic information to align you with
        others in relevant groups based on common characteristics, interests

</ul>
<h1>
    <a name="_How_does_such"></a>
    5. How does such third-party data-sharing occur?
</h1>
<p>
    We assign a unique generic user ID ("GUID") to each User. GUIDs are
    anonymized, and contain no personally-identifiable information. We use
    GUIDs to track and report on Users' engagement with our Website,
    transactions with us and any prizes, awards or other benefits to which they
    may be entitled. GUIDs may be shared with third-party advertiser to
    facilitate and report on a User's engagement with advertisements or offers
    from such third parties.
</p>
<p>
    We share a User's Google Advertising ID with application tracking companies
    so that they can track and report to us whether a User has viewed, clicked
    on our accepted an advertiser's offer or downloaded an advertiser's app.
</p>
<p>
    We use third-party service providers to verify a User's address, in order
    to ensure our commercial messages reach the intended User and to process
    any User orders prior to shipping, submit a list of User names and
    addresses to the third-party for
</p>
<p>
    We may provide User contact information and data to selected third-party
    advertisers and publishers to present offers directly to our Users that are
    geared towards their interests.
</p>
<p>
    Our applications may contain tools from third-party service providers that
    enable those third parties to collect and analyze non-personally
    identifiable information from Users' devices in accordance with such third
    parties' own privacy policies and subject to the legal requirements that
    apply to them.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a merger, acquisition or change of control of PCH, customer
    data would be considered a business asset and would be transferred. We will
    disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for
    example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose
    consumer data as required by law or to protect the safety and security of
    our Users.
</p>
<p>
    We will provide your name and address to the publisher of any magazine you
    order, or any item you order that is shipped to you directly by the seller,
    so they can fulfill your order. Such publishers or sellers may exchange or
    rent their subscriber and customer names, typically to third-parties with
    offers that align with User interests. If you do not wish to receive such
    offers, we suggest that you notify the publisher or seller directly, as PCH
    is not able to make such requests on your behalf.
</p>
<p>
    We use other third party vendors such as lettershops, e-mail service
    providers, credit card processors and fulfillment houses, to provide postal
    and e-mail delivery services, order processing and order fulfillment
    services. When you order or register on our Website, we may share your
    consumer data to enable these third parties to provide these services.
    These third parties are prohibited from using your consumer data for any
    other purpose including their own marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>
    When you register with our Website, we may share your name and information
    with third parties who may contact you with relevant offers. If you wish to
    opt out of such exchanges you may

    .
</p>
<p>
    We may share your personally identifiable information with our affiliates,
    our technical consultants, auditors, attorneys and other third parties who
    work with us to make our Website and services available.

    <a name="_What_are_Cookies"></a>
    6. What are Cookies and other tracking technologies?
</h1>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    PCH and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to recognize User
    access privileges to PCH, analyze trends, administer the website, track
    users’ movements around the website, add advertisements for goods or
    services we think may interest you, estimate our audience size, and to
    gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
</p>
<p>
    A cookie is a small data file that a website can send to the browser on
    your computer when you link to that website. A cookie can hold information
    deposited in the file by a website, which can then be read by other sites.
    A cookie is not a computer program, it does not extract personal
    information about you or from your computer and it does not read data on
    your hard drive or instruct your computer to perform any function.
</p>
<p>

    store, record or share any personal information about you. We utilize
    third-party internet service providers to collect site traffic data through

    7. Targeted or Behavioral Advertising:
</h1>
<p>
    Targeted (also known as Behavioral) Advertising uses information collected
    on a person's web browsing behavior (such as the pages they have visited or
    the searches they have made) to select relevant digital experiences and
    advertisements for display to that person on third-party websites. For
    example, if you have shown an interest in cooking while visiting PCH, you
    may be served an advertisement from PCH or a third-party advertiser for
    cooking-related products when you visit a website other than our Website.
    The information collected is linked only to an anonymous GUID; it does not
    include any information that could be linked back to a particular person,
    such as their name, address or credit card number.
</p>
<p>
    If you would like to opt out of Targeted Advertising, please
    <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=pch01" target="_blank">
        click here
    </a>
    . If you are accessing our promotions and content through our mobile apps,
    you may opt out of such targeted advertising by opening the menu options on
    our APP, clicking on “Ad Preferences” and completing your opt-out
    preferences as indicated.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that this will opt you out of targeted ads from PCH and any
    other participating advertisers. If you opt out, you will continue to
    receive online advertising from Publishers Clearing House; however, these
    ads won't be targeted and therefore may not be as relevant to you.
</p>
<h1>
    <a name="_Can_I_opt-out"></a>
    8. Can I opt-out of receiving email from PCH?
</h1>
<p>

    some or none of our email programs. If you are already receiving PCH
    promotional emails for one or more of our email programs, and no longer
    wish to receive such communications, simply follow the "unsubscribe"

    partners, and are receiving email communications directly from these third
    parties, PCH cannot in most instances unsubscribe you from these third
    party email programs. If you wish to unsubscribe from one of our marketing
