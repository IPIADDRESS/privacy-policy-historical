    <strong id="personalinfo">1. Why does PCH collect personal information?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We need to collect certain personal information from our visitors to process and fulfill online sweepstakes entries and online orders for the products and
    services we offer. For example, we need your full name, e-mail address and date of birth to verify eligibility and enter you in the sweepstakes, notify you
    if you've won a prize, to process any redemption activity and to fulfill any magazine subscription or product you may purchase. We may also use the
    personal data we collect for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes, to report aggregate information to our marketing partners and others and
    to help provide you more relevant and enjoyable visits to our site.
</p>
<p>
    Why does PCH collect information from a user's device? We need to collect certain device information so that we may ensure that you are being served the
    correct version of the app, so we are able to notify you that you have won a contest, so that we may determine which user has downloaded the application,
    users are then given a chance to win contests. We will collect the following information from a user's device Android Device ID, Operating System Version,
    Flash Version, Browser Type, Service Provider, Mobile Device Model, Screen Resolution, Language, Country, City, and Mobile input selector (touch screen,
    etc.)
</p>
<p>
    To provide our users with a more personalized and relevant web service, we may also collect and use personal data to identify users' specific interests and
    needs. If given permission, we may notify our users online or via email of offers and information we feel may be of interest to them available from PCH.
    Our online registration and entry page contains a clearly identified checked box indicating that by submitting the form you wish to receive offers from
    PCH. Users may unsubscribe from such offers by clicking to remove the check in the permission notice box before submitting the registration and entry form.
</p>
<p>
    We may share our unsubscribe list with select marketing partners for the sole purpose of insuring that individuals on this list do not receive electronic
    commercial mail messages containing Publishers Clearing House promotions and advertisements that may be sent by such partners. We collect personally
    identifiable information to allow our affiliates, our technical consultants, auditors and other third parties who work with us to make our sites and
    services available, enhance their functionality, or provide associated services to you such as delivering content, samples, products, and gifts and prizes.
    We may use your personally identifiable information to exchange, link or combine it with third party data groups to help better understand your needs and
    provide you with enhanced and more relevant service. Your personal information may be used to send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, support
    information and administrative messages.
</p>
<p>
    We send entrants a confirmation e-mail when they register for our sweepstakes or complete other transactions at our site. These confirmation e-mails are
    not promotional in nature and the user may not opt-out of receiving these transactional e-mails. If you are currently receiving commercial e-mail messages
    from Publishers Clearing House after previously providing permission and no longer wish to receive such offers you may unsubscribe at any time by clicking
    the unsubscribe link or the "EZ Unsubscribe" seal in any commercial e-mail from PCH. You may also contact PCH either through our "Ask Us" page in the Info
    Center section of PCH or by writing directly to Christopher L. Irving,, Consumer &amp; Privacy Affairs, PCH, 382 Channel Drive, Port Washington, New York,
    11050. We may send our PCH mobile application users push notifications, to inform them of new drawings and alert them of third party offers that may be of
    interest to them. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may do so by turning this feature off at the device level.
</p>
<p>
    We collect your location based information for the purpose of locating a place that you may be searching for in your area or alerting you to a special
    event in your area. We will only share this information with our mapping provider for the sole purpose of providing you the service. If you no longer wish
    to allow us to use this information you may turn it off at the device level.
</p>
<p>
    From time to time, we post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personal information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the
    customer's consent prior to posting these testimonials.
</p>
<p>

<p>
    When you order gift subscriptions on our site, we will ask you for your friend or family's contact information including name, mailing address and e-mail
    address. We will use this information only for the purpose that it was collected (i.e. to fulfill the gift subscription).
</p>
<p>
    When you utilize the share feature located within our mobile application we will ask for your friend's email address. We will use this information to send
    them a one-time email inviting them to visit and download the application.
</p>
<p>
    <strong id="gather">2. How and what information does PCH gather or track?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We collect personal data from our users mainly during the initial registration process for sweepstakes entry and order processing. Although some of the
    personal identifying information is necessary to deliver these services (e.g., an address is required to buy goods and services from PCH), in some cases
    the information is optional and in these instances users can determine what information they wish to submit. In addition some properties have an initial
    registration process and we may, from time to time, ask users to answer optional questions about products and services. We gather this data in order to
    better understand our users' interests and provide them with relevant offers and information.
</p>
<p>
    Through the use of "cookies" "pixel tags" "flash cookies" (described below) and online survey and registration forms, we may collect personal data on,
    among other things, the following information:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>Demographic: age, gender, income level</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Technical: IP address, domain name, e-mail address, site traffic</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Reference: name and address, telephone number, password</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The website that referred you to us.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The web pages you viewed on our site</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The advertisements you viewed and clicked on at our site.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Coupon activity including the types of coupons that you choose.</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    PCH collects certain personal information from our visitors to process and fulfill online entries for PCH drawings and to provide tokens and other gameplay
    rewards. For example, we need your full name, postal and email address to enter you in the PCH drawings, confirm your entry, contact you if you have won
    and notify you about any updates or changes to our site. If you create a profile you may have the ability to upload photos and create a tag line that can
    be shared with friends or the public. You get a friend when you click another user's avatar. This takes you to that user's page where you can click the
    "Add as a Friend" button. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email
    address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. PCH does not store this information and uses it for
    the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
</p>
<p>
    When you access PCH offered applications at social media sites like Facebook you allow us to access certain information from your profile at those sites.
    For example, when you access a game or application using the Facebook Platform, Facebook will usually provide the application your User ID, as well your
    friends' User IDs (or your friend list). The information you allow us to access is affected by the privacy settings you have established at the social
media site. You can control and find out more about these settings at Facebook at.    <a href="http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy">http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that
    run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to
    function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these
    Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong id="cookies">3. What are Cookies and other tracking technologies?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends,
    administer the digital property, tracking users' movements around the digital property, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a
    whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies, by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.
</p>
<p>
    "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer's hard drive or temporarily in your computer's
    memory. The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and users will find them on most major web sites, PCH may place and store Internet cookies on a
    user's hard drive. Cookies can save any of the types of information noted above. Cookies enable us to recognize you and personalize your viewing experience
    on the PCH site. For example, we use cookies to recognize user access privileges to PCH, track site usage and traffic patterns, add advertisements for
    goods or services that we think may interest you, and estimate our audience size. We also use cookies to store user names and information that are supplied
    at registration. Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you can decline the placement of a cookie on your hard
    drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of your web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie. Please note, however, that certain areas on the
    site will not function properly if your web browser does not accept cookies.
</p>
<p>
    "Pixel tracking", a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other sites, involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible
    to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of these advertisements and compiles
    aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites you may visit and is used to track an
    individual user's activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our offers with your
    interests. For example, if you visit our Web site from an advertisement on another site, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that their
    advertisement brought you to the PCH site. If you visit our website and we link you to another site we may also be able to determine that you were sent to
    and/or transacted with a third party web site. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research. Personal information about you is not
    collected by the third party advertising company, nor is any tracking information generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other
    purpose other than to report web site activity to us.
</p>
<p>
    We and third party partners use local shared objects, such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store your preferences such as volume
    control or high game score, or display content and/or display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity to personalize your visit. Flash cookies
    are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not
    remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click

    </a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP)
    addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this
    information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather
    demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information. Some of our business
    partners (e.g., tracking utility company) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.
</p>
<p>
    We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record
    information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the
    application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the
    mobile application. <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong id="disclosure">4. Does PCH disclose user information to third parties?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Except as otherwise noted in this policy, PCH only discloses user information in aggregate form to marketing partners. For example, we might tell a
    marketing partner how many users visited PCH over a period of time, but we will never tell them who it was that saw or clicked on their offer, unless that
    user has provided permission to do so.
</p>
<p>
    We share our users Android ID with application tracking companies so that we can track whether a user has downloaded one of our Customer's applications. We
    will share our unique ID for the user with our customer's so that we are able to provide users with their prizes.
</p>
<p>
    PCH believes that consumers should be able to control the use of their data. Users always have the option whether to engage in offers presented on PCH. In
    addition, the personal information our users provide to us may be combined with other personal information (such as demographic information and past
    purchase information) available from our records and other sources. We use a third party to verify your address, in order to process your order prior to
    shipping. This allows us and, with permission, to present our users with offers and information geared towards their interests. PCH is not and cannot be
    responsible for the activities or privacy policies of these third parties.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a merger, acquisition, or change of control of PCH, customer data would be considered a business asset and would be transferred. We will
    disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose personal
    information as required by law or to protect the safety and security of our users.
</p>
<p>
    You should also know that when you order a magazine subscription from PCH, we need to provide your name and address to the magazine publisher so they can
    start your service. Publishers may exchange or rent their subscriber names, typically to third party companies that match reader interests. If you do not
    wish to receive such offers, we suggest that you notify the publisher directly (the contact information is usually found in each magazine issue).
</p>
<p>
    We use other third parties vendors such as credit card processors and e-mail service providers to provide order fulfillment and e-mail delivery services on
    our site. When you register on our site, we will share your personal information as necessary for these third parties to provide these services. These
    third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose including their own marketing purposes and we maintain strict
    security measures and monitoring with such vendors to insure consumer information is safe. We may share your personally identifiable information with our
    affiliates, our technical consultants, auditors and other third parties who work with us to make our sites and services available, enhance their
    functionality, or provide associated services such as delivering you content, samples, products, and gifts and prizes. We may also use your personally
    identifiable information to exchange, link or combine it with third party data groups to help understand your needs and provide you with better and more
    relevant service.

    <strong>Targeted or Behavioral Advertising:</strong>
    Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior such as the pages they have
    visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which PCH advertisement should be displayed to a particular individual on
    websites other than PCH. For example, if you have shown a preference for cooking while visiting PCH, you may be served an advertisement from PCH for
    cooking related products when you visit a site other than PCH. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it
    does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used
    for targeted advertising either comes from PCH or through third party website publishers. We may use your personal data to serve you relevant ads based
    upon your interests through our own and select third party ad partners. In such cases, PCH will provide your personal data such as encrypted email address
    and mobile advertising identifier to such third party service providers so that we may serve you with ads that may be of interest to you. If you would like
to opt out of targeted advertising from PCH that occurs when visiting our third party advertising publishers, please    <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=pch01" target="_blank">click here</a>: Please note that this will opt you out of targeted ads from PCH and
    any other participating advertisers. If you opt out, you will continue to receive online advertising from Publishers Clearing House; however, these ads may
    not be as relevant to you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong id="optout"> 5. Can I opt-out of PCH's data collection and/or distribution?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Receiving email messages from PCH, our affiliates and partners is optional. As noted earlier, the collection, use, and distribution of personal data helps
    us create a more personalized, relevant, and intelligent web service for our users. While some basic data is necessary to provide certain services, such as
    entry into the sweepstakes and fulfillment of products and services ordered through PCH, there are some cases where the submission of information is
    optional.
</p>
<p>
    If you are already receiving PCH promotional emails and no longer wish to receive such communications, simply follow the "unsubscribe" instructions that
    appear in every PCH e-mail, or contact us through our "Ask Us" page found in our Info Center section or by writing directly to Christopher L. Irving,
    Consumer &amp; Privacy Affairs, PCH, 382 Channel Drive, Port Washington, New York, 11050. As soon as we receive your request our systems will process your
    removal at once and in all cases within the required time frame required by federal law.
</p>
<p>
    If you have provided personal information directly to our third party marketing partners and are receiving email communications directly from these third
    parties PCH cannot, in most instances, unsubscribe users from these third parties. If you wish to unsubscribe from one of our marketing partner's e-mail
    programs, please follow their unsubscribe procedures which will be found within their e-mails or in their privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong id="external">6. What about external web sites?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To the extent hyperlinks or banner advertisements incorporating hyperlinks are utilized on this Site to access third party sites, users should be aware
    that these third party web sites are not controlled by PCH and, therefore, are not subject to this privacy policy. We recommend that users check the
    privacy policies of these individual sites to see how their personal information will be utilized.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that our Web sites utilize framing techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the site when the user is actually on a third party
    Web site. For example, if you are on a page that has the look and feel of www.PCH , but the url listed in your browser is a different url than www.PCH,
    then know that the information is being collected by this third party and their privacy policy governs the collection and use of this information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong id="updating">7. Does PCH allow users access to their information for review and updating?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Upon request Publishers Clearing House will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal
    information. To request this information please contact us at

<p>
    <strong id="secure">8. What does PCH do to keep their site secure?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We have implemented a number of security features throughout the PCH properties that are intended to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to the
    user information we collect online. For example, database information is firewall protected. Also, only authorized PCH personnel have access to any stored
    personal information we collect from our users. Moreover, password and credit card information you submit to PCH is always encrypted during transmission.
    Users should be aware that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers.
</p>
<p>
    While we strive to create a secure and reliable site for our users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted over the Internet
    cannot be 100% guaranteed. Users should keep in mind that any information submitted through an Internet transaction is potentially accessible to the
    public, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without their consent. PCH is not responsible or liable for illegal interception of personal
    data via any Internet transaction. When we collect and transmit sensitive data such as your credit card number, we encrypt it using secure socket layer
    technology (SSL).
</p>
<p>
    We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request
    that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at <a href="mailto:privacychoices@">privacychoices@</a><u>pch.com</u> This e-mail
    address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript

    agreements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong id="outsideUS">9. Does PCH collect information from users outside of the United States?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The PCH site is not directed to visitors residing outside of the United States and such users are not eligible to submit online sweepstakes entries.
    However, as indicated in the Official Rules on the site, some sweepstakes promoted on the PCH Site are open to residents of the U.K. and Canada. Residents
    from these countries can participate in these sweepstakes by sending a write-in entry to the address provided in the Official Rules. We regret that as a
    result of system limitations at this time non-U.S. residents may not order products through PCH. If PCH becomes aware that a user who does not reside in
    the United States has registered with the PCH site, PCH will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from its files.
</p>
<p>
    <strong id="children">10. Does PCH collect personal information from children?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The PCH site is not targeted nor directed to children under the age of thirteen. PCH does not intend to collect personal information from individuals in
    this age group. If PCH receives actual notice that a child under the age of thirteen has provided personal information to PCH, PCH will use reasonable
    efforts to remove such information from its files.
