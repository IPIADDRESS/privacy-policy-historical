<h1>Our Commitment to Privacy</h1>


    <p>PCHelpSoft.com has created this policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the PC HelpSoft network of sites.    </p>
    <h3>Our Privacy Guarantee</h3><p>

We will never sell, rent or share any of your personal information with a third-party without your express prior permission. 

</p>

<h4>Information We Gather</h4>

<p>PC HelpSoft collects two kinds of information about users:
1) data that users volunteer by signing up to receive news and
product information, entering contests, completing surveys, or
buying directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect
when users interact with us.</p>


<h4>Personal information</h4>

<p>We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send
information you've requested and to fulfill orders. The specific
use of your personal information varies, depending on how you
contact us:</p>

<ul class="leaf">
<li>When you subscribe to one of our newletters to
receive industry news or services or subscribe to one of our mailing
lists, you must provide your email address.  This information is
solely used to provide these services to you.</li>


<li>When you purchase software or any other services from one of our websites,
we will ask for additional information such as name, address, 
and credit card information.  We will use this information as needed for your
purchase.  We will also store your name and email to contact
you regarding your purchases or as needed in the future.  All information
relating to your credit card (credit card number and expiration date) is
discarded after your purchase and is not stored on our servers.</li>

<li>When you enter a contest or survey, we may ask for your name,
address, and email address so we can administer the contest and
notify winners.</li>

<li>Any information you volunteer to us is used solely to provide
the specific services you requested.  We do not sell or rent any
information provided to us to third parties unless specifically noted
on the form you are filling out.  Please note, though, that our interactive
mailing lists may be archived by other third parties sites and that
if you contribute to this mailing lists (by posting an email message
directly to that mailing list), your information may be found in their
archives. </li>

</ul>


<br>
<h4>Log Files</h4>

<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site,
track user movement, and gather broad demographic information
for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally
identifiable information.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>As part of our approach to providing personalized services on our web site,
we employ the use of cookies to store and sometimes track information about you.
A cookie is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server to be
stored on your hard drive that allows easier access the next time the same

to this site. With your consent, cookies can store information from forms
you fill out to create a user profile so that you do not have to re-enter
the information each time you visit.</p>
<p>We may also employ third party cookies from our advertisers. These cookies do not store sensitive  information such as contact details.</p>

<p>If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you

responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other

<h4>Contests &amp; Surveys</h4>

<p>We may run contests or surveys on our site in which we ask
our users for contact information (like their email address).
We use the customer contact information from the entry form
to send the user information about our company and its
products, or to contact them when it becomes necessary
(notices like updates, new features, etc.). Users may opt-out
of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section
below).</p>


<h4>Security</h4>

<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss,
misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All

</p><h4>Advertisers</h4><p>

We use an outside advertising company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. 


</p><p>Some anonymous demographic data is shared with the advertising companies on an aggregate basis. 

</p><h4>Third Party Cookies</h4><p>

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique 'cookie' on your browser. 

</p>


<h4>Notification of Changes</h4>

changes on our site.  If we decide to use personally
identifiable information in a manner different from that
stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users
via email. Users will be able to opt out of any new use of
their personal information.</p>
