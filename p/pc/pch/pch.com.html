									<b>1. Why does pch.com collect personal information?</b> We need to collect certain personal information from our visitors primarily to process and fulfill online sweepstakes entries and online orders for the products and services we offer. For example, we need your full name and address to enter you in the sweepstakes, notify you if you've won a prize and to send you any magazine subscription or product you may purchase. We may also use the personal data we collect for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes, and to report aggregate information to our marketing partners and others. <br>
								</p>
								<p>To provide our users with a more personalized and relevant web service, we also collect and use personal data to identify users' specific interests and needs.  If given permission, we may notify our users of offers and information we feel may be of interest to them available from pch.com and our marketing partners. If given permission, we may also share information with select marketing partners who may directly contact our users regarding their own offers of interest.  If you do not want to receive such offers you may follow the simple unsubscribe procedure located at the permission notice box appearing on the pch.com registration and entry page. Our online registration and entry page contains a clearly identified checked box indicating that by submitting the form you wish to receive offers from pch.com and our marketing partners. Users may unsubscribe from such offers by clicking to remove the check in the permission notice box before submitting the registration and entry form. We may share our unsubscribe list with select marketing partners for the sole purpose of insuring that individuals on this list do not  receive electronic commercial mail messages containing Publishers Clearing House advertisements that may be sent by such partners.<br><br>

								If you are currently receiving commercial e-mail messages from Publishers Clearing House messages after previously providing permission and no longer wish to receive such offers you may always  follow the unsubscribe procedures which will be found within the commercial e-mails received from pch.com, our affiliates and marketing partners. You may also contact pch.com either through our "Ask Us" page in the Info Center section of pch.com or by writing directly to Christopher L. Irving, Senior Director of Consumer &amp; Privacy Affairs, pch.com, 382 Channel Drive, Port Washington, New York, 11050.<br>

									<b>2. How and what information does pch.com gather or track?</b> We collect personal data from our users mainly during the initial registration process for sweepstakes entry, game play, or order processing. Although some of the personal identifying information is necessary to deliver these services (e.g., an address is required to buy goods and services from pch.com), in some cases some of the information is optional. Users can determine to some extent what information they wish to submit. In addition to the initial registration process, we may, from time to time, ask users to answer optional questions about products and services. We gather this data in order to better understand our users' interests and provide them with relevant offers and information.<br>
								</p>
								<p>Through the use of "cookies" and “pixel tags” (both described below) and online survey and registration forms, we may collect personal data on, among other things, the following information:<br>

We use a third party advertising company to serve and host advertisements on other sites. &#x201C;Pixel tracking&#x201D;, a common process which may be used in connection with these advertisements on other sites, involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of these advertisements and compiles aggregate usage statistics. For example, if you visit our Web site from an advertisement on another site, the pixel tag will reference the cookie you received when you clicked on the advertisement. The pixel tag may also register this activity with the third party advertising company to allow us to count the number of times or when an advertisement is accessed. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research. Personally identifiable information about you is not collected by the third party advertising company, nor is any tracking information generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other purpose other than to report web site activity to us.

	<p>"Pixel tracking", a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other sites, involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of these advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites you may visit and is used to track an individual user's activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our offers with your interests.  For example, if you visit our Web site from an advertisement on another site, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that their advertisement brought you to the PCH site. If you visit our website and we link you to another site we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third party web site. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research. Personally identifiable information about you is not collected by the third party advertising company, nor is any tracking information generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other purpose other than to report web site activity to us.  <br>

									<b>4. Does pch.com disclose user information to third parties?</b> Except as otherwise noted in this policy, pch.com only discloses user information in aggregate form to marketing partners. For example, we might tell a marketing partner how many users visited pch.com over a period of time, but we will never tell them who it was that saw or clicked on their offer, unless that user has given us permission to do so. <br>
								</p>
								<p>pch.com believes that consumers should be able to control the use of their data. We will not share personally identifiable information with marketing partners if you follow the simple unsubscribe procedure of removing the check mark located at the permission notice box appearing on the pch.com registration and entry page. If an opt out is not submitted,  we will notify users of exciting offers of interest from pch.com and our marketing partners. We may also share your name, land address and e-mail address with marketing partners so that they can send you offers directly for products and services that may be of interest to you. The personal information our users provide to us may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. This allows us and our marketing partners , with permission, to present our users with offers and information geared towards their interests. We require each permission based e-mail our partners send to include a description of a simple opt-out process that will enable you to stop receiving promotional e-mail from them in the future.  We will only deal with marketing partners who offer products or services that we believe may be of interest to our users.  Nevertheless, pch.com is not and cannot be responsible for the activities or privacy policies of these third parties. We may share our unsubscribe list with select marketing partners for the sole purpose of insuring that individuals on this list do not  receive electronic commercial mail messages containing Publishers Clearing House advertisements that may be sent by such partners.<br>
								</p>
								<p>We do not rent, license, or sell personal data to third parties unless permission is granted through user submission of the checked permission notice box appearing at the registration and entry page of pch.com.  In the event of a merger, acquisition, or change of control of pch.com, customer data would be considered a business asset and would be transferred. We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose personal information as required by law or to protect the safety and security of our users.  <br>
								</p>
								<p>You should also know that when you order a magazine subscription from pch.com, we need to provide your name and address to the magazine publisher so they can start your service. Publishers may exchange or rent their subscriber names, typically to third party companies that match reader interests. If you do not wish to receive such offers, we suggest that you notify the publisher directly (the contact information is usually found in each magazine issue).<br>

									<b>5. Can I opt-out of pch.com's data collection and/or distribution? <br>
									</b></p>

As noted earlier, the collection, use, and distribution of personal data helps us create a more personalized, relevant, and intelligent web service for our users.
