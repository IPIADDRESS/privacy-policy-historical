									<b>1. Why does pch.com collect personal information?</b> We need to collect certain personal information from our visitors primarily  to process and fulfill online sweepstakes entries and online orders for the  products and services we offer. For example, we need your full name, &nbsp;&nbsp;e-mail address and date of birth to verify  eligibility and enter you in the sweepstakes, notify you if you've won a prize  and to send you any magazine subscription or product you may purchase. We may  also use the personal data we collect for systems administration and  troubleshooting purposes, and to report aggregate information to our marketing  partners and others. <br><br>
To provide our users with a more personalized and relevant web service, we  also collect and use personal data to identify users' specific interests and  needs. If given permission, we may notify our users of offers and information  we feel may be of interest to them available from pch.com and our marketing  partners. If given permission, we may also share information with select  marketing partners who may directly contact our users regarding their own  offers of interest. If you do not want to receive such offers you may follow  the simple unsubscribe procedure located at the permission notice box appearing  on the pch.com registration and entry page. Our online registration and entry  page contains a clearly identified checked box indicating that by submitting  the form you wish to receive offers from pch.com and our marketing partners.  Users may unsubscribe from such offers by clicking to remove the check in the  permission notice box before submitting the registration and entry form. We may  share our unsubscribe list with select marketing partners for the sole purpose  of insuring that individuals on this list do not receive electronic commercial  mail messages containing Publishers Clearing House advertisements that may be  sent by such partners.<br>
<br>
We send entrants a confirmation e-mail when they register for our sweepstakes.  These confirmation e-mails are not promotional in nature and the user may not  opt-out of receiving these transactional e-mails.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are currently receiving commercial  e-mail messages from Publishers Clearing House messages after previously  providing permission and no longer wish to receive such offers you may always  follow the unsubscribe procedures which will be found within the commercial  e-mails received from pch.com, our affiliates and marketing partners. You may  also contact pch.com either through our "Ask Us" page in the Info Center  section of pch.com or by writing directly to Christopher L. Irving, Senior  Director of Consumer &amp; Privacy Affairs, pch.com, 382 Channel Drive, Port Washington,   New York, 11050.<br>
<br>
From time to time, we post customer testimonials  on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as  the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting these  testimonials. &nbsp;<br><br>
If you use our blog on this web site or participate in chat rooms on this  site , you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you  submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of this forum, and  could be used to send you unsolicited messages.&nbsp;  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you  choose to submit in this forum.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>When you order gift subscriptions on our site, we will ask you for your  friend or family’s contact information including name, mailing address and  e-mail address. We will use this information only for the purpose that it was  collected (i.e. to fulfill the gift subscription). </p><p><br>

                                  <b>2. How and what information does pch.com gather or track?</b> We collect personal data from our users mainly during the initial  registration process for sweepstakes entry and &nbsp;order processing. Although some of the  personal identifying information is necessary to deliver these services (e.g.,  an address is required to buy goods and services from pch.com), in some cases  some of the information is optional. Users can determine to some extent what  information they wish to submit.

									<b>3. What are Cookies?</b> "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your  web browser software on your computer's hard drive or temporarily in your  computer's memory. The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and users  will find them on most major web sites, &nbsp;pch.com may place and store Internet cookies  on a user's hard drive. Cookies can save any of the types of information noted  above. Cookies enable us to recognize you and personalize your viewing  experience on the pch.com site. For example, we use cookies to recognize user  access privileges to pch.com, track site usage and traffic patterns, add  advertisements for goods or services that we think may interest you, and  estimate our audience size. We also use cookies to store user names and  information that are supplied at registration. Although most web browsers are  initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you can decline the  placement of a cookie on your hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of  your web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie. Please note,  however, that certain areas on the site will not function properly if your web  browser does not accept cookies.<br><br>
"Pixel tracking", a common process which may be used in connection  with advertisements on other sites, involves the use of pixel tags that are not  visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding.  Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of these advertisements and compiles  aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an  invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites you may visit and is used to  track an individual user's activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify  activity and interests that may allow us to better match our offers with your  interests. For example, if you visit our Web site from an advertisement on  another site, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that their  advertisement brought you to the PCH site. If you visit our website and we link  you to another site we may also be able to determine that you were sent to  and/or transacted with a third party web site. This data is collected for use  in our marketing and research. Personally identifiable information about you is  not collected by the third party advertising company, nor is any tracking  information generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any  other purpose other than to report web site activity to us. <br><br>
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically  and store it in log files.&nbsp; This  information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet  service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time  stamp, and clickstream data.&nbsp; We use this  information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to  administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather  demographic information about our user base as a whole.&nbsp; We do not  link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.<br>Some of our business partners (e.g., tracking utility company) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies.

<br>
<a name="4"></a><br><b>4. Does pch.com disclose user information to third parties? </b>Except as otherwise noted in this policy, pch.com only discloses user  information in aggregate form to marketing partners. For example, we might tell  a marketing partner how many users visited pch.com over a period of time, but  we will never tell them who it was that saw or clicked on their offer, unless that  user has given us permission to do so. <br><br>
pch.com believes that consumers should be able to control the use of their  data. We will not share personally identifiable information with marketing  partners if you follow the simple unsubscribe procedure of removing the check  mark located at the permission notice box appearing on the pch.com registration  and entry page. If an opt-out is not submitted, we will notify users of  exciting offers of interest from pch.com and our marketing partners. We may  also share your name, land address and e-mail address with marketing partners  so that they can send you offers directly for products and services that may be  of interest to you. The personal information our users provide to us may be  combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic  information and past purchase information) available from our records and other  sources. &nbsp;We use a third party to verify  your address, in order to process your order prior to shipping. This allows us and our marketing partners ,  with permission, to present our users with offers and information geared  towards their interests. We require each permission based e-mail our partners  send to include a description of a simple opt-out process that will enable you  to stop receiving promotional e-mail from them in the future. We will only deal  with marketing partners who offer products or services that we believe may be  of interest to our users. Nevertheless, pch.com is not and cannot be  responsible for the activities or privacy policies of these third parties. We  may share our unsubscribe list with select marketing partners for the sole  purpose of insuring that individuals on this list do not receive electronic  commercial mail messages containing Publishers Clearing House advertisements  that may be sent by such partners.<br><br>
We do not rent, license, or sell personal data to third parties unless  permission is granted through user submission of the checked permission notice  box appearing at the registration and entry page of pch.com. In the event of a  merger, acquisition, or change of control of pch.com, customer data would be  considered a business asset and would be transferred. We will disclose  information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response  to a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose personal information as  required by law or to protect the safety and security of our users. <br><br>
You should also know that when you order a magazine subscription from  pch.com, we need to provide your name and address to the magazine publisher so  they can start your service. Publishers may exchange or rent their subscriber  names, typically to third party companies that match reader interests. If you  do not wish to receive such offers, we suggest that you notify the publisher  directly (the contact information is usually found in each magazine issue).<br><br>
We use other third parties such as credit card processors and  e-mail service providers to provide order fulfillment and e-mail delivery  services on our site.&nbsp; When you register  on our site, we will share your personally identifiable information as  necessary for these third parties to provide these services.&nbsp; <p></p>
                              <p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally  identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing  purposes.</p>
<p>
When you register with pch.com we may share your name and information with third parties who may contact you by mail with relevant offers. If you wish to opt out of such exchanges you may <a href="http://prism.pch.com/PrismOptout/GenericOptout.aspx">click here.</a><br><br><br>
<b><u>Targeted or Behavioral Advertising:</u> </b> Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses information collected on an individual’s web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which pch.com advertisement should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than pch.com. For example, if you have shown a preference for cooking while visiting pch.com, you may be served an advertisement from pch.com for cooking related products when you visit a site other than pch.com. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from pch.com or through third party website publishers.<u> If you would like to opt out of targeted advertising from pch.com that occurs when visiting our third party advertising publishers,</u> please <a href="http://prism.pch.com/PrismOptout/PartnerPreferences.aspx">click here</a>: Please note that this will opt you out of targeted ads from pch.com and any other participating advertisers. If you opt out, you will continue to receive online advertising from  Publishers Clearing House; however, these ads may not be as relevant to you.

What about external web sites?  </b>To the extent hyperlinks or banner advertisements incorporating hyperlinks  are utilized on this Site to access third party sites, users should be aware  that these third party web sites are not controlled by pch.com and, therefore,  are not subject to this privacy policy. We recommend that users check the privacy  policies of these individual sites to see how their personal information will  be utilized.<p></p>
Please note that our Web sites utilize framing  techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the site when the user  is actually on a third party Web site.&nbsp;  For example, if you are on a page that has the look and feel of  www.pch.com , but the url listed in your browser is a different url than <a href="http://www.pch.com/">www.pch.com</a>,  then know that the information is being collected by this third party and their  privacy policy governs the collection and use of this information.&nbsp;
