        <p align="left" class="style5">Armadillo Inc may use cookies to   			personalize or enhance your user experience.&nbsp; A cookie is a   			small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page   			server.&nbsp; <strong> Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your   			computer.</strong>&nbsp; Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can   			only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to   			you.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left" class="style5">One of the primary purposes of cookies is to   			provide a convenience feature to save you time.&nbsp; For example,   			if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie   			helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent   			visits.&nbsp; Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering   			relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving   			your preferences and login information as well as providing   			personalized functionality..&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left" class="style5">Armadillo Inc reserves the right to   			share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does   			not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless   			there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging   			into Armadillo Inc.com a site that relies on third-party   			cookies).&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left" class="style5">You have the ability to accept or decline   			cookies.&nbsp; Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but   			you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.
