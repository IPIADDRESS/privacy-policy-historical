Cookies are used for such purposes as facilitating and personalizing your shopping and ordering experience, keeping track of your shopping basket during your visit, helping diagnose problems with our server, and administering our Site. We may use the information collected through cookies for marketing purposes to inform you of special offers, better understand your needs or answer your questions.

A Web beacon is an electronic image, often called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF that is ordinarily not visible to the site visitor.&nbsp; Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor’s computer, such as a visitor’s cookie number, time and date of a page or image view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed.&nbsp; When used in an e-mail, they can tell us whether an e-mail has been opened.&nbsp;<br><br></p></div><div class="content_header fbold fsize16 fgrey">How We Protect Your Personal Information</div><div align="justify" class="content_body fsize12 fgrey"><p>To help protect the security of your PII, PC Mall seeks to use security technology and procedures, which are reviewed periodically.&nbsp; We use encryption technology and Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”) in all areas where your personal and account information is required.&nbsp; This means that the PII you submit to us via our Site is encrypted by your computer, and then decrypted again on our side, discouraging others from accessing your private information during transmission.&nbsp; If your browser does not support SSL or if you are unable to establish a secure connection due to a company firewall, please call us at (800) 555-MALL to place your order by phone.<br> &nbsp; <br> In addition, your personal, account information, and transaction history are kept behind our firewall.&nbsp; <br> <br> Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; As a result, although we strive to protect PII about you, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with the Site or that is stored by us.<br><br></p></div><div class="content_header fbold fsize16 fgrey">Correcting/Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences</div><div align="justify" class="content_body fsize12 fgrey"><p>If you would like to opt-out of having your PII shared with unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes, or to make changes to your PII or to your preferences regarding the marketing information that you receive from PC Mall or our affiliates, please <a href="https://www.pcmall.com/o/Update-References/msc-96" class="blue_link_noline">click here </a>.&nbsp; We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request.&nbsp; Please note that we may need to contact you in order to be sure that we are updating the appropriate information.&nbsp; When requesting that PII be updated or that your preferences be changed, please keep in mind that until the change is implemented, you may still receive email and/or physical mailings from us.&nbsp; Furthermore, there will be residual information that will remain within PC Mall databases, access logs and other records, which may contain such PII.&nbsp; The residual information will not be used for marketing purposes; however, PC Mall reserves the right, from time to time, to re-contact former customers or visitors to the Site.&nbsp; Please note that we are not responsible for retracting your PII from third parties with whom we have shared your information pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Policy as in effect from time to time.&nbsp;<br><br></p></div><div class="content_header fbold fsize16 fgrey">Other Information We Collect</div><div class="content_body fsize12 fgrey" style="justify"><p>Information About Your Computer and Your Site Activities: When a visitor comes to our Site we collect and aggregate information about the visitor’s computer (such as its IP address, operating system and browser software), and click-stream information (such as the address (or “URL”) of the Web site that the visitor came from before visiting our Site, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which hyperlinks were clicked) for the purpose of assessing our Site traffic and the effectiveness of our Site content, as well as to help diagnose problems with our servers.&nbsp;
