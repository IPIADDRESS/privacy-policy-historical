      <h4>Privacy Information for <a href="http://www.pcrecruiter.net/">www.pcrecruiter.net</a> </h4>
      <p>This Safe Harbor Privacy Statement (the Statement) sets  forth the privacy principles followed by Main Sequence in connection with the  transfer and protection of "personal information" received from the  European Union (EU). </p>
      <p>The Statement is directed toward two classes of user:  Account Owners and Public Users. </p>
      <p>Main Sequence has certified that our privacy practices  comply with the Safe Harbor standards.  Please be aware that Main Sequence is not responsible for the privacy  and security practices of our customers. </p>
      <p><strong>ALL INFORMATION ENTERED INTO PCRECRUITER.NET IS THE SOLE  PROPERTY OF THE MAIN SEQUENCE CUSTOMER ACCOUNT OWNER. </strong></p>
      <p><strong> Main Sequence does not control or monitor the collection, use or disclosure of  information collected from Public Users by Account Owners. Main Sequence expressly disclaims any and all  liability related to any collection, disclosure or use of such information relating  to Public Users. In addition, we encourage all site visitors to seek out and  read the privacy policies of account owners and all sites visited on the  Internet. Main Sequence is in the  solutions hosting business and may host databases for account owners at website  addresses other than <a href="http://www.pcrecruiter.net/">www.pcrecruiter.net</a>. </strong></p>
      <p>The "Safe Harbor" program was jointly established  in June 2000 by the United States Department of Commerce and the European  Commission, as a method for transferring personal information from the European  Union (EU), to companies in the United States. The program is a voluntary  self-certification process for companies operating in the United States.  Companies that certify represent that they are upholding privacy standards for  personal information received from the EU that have been jointly accepted by  the EU Commission and the US Department of Commerce. </p>
      <p>These standards exceed current US privacy standards. </p>
      <p>"Personal Information" means information that can  directly or indirectly lead to the identification of a person, such as an  individual's name, address, e-mail, telephone number, license number, medical  identification number, photograph, or other identifying characteristic. The  identification can occur by reference to one or more factors specific to the  individual's identity. Personal information does not include information that  has been encoded or otherwise stripped of its identifiers, or information that  is publicly available, unless combined with other non-public personal  information.</p>
      <p> The following privacy principles apply to the transfer,  collection, use or disclosure of personal information of Public Users and/or  Account Owners from the EU by Main Sequence. <br>
        .<br>
        <strong>Notice:</strong> Main Sequence informs Account Owners in the  EU about the purposes for which it collects and uses their personal  information, how to contact Main Sequence, the types of third parties with  which Main Sequence shares their personal information, and the choice and means  Main Sequence offers for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal  information.</p>
      <p>Consistent with the Safe Harbor requirements, Main Sequence  may not be in a position to furnish notice in certain situations. Specifically,  notice is not required where the processing of EU personal information is  necessary to respond to a government inquiry; is required by applicable laws,  court orders or government regulations; or is necessary to protect Main  Sequence's legal interests and providing notice would interfere with those interests. Main Sequence provides copyright notices  within its solutions to that Public Users may identify Main Sequence as the  solution provider as a step toward contact with Account Owners. Main Sequence will make reasonable efforts  to assure that Public Users can contact Account Owners when privacy concerns  are presented. </p>
      <p> <strong>Choice:</strong> Main Sequence will not process personal information  about EU Account Owners for purposes other than those for which the information  was originally obtained or subsequently authorized by the Account Owner unless the individual affirmatively and  explicitly consents ("opt-in") to the processing, or unless an  exception applies. </p>
      <p>Main Sequence also Account Owners with the opportunity to  withdraw consent at any time ("opt-out"), in which case their  personal information will not be further processed. The use of any opt-out provision by itself  will not alter or abrogate any contractual obligations between the parties. </p>
      <p>Main Sequence collects personal information that is adequate,  relevant and not excessive for the purposes for which it is to be processed.</p>
      <p><strong>Transfers To Third Parties:</strong> Main Sequence will only transfer  personal information about Account Owners or Public Users to third-parties  where the third-party (a) has provided satisfactory assurances to Main Sequence  that it will protect the information consistently with this Statement; or (b)  is located in the EU or a country considered "adequate" for privacy  by the EU Commission, and therefore is required to comply with the EU data  protection laws or substantially equivalent privacy laws; or (c) the  third-party has also certified to the Safe Harbor, and is accordingly  independently responsible for complying with the Safe Harbor requirements,  excepting if a change occurs in Main Sequence's corporate structure, including  without limitation, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of  substantial assets, Main Sequence may, in its sole and absolute discretion,  transfer, sell or assign information which it has collected and owns, including  without limitation aggregated information and personally identifiable  information of Account Owners, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third  parties.</p>
      <p>Where Main Sequence has knowledge that a third-party,  including successor organizations, to whom it has provided EU personal  information is processing that information in a manner contrary to this  Statement or the Safe Harbor requirements, Main Sequence will take reasonable  steps to prevent or stop the processing. </p>
      <p>Upon written request to Main Sequence Main Sequence will  provide EU Account Owners with an inventory of personal information held. Main Sequence will also take reasonable  steps to allow Account Owners to review their information for the purposes of  correcting their information. There are certain limitations to the Access and  Correction rights, as set forth in the US Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor  website.</p>
      <p><strong>Security: </strong>Main Sequence takes reasonable precautions to  protect EU personal information in its possession from loss, misuse,  unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>
      <p><strong>Enforcement:</strong> Main Sequence has established internal  mechanisms to verify its ongoing adherence to this Statement. Account Owners are parties to additional  agreements with Main Sequence, which govern ownership and use of Information,  dispute resolution, and other terms and conditions relating to the use of Main  Sequence solutions. </p>
      <p>Main Sequence has also agreed to participate in the dispute  resolution program provided by the European Data Protection Authorities.</p>
      <p>Adherence to these Privacy Principles may be limited to the  extent required to meet a legal, governmental, national security or public  interest obligation.</p>
