	<p align="center">Last Updated on October 1, 2007</p>

        <p>
	At Future US, Inc., a magazine, disc media and website publisher, we are interested in protecting your privacy.
	But sometimes we do need information to understand how to make our properties more interesting, more specialized
	and more successful, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please
	read the complete privacy statement.
        </p>

	<p><strong>Non US Visitors:</strong></p>

        <p>
	Our privacy policy is intended to meet the laws and requirements of the United States. If you are visiting from
	outside the United States any information you provide will be treated in accordance with the laws of the United
	States or, if the law in jurisdiction does not permit you to access our website, then you must not maintain
	access to it.
        </p>

	<p><strong>Collecting your Personal Information:</strong></p>

        <p>
	We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (that is, your first and last name; your
	home or business address; your e-mail address; your telephone number; your gender) or allows us to contact you.
	Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register before entering a contest, ordering
	e-mail newsletters, or if you subscribe to one of our magazines or properties, or elect to participate in a forum
	and/or a survey. Personal information collected by any of our websites often is limited to e-mail address, language,
	country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service to you.
        </p>

        <p>
	For example: If you choose to subscribe to a magazine or e-mail newsletter, we may request personal information
	such as: name, address, telephone number, and shipping information.
        </p>

	<p><strong>Use of your Personal Information:</strong></p>

	<p>We may use your personal information for the following primary purposes:</p>

        <p>
        </p><ul>
	    <li>
	    	To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    	To alert you to special offers, updated information and other services.
            </li>
	    <li>
		To help us determine if any modifications need to be made to our publications or with respect to
		oursubscriptions.
            </li>
            <li>
		To contact you regarding participation in a reader survey.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <p>
	We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and
	delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing
	event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they
	are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
	We also will occasionally share this information with third parties so that you may be informed of matters, services
	or products of interest to readers of our magazines.
        </p>

        <p>
	We will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith
	belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served
	on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety
	of users of any of our websites, or the public; and (d) comply with negotiated agreements in the event of a merger
	or sale of any of our products.
        </p>

	<p><strong>Control of your Personal Information:</strong></p>

        <p>
	When you register on one of our websites, or otherwise give us personal information, we will not share that information
	with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used
	for the purposes stated above.
        </p>

        <p>
	We will occasionally allow other companies to offer our customers information about their products and services. If
	you do not wish to receive any such mailings, you may send an e-mail to
	<a href="mailto:webmaster@futureus.com">webmaster@futureus.com</a>.
        </p>


	<p><strong>Security of your Personal Information:</strong></p>

        <p>
	Future US, Inc., will use its best efforts to protect the security of your personal information and honor your
	choices for its intended use.
        </p>

        <p>
	Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions
	explained above.
        </p>

	<p><strong>Email Correspondence:</strong></p>

        <p>
	We may respond to email sent directly to us or through a online submission form. This information and emails would
	only be shared with a third party in connection with a court order, sale of the website(s) to a third party or to
	defend a legal claim. These emails would only rarely be used for one time correspondence with that user. These
	e-mails are kept internally for our own day to day business purposes.
        </p>

	<p><strong>Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy<br>
		(Users under the age of 13):</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
	In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy
	Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may
	collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with our policy
	and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:
        </p>
        <p>

        </p><p>
            </p><ul>
                <li>
			Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable online or offline contact 
			information from users under 13 years of age;
                </li>
                <li>
			Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age 
			with third parties;
                </li>
                <li>
			Give children the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable
			contact information;
                </li>
                <li>
			Entice children with the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity to divulge 
			more information than is needed to participate in the activity.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p></p>

	<p><strong>Parental Rights:</strong></p>

        <p>
	Except upon our receipt from a parent or guardian, we DO NOT collect information from children under 13. We are required
	by COPPA to post parental rights concerning removal of this information.
        </p>

        <p>
	A parent or guardian may confirm, correct or have deleted the child's personal information; discontinue further use
	of the child's information and/or communication with the child; and/or revoke his or her earlier consent to collect
	and use the child's information. To do so, please contact us at
	<a href="mailto:webmaster@futureus.com">webmaster@futureus.com</a>
	and we will review or update your child's information as appropriate. Please be sure to include in your email message
	the information you want changed or deleted.
        </p>

	<p><strong>Message Receipt &amp; COPPA:</strong></p>

        <p>
	Our receipt of messages is set up to only accept registrations from ages 13 and up. Any users under 13 who try to
	register are screened via a online age check that uses cookies. Users under 13 who wish to register must submit a
	signed parental consent form to do so. The parent will then decide what information to release on the parental
	form which may include address, phone number &amp; email address. We maintain this information on file for COPPA
	compliance and do not share this information with third parties.
        </p>

        <p>
	With proper identification parents can remove their under 13 child from participation in our message board
	(See Parental Rights above).
        </p>

	<p><strong>Use of Cookies:</strong></p>

        <p>
	To ensure we are publishing content customers need and want, we may elect to collect aggregated site-visitation
	statistics using cookies. We do not track individual's use of the site.
        </p>

        <p>
	We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit certain of our websites. These companies
	may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to
	this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services
	that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices

        <p>
	Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you
	when cookies are being sent. However, some areas will not function properly if you do so. There are many sources
	for additional information about Internet cookies, and we encourage anyone concerned about the use of cookies to
	do more research on the topic so you can make an informed decision about accepting them from any site. As technology
	advances and cookies provide more functionality, we expect to utilize them in different ways.
