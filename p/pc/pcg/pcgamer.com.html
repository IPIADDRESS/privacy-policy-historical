<p align="center">Statement of Privacy</p>

<p align="center">Last Updated on March
10, 2005</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Future Network USA, Inc., a magazine publisher, we are interested
in protecting your privacy. But sometimes we do need information to understand
how to make our magazines more interesting, more specialized and more
successful, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in
those situations. Please read the complete privacy statement. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Collecting your Personal Information</strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will ask you when we need information that personally
identifies you (that is, your first and last name; your home or business
address; your e-mail address; your telephone number; your gender) or allows us
to contact you.  Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to
register before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, or if you
subscribe to one of our magazines or elect to participate in a forum and/or a
survey.  Personal information collected by any of our websites often is limited
to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other
information when needed to provide a service to you. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example: If you choose to subscribe to a magazine, we
will request personal information such as: name, address, telephone number, and
shipping information. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Use of your Personal Information</strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We use your personal information for the following primary
purposes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>To help us create and deliver content most relevant to
you.</li>
<li>To alert you to special offers, updated information and
other services. </li>
<li>To help us determine if any modifications need to be made
to our publications or with respect to our subscriptions.</li>


<li>To contact you regarding participation in a reader survey.</li>


<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited
services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases,
answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail
and processing event registration.  We will only provide those companies the
information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from
using that information for any other purpose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Certain services may be co-branded
and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use
such services, both Future Network USA and the other company may receive
information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may also on occasion share this information with third
parties so that you may be informed of matters, services or products of
interest to readers of our magazines.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will sometimes allow other companies to offer our
customers information about their products and services. If you do not wish to
receive any such mailings, you may send an e-mail to <b><a href="mailto:webmaster@futurenetworkusa.com"><span>webmaster@futurenetworkusa</span></a></b><span>.com.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will disclose your personal information, without notice,
only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action
is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal
process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) act in
urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of any of our
websites, or the public; and (d) comply with negotiated agreements in the event
of a merger or sale of any of our products. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Control of your Personal Information</strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you register on one of our website, or otherwise give
us personal information, we will not share that information with third parties
without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed.
It will only be used for the purposes stated above. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will occasionally allow other companies to offer our
customers information about their products and services.  If you do not wish to
receive any such mailings, you may send an e-mail to
webmaster@www.futurenetworkusa.com.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Security of your Personal Information</strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Future Network USA, Inc., will use its best efforts to
protect the security of your personal information and honor your choices for
its intended use. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your personal information is never shared outside the
company without your permission, except under conditions explained above. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Asset Transfer</u></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy
assets or portions of our business. In such transactions, customer and user
information is generally one of the transferred business assets. In the event
that this Web site or substantially all of its assets (or substantially all of
its assets relating to a particular periodical or business area) are acquired,
Future Network USA, Inc. may transfer all customer and user information as part
of the transferred assets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

we may elect to collect aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies. We
do not track individuals' use of the site. </p>

<strong>Changes to this Statement</strong>

<p>We will occasionally update this privacy statement. When we
do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the
privacy statement. For material changes to this Statement, we will notify you
by placing prominent notice on the Web site. </p>
