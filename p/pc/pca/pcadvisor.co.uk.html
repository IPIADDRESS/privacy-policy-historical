Since its launch at the end of 2000 the PC Advisor forums have grown consistently. We now have over 70,000 registered members, and each week hundreds of computer problems are solved. Those of a technical nature are dealt with in the Helproom; consumer issues are resolved in ConsumerWatch. For those who enjoy discussing games, and gaming problems there's the Gamesroom.<p>

Any organised gathering must have rules and conventions if it is to operate efficiently, and the PC Advisor forums are no exception. On the whole we function with a minimum of red tape, and we want our visitors to feel welcome and able to express themselves in their own way. We are a family-friendly forum however, and there are inevitably some do's and don'ts that must be observed if we are to get along together. Regular forum users will be familiar with much of what follows. Newcomers, who may be unfamiliar with web-forum procedures, should find it useful. It's your forum, we hope you'll enjoy your time here.</p><p>


<b>Terminology</b><br><br>

Plain English is the order of the day, but there are some words that you will see being used regularly.</p><p>

</p><ul><li><b>Thread</b> - the word used to describe a forum topic. A thread may be started by any forum member to explain a problem and ask for help - just click on the words 'Start new subject for discussion' that you'll see in blue at the top of the Helproom, ConsumerWatch, or Gamesroom sections.
</li><li><b>Post</b> - a message that is 'posted' to a thread by anyone who wishes to contribute. When you click on a thread title it will open to reveal all the messages that have been posted by other forum members. To add your own comments, use the box that you'll see at the end of each thread.
</li><li><b>Green tick</b> - this is used to indicate that a subject has been satisfactorily resolved, and can only be placed on a thread by the person who starts it. Once there the tick can't be removed, but others may still post comments to it. More on green ticks later.
</li><li><b>Refresh</b> - if your problem isn't receiving any attention it will gradually slip down page 1 and onto page 2 or 3 - it depends on the number of threads being posted at any one time. You can bring your subject back to the top of the list by posting the word 'refresh' in it. Please don't so this more than once - it can irritate other users, and if you get no response the second time around it's possible that nobody in the forum can help on this occasion. It's rare for that to be the case however.
</li><li><b>Moderator</b> - someone who watches the forum for inappropriate thread content. We monitor forum activity, and the forum editor will sometimes remove threads or posts if he believes them to be inappropriate in nature. If you are unhappy about a particular post or thread, or if you want to contact us privately you can do so at any time by clicking on the words 'Contact moderator' which you will see in the yellow bar at the bottom of each thread. Type your message and click the 'Send message' button; we'll contact you as soon as possible. Please don't use this facility to ask for help with computing problems - we can't provide this on a one-to-one basis by email.</li></ul><p>

<b>Best practice</b><br><br>

We have evolved a system of day to day conduct which we believe helps the forum to function smoothly, and we look to our members to abide by the system whenever possible. We are a community, and we expect our members to respect our code of conduct.</p><p>

</p><ul><li><b>Personal email addresses</b> - please do not include your email address when posting a thread or a message in a thread.  Personal privacy is something that once compromised is difficult to regain, and posting an address in a web forum is akin to advertising it on TV - it can be read (and used) by thousands of strangers.
</li><li><b>Forum email links</b> - when you post a message in a thread a small envelope icon will appear alongside your username. This enables anyone to send you a personal message by email, but it does NOT disclose your email address to them. This can only happen if you reply to their message - so don't do that if you want to remain anonymous. Please don't use the email contact facility indiscriminately - by and large it's best to do it only when invited to do so by another forum user.
</li><li><b>Offensive comment</b> - forum discussions can sometimes become heated. They often take place more or less in real time, and it can be tempting to respond offensively in the heat of the moment. Personal abuse directed at another forum member is totally unacceptable, and such posts will be removed without warning. Repeated incidents may result in a forum member's registration being invalidated permanently.
</li><li><b>Thread titles</b> - Please try to give your thread a meaningful title - one which will indicate its subject matter to other forum users. A thread entitled "Aaaaaargghhhh!!!!!!!!!!! What's wrong with my computer?" will irritate other users, and will be less likely to attract the right help. Good thread titles indicate the problem's nature "My modem doesn't dial" tells everyone what to expect.
</li><li><b>Inform us</b> - when posting your thread please try to provide as much information as you can. Give details of your operating system, which software or hardware appears to be causing the trouble and the full text of any error message if possible.
</li><li><b>Green tick protocol</b> - when your problem is solved we'll expect you to give the thread a green tick - you'll find the button at the end of your thread. Once you've ticked the thread it will remain 'open' to further posts, but other forum users can see that you're OK - and will not open the thread unnecessarily. Green ticks also help people who are searching the archive. We have an option to search only for problems that are resolved. Please try to remember to tick your thread.
</li><li><b>Items for sale</b> - we don't permit the posting of threads that advertise items for sale. The associated legal and administrative problems mean that this policy will be strictly enforced.
</li><li><b>Personal contact</b> - we do not advise you to arrange personal meetings with other forum users. You would be meeting a total stranger, you cannot verify another member's age or sex, and such arrangements are inherently fraught with risk.
</li><li><b>Search the archive</b> - it's on the cards that your problem has cropped up before, so we maintain a forum archive of previously posted threads. You can search the archive by using the facility at the top of each forum section, and we hope that you'll do so before posting - it could save you a lot of time.
</li><li><b>Read the reviews</b> - many threads ask for advice about new hardware and software. We have an excellent review section in the forum, and we suggest that you refer to it before you post your thread.</li></ul><p>

<b>Forbidden territory</b><br><br>

Some behaviour is unacceptable in the forum, and we will insist on the following rules being observed at all times.</p><p>

</p><ul><li><b>Bad language</b> - it isn't necessary to use bad language to make a point. Although modern usage has seen many previously unacceptable terms become a part of everyday conversation, there are certain words which are universally acknowledged as being inappropriate in normal conversation. We will exercise our right to remove any posts that (in our opinion) contain such language, and the forum editor's decision will be final.
</li><li><b>'Adult' content</b> - references or links of an adult nature will not be tolerated - posts or threads that contain links to 'adult' sites, text, or images will be deleted without warning. 
</li><li><b>Chat threads</b> - There are thousands of chat-related sites on the internet, but ours is not one of them. We exist to provide help and advice to people who have computer-related problems, and we will not permit threads to wander off-topic into general chat. 
</li><li><b>Racist or sexist comment</b> - we will not tolerate racist or sexist comments in any form.
</li><li><b>Libellous or defamatory comment</b> - please do not exhort others to boycott a company that provided you with bad service or products. Do not make statements that you cannot substantiate, or state as fact, something which is in reality your opinion. "PC Computers Ltd took my money and ran" may well be your opinion, but an action for libel by the company would almost certainly succeed, and PC Advisor may be jointly liable as the publishers of your comment. We aren't prepared to take such risks, and will delete any comment that is, in our opinion, potentially libellous or defamatory. The editor's decision is final in such cases.
</li><li><b>'Cracks' or copyright infringement</b> - we do not permit the posting of information that will enable other people to use pirated software or to evade the copyright laws. Please do not post serial numbers or CD keys, or links to sites that contain file-sharing software or such information.</li></ul><p>


<b>Our editorial policy</b><br><br>

Our membership is representative of all levels of computing, from beginner to expert, and no matter what your problem, there will almost certainly be someone who can help. We intend to maintain this 'mutual-help' atmosphere, we think computer users like it that way, and we will do our best to see that everyone is welcomed - no matter what their level of computer-literacy.<br><br>
If at any time you are uncertain about how to get help, or if there is anything about forum conduct that you find confusing, please don't hesitate to let us know. Click the 'Contact moderator' button, and send us an email. We'll do our best to respond quickly, but we receive a lot of email - bear with us. We want to hear from you if you have an idea for an improvement, or some extra content. We can't promise to translate your ideas into action, but we'll look into every proposal or suggestion.
