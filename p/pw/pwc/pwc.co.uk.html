<h1>PricewaterhouseCoopers Privacy Commitment </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the UK firm) (“PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP” or 
“we”) is strongly committed to privacy issues, and this privacy statement 
details our approach on such issues. By using this site and submitting any 
personal data, you agree to the use by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP of such data 
in accordance with this privacy statement. If you have questions on privacy 
issues, please email us at <a title="Email privacy team" href="mailto:privacy@pwc.com" target="_blank">privacy@pwc.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Data collection</h2>
<p>We only collect identifiable personal data or information that is 
specifically and voluntarily provided by a visitor to our site. For example, a 
visitor to our site may choose to provide information such as name, title, 
office address, office email address and telephone number in order to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>register for certain areas of the site; 
  </li><li>contact us for further information; 
  </li><li>participate in "join our mailing list" initiatives </li></ul>
<p>Visitors are also able to send email to us through the site. Their messages 
will contain the user’s screen name and email address, as well as any additional 
information the user may wish to include in the message.</p>

<h2>Use of data</h2>
<p>When a visitor provides personal data to us, we use it solely for the 
purposes for which it was provided to us as stated at the point of collection 
(or as is obvious from the context of collection). Examples of the types of use 
are given in the ‘data collection’ section above.</p>
<p>Our websites do not collect or compile personally identifying information for 
dissemination or sale to outside parties for consumer marketing purposes, or 
host mailings on behalf of third parties.</p>

<h2>Data controller</h2>
<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the limited liability partnership registered in 
England under registration no. OC303525 and with its registered address at 1 
Embankment Place, London WC2N 6RH) is the data controller of any personal data 
collected through this website, and will process such data in accordance with 
the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

<h2>Disclosure to third parties</h2>
<p>Our policy is not to share personally identifiable information with any third 
parties, unless required by law, or unless explicitly requested by a visitor or 
otherwise as set out in this section. We recognise that your information is 
valuable and we take all reasonable measures to protect your information while 
it is in our care.</p>
<p>Personal data which has been submitted to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (UK 
firm) may be disclosed to other member firms in the PricewaterhouseCoopers 
network of firms, where this is necessary to meet the purpose for which the 
visitor has submitted the information. By submitting personal data to this site, 
the visitor is providing explicit consent to the transfer of such data for the 
fulfilment of their voluntary requests.</p>
<p>This data is not shared with any member firms in the PricewaterhouseCoopers 
network of firms for any secondary or unrelated purposes, or shared with any 
third party, unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection. If there is 
an instance where such information may be shared, the visitor will be asked for 
permission beforehand.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We have implemented generally accepted standards of technology and 
operational security in order to protect personally identifiable data and 
information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. In particular, we 
ensure that all appropriate confidentiality obligations and technical and 
organisational security measures are in place to prevent any unauthorised or 
unlawful disclosure or processing of such information and data and the 
accidental loss or destruction of or damage to such information and data. Only 
authorised PricewaterhouseCoopers personnel are provided access to personally 
identifiable information and these employees have agreed to ensure 
confidentiality of this information. PricewaterhouseCoopers’ policy is to use 
secure socket layer technology for the protection of credit card information 
submitted through web forms.</p>

<h2>Access to information</h2>
<p>If you would like to update any personal data you have submitted through this 
site, please do so via the original registration page or please email us at <a title="Email privacy team" href="mailto:privacy@pwc.com" target="_blank">privacy@pwc.com</a>.</p>
<p>When personally identifiable information is retained, we do not assume 
responsibility for verifying the ongoing accuracy of the content of personal 
information. When practically possible, if PricewaterhouseCoopers is informed 
that any personal data collected through a Web site is no longer accurate, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers will make appropriate corrections based on the updated 
information provided by the authenticated visitor.</p>
<p>If you would like details of the information which you have submitted to us 
through this site, you have a right of access to such information and you may 
contact us via the above email address. We may charge for a request for access 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.</p>

<h2>Unsubscribe</h2><p>Should visitors subsequently choose to 
unsubscribe from mailing lists or any registrations, we will provide 
instructions, on the appropriate webpage or in communications to our visitors, 
or a visitor may contact by email to <a title="Email privacy team" href="mailto:privacy@pwc.com" target="_blank">privacy@pwc.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Data retention </h2>
<p>The personal data you submit to us will only be retained for as long as is 
required for the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law.</p>
<p>For example, contact information about visitors (such as information 
generated though registration for access to areas on the site) will be kept as 
long as the information is required to completely service the contact request or 
until a user requests that we delete that information. Mailing list information, 
discussion posts and email are kept for only the period of time considered 
reasonable to facilitate the visitor’s requests.</p>

<h2>Cookies and log files</h2>
<p>We use small text files called ‘cookies’ which are placed on your hard drives 
to assist in providing a more customised website experience. For example, a 
cookie can be used to store registration information in an area of the site so 
that a user does not need to re-enter it on subsequent visits to that area. 
Site statistics are compiled by third parties, and therefore your IP address will be passed to third parties for statistical reporting only.</p>
<p>The use of cookies is now standard operating procedure for most websites. 
However if you are uncomfortable with the use of cookies, most browsers now 
permit users to opt-out of receiving them. In that case you will be unable to 
use this registration process and may find other functionality in the site impaired. After termination of the visit to our site, you can always delete the cookie from your system if you wish. </p><a href="javascript:window.close();"><font color="#000000">Close Window</font></a></div>
