            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <h2>Changes to the Policy</h2>

            <p>
                If there are changes made to our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy policy,
                the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect,
                how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to modify this
                privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy,
                we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the change(s) coming into effect.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Files</h2>
            <p>
                Most of the services offered by us require you to upload a copy of one or more files to our server where they are processed.
                <span class="punchline">
                    Files uploaded by you and any copies produced while processing them are temporarily stored for your convenience and not made
                    available to anyone else. We do not store any of the content in your files.
                </span> Files are automatically deleted daily from our server.
            </p>
            <h2>Use of Your Personal Information</h2>
            <p>
                To fulfill your transaction requests, you must allow us to use your personal information to identify you as a client.
                If you make a purchase or a donation via PayPal, we also receive some personal informationabout you and store your name and email address.

            </p>


            <h2>Information Security</h2>
            <p>
                The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to
                protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
                No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
                Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information,
                we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>

            <h2>Legal Disclosure</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to disclose your personal
                information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights
                and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.
                We will retain and use your information as necessary to provide you services and to comply with our
