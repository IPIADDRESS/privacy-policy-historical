      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p><b>Effective Date: December 10, 2011</b></p>

      <p>We only processes personal information for the
        purposes described in the applicable Privacy Policy and/or privacy notice for specific services. Such
        purposes
        include:</p>
      <ul><font size="-1">
        <li>Providing our products and services to users, including the display of customized content and
          advertising;
        </li><li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;
        </li><li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and
        </li></font><li><font size="-1">Developing new services.
      </font></li></ul>
      <p>We processes personal information on our servers. In some cases, we process personal information on a
        server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. .</p>

      <p><b>Information
        security</b></p>

      <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
        alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection,
        storage and
        processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against
        unauthorized
        access to systems where we store personal data.</p>

      <p>We restrict access to personal information to our employees,
        contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our
        services. These
        individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination
        and
        criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

      <p><b>Data integrity</b></p>

      <p>We processes
        personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or
        any
        applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices
        to
        ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our
        services.
        We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and
        current, but
        we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>

      <p><b>Accessing and
        updating personal information</b></p>

      <p>When you use our services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with
        access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such
        data at
        your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We
        ask
        individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed
        before
        processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or
        systematic,
        require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely
        impractical (for
        instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise
        required.
        In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge,
        except if
        doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access,
        correct
        or delete users' personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy
        notices
        or FAQs for these services.</p>

      <p><b>Changes to this policy</b></p>

      <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may
        change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent,
        and we
        expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the
        changes
        are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email
        notification of
        Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective
        date.</p>
