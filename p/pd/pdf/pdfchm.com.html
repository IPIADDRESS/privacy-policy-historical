        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><b>Effective Date: December 10, 2011</b></p>

        <p>We only processes personal information for the
            purposes described in the applicable Privacy Policy and/or privacy notice for specific services. Such
            purposes
            include:</p>
        <ul><font size="-1">
            <li>Providing our products and services to users, including the display of customized content and
                advertising;
            </li><li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;
            </li><li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and
            </li></font><li><font size="-1">Developing new services.
        </font></li></ul>
        <p>We processes personal information on our servers. In some cases, we process personal information on a
            server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. .</p>

        <p><b>Information
            security</b></p>

        <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
            alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection,
            storage and
            processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against
            unauthorized
            access to systems where we store personal data.</p>

        <p>We restrict access to personal information to our employees,
            contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our
            services. These
            individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination
            and
            criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

        <p><b>Data integrity</b></p>

        <p>We processes
            personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or
            any
            applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices
            to
            ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our
            services.
            We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and
            current, but
            we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>

        <p><b>Accessing and
            updating personal information</b></p>

        <p>When you use our services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with
            access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such
            data at
            your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We
            ask
            individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed
            before
            processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or
            systematic,
            require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely
            impractical (for
            instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise
            required.
            In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge,
            except if
            doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access,
            correct
            or delete users' personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy
            notices
            or FAQs for these services.</p>

        <p><b>Changes to this policy</b></p>

        <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may
            change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent,
            and we
            expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the
            changes
            are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email
            notification of
            Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective
            date.</p>
