                <p><b>Traffic Data.</b> <span>PDFSimpli may collect a variety of visitor data such as IP addresses, browser settings, internet service provider (ISP) information, referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, and clickstream data (collectively “Visitor Data”). The PDFSimpli internal servers and software automatically recognize Visitor Data. The Site may use Visitor Data to compile traffic data about the types of visitors who use the Site at specific intervals (collectively “Traffic Data”). We may use Traffic Data to analyze Site traffic, but this information is not examined for Personally Identifiable Information. We may also use Traffic Data to diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, or display content according to your preferences. Visitor Data and Traffic Data may also be shared with business partners, affiliates, or advertisers on an aggregated and anonymous basis.</span></p>

                <p><b>Cookies.</b> <span>PDFSimpli and its partners may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party providers, including Google Analytics features (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting), or employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, that allow PDFSimpli to store a small piece of data on a visitor’s computer, or any other device a visitor uses to access Online Services, about his or her visit to the Site or use of Applications. PDFSimpli does not capture Personally Identifiable Information in cookies or use cookies to mine Personally Identifiable Information. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.</span> <span> To manage Flash cookies, please click here:<a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html </a> </span></p>

                <p><b>Web Beacons.</b> <span> We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons), that help us track referrals from our partners and affiliates and better manage content on our site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</span></p>

                <p><span><b>3rd Party Tracking.</b> The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media links) on the site is not covered by our Privacy Policy. These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site. We do not have access or control over these technologies. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ Personally Identifiable Information.</span></p>

                <p><span><b>Personal Information.</b> PDFSimpli requires each customer to provide us with personal information (collectively “Personally Identifiable Information”) to access and use PDFSimpli products and services. Personally Identifiable Information is captured when a visitor accesses Online Services, or speaks on the phone with a PDFSimpli employee, and willingly discloses that information. This disclosure may occur when a visitor registers with an Online Service, engages in transactions, contacts customer service, or participates in contests, promotions, surveys, forums, content submissions, requests for suggestions, or other aspects of services offered by PDFSimpli.</span></p>
                <p><span>Personally Identifiable Information includes but is not limited to: (i) “Contact Data” (such as your name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and email address); (ii) “Financial Data” (such as your credit card number, expiration date, and verification code or bank account information); (iii) “Demographic Data” (such as your zip code and sex); and (iv) other “Legal Data” (such as your social security number, mortgage information, automobile information, marital information, trade secrets, inventions, and idea submissions and other sensitive information necessary to generate legal documents).</span></p>

                <p><span>We may collect the information of 3rd party individuals as necessary, such as to ask our customers to indicate beneficiaries of a will, record shareholders of a company, or register authorized contacts to access their PDFSimpli account. PDFSimpli uses this information for the sole purpose of administering its services for our customers, and does not use such information for any other reason.</span></p>
                <p><span>If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us at support@PDFSimpli.com.</span></p>

                <p><b>Testimonials and Reviews.</b> We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers received through email surveys. We ask for your specific consent as part of the survey. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at support@PDFSimpli.com. We also display customer reviews. If you provide a review that we display and wish to update or delete it, you can also contact us at support@PDFSimpli.com.</p>
                <p><span>Calls/Electronic Communications. In the regular course of our business, PDFSimpli may monitor and record phone conversations or email communications between you and PDFSimpli employees for training and quality assurance purposes. We may receive a confirmation when you open or click on content in an email from us, which helps us make our communications to you more useful and interesting. If you do not wish to receive email from PDFSimpli, you may unsubscribe from our mailing list by using the “Unsubscribe” link on any of the emails we send.</span></p>

                <h3>Use of Information</h3>
                <p><span>We use information we collect from the Online Services to communicate with you, process your orders, facilitate your transactions with our third-party marketing partners, and inform you of offers and discounts. For example, you may receive a welcome email that confirms your username and password, and later receive communications responding to your inquiries, providing services you request, and managing your account. We occasionally send service-related announcements, for example, to alert you if we need to temporarily suspend the Site for maintenance.</span></p>

            <p><strong>b)</strong> <strong>Service Providers and Other Third Parties:</strong> We can disclose your information to service providers under contract, which help with our business operations (such as, but not limited to, fraud investigations, bill collection and payment processing, and site <a href="https://pdfsimpli.com/cookie-policy" target="_blank">analytics and operations</a>). Also, we share information with our third-party payment processors.   With your authorisation, we can also share your information with potential employers and career/job-posting websites.</p>

            <p><strong>c)</strong> <strong>Other Entities, with your Consent:</strong> We can share your Personal Information with third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (such as CV editors, employers, recruiters or job-posting third-party websites, or others about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service). These third party services are governed by their own terms of service and privacy policies, as set forth by the third parties that provide them. We do not necessarily endorse, nor are we responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for those services. On the Site, you have opportunities to express an interest in, or register for, other products and services. If you do, we will provide information about you to these third parties, or parties working on their behalf, to implement your request.</p>

            <p><strong>d)</strong> <strong>Legal and Law Enforcement:</strong> Law enforcement, governmental agencies or authorised third parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, or any other activity that can expose us, you or any other Provider user to legal liability.

            <p><strong>e)</strong> <strong>Change of Control – New Owners:</strong> Other business entities, should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by, that business entity. Should such a combination occur, we will make reasonable efforts to request the new combined entity to follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your Personal Information.

            <p><strong>f)</strong> <strong>Ad Networks:</strong> On the Site, we can work with third parties to serve advertisement, provide us with data collection, reporting, ad-response measurement and site analytics, and assist with the delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties can view, edit or set their own tracking technology/cookies. The use of this technology by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy Policy. They can also obtain information about other applications that you have downloaded to your mobile device, the mobile websites that you visit and other information about you or your device, in order to analyse and serve anonymous, targeted advertising on the Site and elsewhere.

            <h3>6. Information You Share on the Site.</h3>

            <p>If you participate in Provider services (e.g. CV posting, profile creation and job alerts) that permit you or the Provider, on your behalf, to post information on third-party sites (e.g. websites, bulletin boards and personal URLs), and if you post information or content, such as by posting photos, or participating in online forums or communities, when you interact with our Site through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, depending upon your privacy settings, this information can become public on the Internet. We cannot prevent the further use of this information. You can control the data that you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. Please refer to these third-party sites' privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, which we do not control.</p>

            <p><strong>a)</strong> <strong>Other services:</strong> If you use the Site, the Provider can create a universal application derived from the information you provide on the Site that will be visible to potential employers who have immediate needs for prospects, as well as visitors to the Site. Therefore, your Site Profile can be publicly viewable. You can elect to have your Profile restricted to registered users only by following the instructions on the Site for that particular setting. You agree that employers and the Provider will use the contact information you have provided to contact you by email and/or SMS text, and you understand that this consent is not a condition to having access to the Site or the Provider's services. Messaging and data rates can apply. If you opt in to our SMS alert service, you acknowledge that message or data charges may apply. If you do not wish to continue with the SMS alert service, you may opt out by replying 'STOP' to the SMS text that you have received, or you may contact our customer service.  Please allow three to five working days for us to process your request.  The Provider reserves the right to terminate the SMS alert service, at its sole discretion, for any reason and at any time.</p>

                    <p>We can target and track the videos that you view on the Site. You consent to our trackingof your video viewing through the Site, or on third-party social media, for up to two years or as permitted by applicable law.</p>

            <h3>Notice to California Residents</h3>

            <p><strong>a)</strong> California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the 'Shine the light' law, permits those of our customers who are residents of California to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information (if any) we have disclosed to third parties for direct-marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, and the names and addresses of these third parties. Requests can be made only once a year and are free of charge. To make such a request, please contact us at  <a href="mailto:californiarequest@legalsimpli.com">californiarequest@legalsimpli.com</a>. For all requests, you must put the statement 'Your California privacy rights' in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. You need to attest to the fact that you are a resident of California and provide a current address in California for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, by post or via facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labelled or sent properly, or that do not contain complete information.</p>

            <p><strong>b)</strong> California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575 (b) provides that California residents are entitled to know how the Provider responds to 'Do not track' browser settings. The Provider does not currently take action to respond to Do not track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been adopted. We continue to review new technology and may adopt a standard once one is universally accepted.</p>

            <p><a id="policySection10"></a></p>

            <h3>Notice to residents of the European Union</h3>

            <p>The Provider complies with the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'). As such, the Provider affords to all European data subjects their respective data privacy rights to the extent that they are applicable, including: (i) the right to rectify inaccurate data; (ii) the right to erasure (deletion of your Personal Information); (iii) the right to restrict processing of your Personal Information; (iv) the right of data portability; and (v) the right to object. You can exercise any of these rights by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@legalsimpli.com">privacy@legalsimpli.com</a> or <a href="https://pdfsimpli.com/privacy-policy#policySection16">contact-us</a>. In order to safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorised access, we can ask that you provide sufficient information to identify yourself prior to providing access to your Personal Information.</p>

            <p>In certain situations, and subject to applicable law, the Provider will not be able or obliged to comply with part or all of your individual requests. Please note that we have the right to refuse and/or charge a monetary fee for requests that are manifestly unfounded or excessive, for example due to their repetitive character. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU supervisory authority. </p>

            <p>Providing your information to us is optional, but it can affect our ability to offer you the Service. For example, if you do not provide your complete Personal Information, we will not always be able to respond to your request in a timely manner. </p>

            <p><a id="policySection11"></a></p>

            <h3>Third Parties</h3>

            <p>
                Our Site can contain links to other third-party websites, and the Provider can provide products and services that share information with third-party sites for your job search. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party sites, so it is important to familiarise yourself with their privacy policies before providing your Personal Information.
                <a id="policySection12"></a>
            </p>

            <h3>Information security</h3>

            <p>We maintain technical, physical and administrative security measures designed to protect the security of your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorised or accidental access, disclosure, copying, use or alteration. Some of the safeguards that we use are firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centres, information access authorisation controls and other measures in accordance with industry standards. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is totally secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>

            <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

            <h3>14. Storage and International Transfer</h3>

            <p>As we operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based globally, for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information can be stored and processed elsewhere by us, our affiliates or an unaffiliated service provider. The data protection and privacy regulations do not always offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Economic Area ('EEA'). When you create an account/profile or otherwise provide us with Personal Information, you consent to the collection, storage and/or processing, in the United States and other countries, of your Personal Information and tracking technology/cookies as described in this Policy.  We take appropriate measures to ensure adequate protection of the privacy rights of EEA data subjects with respect to Personal Information that we transfer outside the EEA to a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission. To obtain a copy of the relevant transfer mechanism or additional information on the transfers, please address these requests to <a href="https://pdfsimpli.com/privacy-policy#policySection16">contact-us</a>. </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>BlueSnap Respects Your Privacy </strong></p>
            <p>
                <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
                This website and related services are owned and operated by BlueSnap, Inc. (“BlueSnap”) a global company providing <a href="https://home.bluesnap.com/payment-gateway/">payment gateway</a> services and enabling eCommerce, marketing and payment processing, together with various subsidiaries including a European Union subsidiary BlueSnap Payment Services Limited, Canadian subsidiary BlueSnap Enterprise Canada ULC and Australian subsidiary BlueSnap Australia Pty Limited. References to BlueSnap in this policy also include these subsidiaries unless otherwise stated. Additional subsidiaries may be added over time and shall be governed by the terms of this policy.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We understand that you care about how your information is used and shared when you enter it on our websites, <a href="http://www.bluesnap.com/">www.bluesnap.com</a>, or use BlueSnap’s payment services as a merchant or shopper, and this notice describes our privacy policy and practices.</p>
            <p>BlueSnap respects each individual’s right to personal privacy. We will collect and use information through our website including registration forms, inquiry forms, product transaction forms, mobile and API services only in the ways disclosed in this statement.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Online payment transactions involve transfer of data across international borders, as well backing up of data at our secured data centers in the EU and USA. This means that data may be transferred, processed and stored outside the EU, the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. By submitting your data directly or through a third party such as a merchant you are agreeing to such transfer, processing and storage.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>BlueSnap is committed to maintaining the principles of transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. BlueSnap Inc., is certified with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework full details of which appear in the dedicated section below.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When using BlueSnap’s services, technologies, functions, web site or applications, the terms of this policy will apply.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>BlueSnap Services and You</strong></p>
            <p>BlueSnap acts as a technology provider supplying secure online and mobile digital payment processing services to businesses known as <em>merchants</em> so that they can sell their goods and services to their shoppers both domestically and worldwide.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The personal information collected by BlueSnap depends on how you are using our services.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em>Individuals typically interface with BlueSnap in one of the following ways: </em></p>
            <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
            <p><strong><em>Site Visitor:</em></strong> <em>If you are visiting our website for details about our products and services, you may be asked to enter your personal details on an online form to receive more information. Cookies may be used to track site usage to assist in product development or monitor behavior for marketing purposes. Visitors from the EU/EEA may initially be asked to expressly consent to cookie usage.</em></p>
            <p><strong><em>Merchant:</em></strong><em> you may be a business customer that has consented to BlueSnap’s terms of service under a merchant or other formal agreement and use BlueSnap to conduct secure online sales. To set up a merchant account you will need to provide personal details, business data and identifying documentation.</em></p>
            <p><strong><em>Shopper:</em></strong><em> You may be a business or consumer using BlueSnap’s secure online payment technologies to complete the purchase of goods and services from a merchant that has selected BlueSnap as its payments solution. Your own choice of payment method will usually determine what personal data is passed to BlueSnap to enable your payment transaction to take place. It could be name, address and credit/debit card details, electronic bank transfer information, or pay-wallet credentials if using a service such as PayPal.</em></p>
            <p><em>While such secure transactions may be completed in just a few seconds they are often complicated by the fact that live anti-fraud checks need to be conducted. Data also has to be passed to the relevant payment processors; banks, payment card and payment account services may need to be notified; legal tax invoices generated, and transaction confirmations delivered. Some or all of these steps may all involve the transfer and sharing of personal data down a chain of service providers, as well as the use of tracking cookies.</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>The Information BlueSnap Collects </strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The types of personal information we may obtain or you may choose to provide include:</p>

                <li>When BlueSnap acts as payment service provider, merchant and/or reseller for product suppliers, we may need to share relevant customer information with the specific merchant/product supplier involved in the transaction in order for them to fulfill the transaction. Such information is supplied on the condition that it will not be used for spamming or direct marketing by another party. Occasionally such product suppliers may sell, transfer or assign their business to new owners and in such circumstances data records may be accessible to the new owners subject to such parties satisfying the underwriting requirements of BlueSnap and assuming the ongoing responsibility for the proper protection of such data by committing to relevant contractual provisions</li>

                <li>Track and identify sales referred by merchants’ sales affiliates and marketplace sellers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We may also use information in other ways for which we provide specific notice of at the time of collection.</p>

            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>International Entities</strong></p>
            <p>BlueSnap’s services enable merchants to sell to shoppers across the world. This sometimes requires BlueSnap to provide services through specific legal entities. BlueSnap Inc., is based in the USA, and its affiliate BlueSnap Payment Services Ltd., is a regulated UK payments institution offering payment services across the EU/EEA. BlueSnap Enterprise Canada ULC offers payment services to Canadian merchants. BlueSnap Australia Pty Limited offers payment services to Australian merchants. Additional BlueSnap entities may be added and shall automatically be covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>How and Where Information is Stored</strong></p>
            <p>BlueSnap maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information provided or collected against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or misuse. Data is also routinely backed up at secure locations in Europe and the US in accordance with standard industry practice. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any further questions about privacy or security, or have reason to believe your data security has been compromised please contact us immediately by sending an email to:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Security@bluesnap.com">Security@bluesnap.com</a>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The international nature of BlueSnap’s services means that personal data may be transferred beyond your national borders when you use BlueSnap’s services or purchase from or sell to persons or entities outside your country. By using such services you are deemed to understand and accept that data may be subject to cross-border transfers.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>How long data is retained </strong></p>
            <p>BlueSnap stores personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the personal information was collected and as required or authorized by law. We take measures to delete or permanently de-identify personal information as required by law or if no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. Certain data relating to transaction records particularly billing and invoice information may be required to be safeguarded for significant periods of time in accordance with standard tax and accounting practices, or to enable the refund and chargeback requests to be processed on behalf of shoppers.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Sharing of Personal Information</strong></p>
            <p>BlueSnap does not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy or as may be disclosed to you at the time information is collected.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>BlueSnap may share personal information collected with its subsidiaries and other BlueSnap entities that process payment transactions as well as relevant merchants, fraud prevention services, card and payment services, and payment processors/acquirers.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>BlueSnap may share certain information with service providers who provide or perform services on behalf of BlueSnap. We authorize such services providers to use or disclose such information only as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. Such entities are required by contract to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information processed on our behalf. We may also share personal information with other parties with your <strong>express </strong> consent.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Personal data used with respect to payment transactions involving individuals of the EU/EEA often needs to be passed to other parties as part of the transaction process. Transfers of data may be through APIs, email, and other formats, and may be bi-directional. BlueSnap takes steps to ensure that such parties are committed to compliance with applicable data law including the GDPR and that any additional Data Processors or Sub-Processors used are retained under a contractual duty of compliance and are able to respond to data subject access requests. In certain situations, BlueSnap and its subsidiaries might be deemed to be acting on the instruction of other transaction services or together with such parties, in which case BlueSnap shall itself be obligated to act in a manner compliant with applicable data law.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Certain Merchants might use checkout and other systems as part of the payment transaction process that might be integrated with BlueSnap. Accordingly personal information that you provide to such services either directly or through your selected Merchant might be passed to BlueSnap.  BlueSnap treats such personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, however other entities might have their own policies and these should be thoroughly checked by you.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>BlueSnap may use third-party service providers, for example to provide you with support when using our site and including the use of live chat software. When you sign up for our services we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service. Personal information collected relating to marketing and Merchant underwriting functions may be stored and processed on secure compliant cloud-based services provided by third parties to BlueSnap. Such service providers are contractually required by BlueSnap to act in compliance with relevant data law.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Merger, sale and/or transfer of corporate assets or reorganization</strong></p>
            <p>BlueSnap may transfer information as part of any corporate merger, sale, acquisition, transfer or assets or reorganization without notice. Such transfer will be on the basis of the continuation of all privacy rights set out in this document. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in BlueSnap ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Compliance with court orders &amp; law enforcement agencies</strong></p>
            <p>BlueSnap may be required to disclose personal information without notification in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security requirements, or in order to comply with a legal requirement, legislation, regulation, court order or subpoena, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, prevent harm of financial loss, protect your safety or the safety of others or investigate fraud or cooperate with law enforcement or government agencies, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>EU/EEA Data Privacy Law</strong></p>
            <p>With respect to data protection legislation in the European Economic Area, including the GDPR, BlueSnap acts as ‘Data Processor’ concerning shopper information of EU/EEA-based persons that is transmitted to BlueSnap either through a merchant or directly in order to process a purchase transaction.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When BlueSnap sets up an account for a merchant we are required to conduct to various payment security, anti-money laundering, credit and KYC checks. When managing such personal data with respect to EEA-based individuals BlueSnap acts as a ‘Data Controller’.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The UK-based subsidiary, BlueSnap Payment Services Limited is authorized by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under the Payments Services Regulations 2009 reference no. 629580, for the provision of payment services.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>EU/EEA-based users will be asked to expressly consent to provision of personal information or initial setting of cookies when visiting BlueSnap web properties so that there is a clear legal basis for processing such data. In other cases personal information will be processed legally by virtue of the performance of the contractual obligations relating to a merchant and/or shopper, BlueSnap’s legitimate interest, or the defense or preservation of BlueSnap’s legal rights.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>BlueSnap complies with legal requirements to provide adequate safeguards for the transfers of personal data outside the EU/EEA and Switzerland, and is certified under the EU/EEA-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield schemes.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Individual users from the EU/EEA or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, should note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal information to the United States and other jurisdictions in which BlueSnap may operate. By providing your personal information with respect to a transaction or express consent mechanism, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Individuals based in the EU/EEA have additional statutory data subject rights as shown below under the heading: <strong>EU/EEA Data Subject Rights</strong></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>EU and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you.&nbsp; Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you.&nbsp; You may also may correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you.&nbsp; An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct their query to <a href="mailto:PrivacyOptions@bluesnap.com">PrivacyOptions@bluesnap.com</a>.&nbsp; If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

            <p>Your right to access your personal data may be restricted in exceptional circumstances, including, but not limited to, when the burden or expense of providing this access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or when the rights of persons other than you would be violated by the provision of such access.  If we determine that your access should be restricted in a particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of our determination and respond to any inquiries you may have.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We will also provide an individual opt-out or opt-in choice before we share their data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.&nbsp; To limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to <a href="mailto:PrivacyOptions@bluesnap.com">PrivacyOptions@bluesnap.com</a></p>
