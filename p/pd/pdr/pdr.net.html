        <h1>PDR NETWORK, LLC</h1>
        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
        <strong>Revised October 16, 2010</strong>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy is  designed to tell you how PDR Network, LLC (“PDR Network”, “we” or “us”) secures  and uses the personal information collected from individuals including  healthcare professionals in connection with PDR Network’s products and  services. In particular, the statement  describes how PDR Network handles personal information collected via the  www.pdr.net Web site, other Web sites that link to this privacy statement, online  registration, and offline PDR surveys, etc. By using this site or any of the  PDR Network services, you indicate your acceptance of PDR Network’s Privacy  Policy.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            Your trust is our greatest  asset. We make every reasonable effort to ensure that information held by PDR  Network-powered Web sites is confidential and secure. We disclose our  information-security practices to you as clearly and fully as possible. These  practices receive continuous oversight, and many of our business decisions,  including Web design, technology selections, and third-party business  relationships, begin and end with considerations for your privacy.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to Policy</h2>
        <p>
            While our philosophy will  not change, the details of the policy, including how we use customer  information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this  privacy statement may change over time. If we make a material change to our  policy, we will post and highlight the policy changes, and we will also notify  you via e-mail or take other reasonable steps to give you an opportunity to  opt-out of the new data uses. Please  refer back to this page regularly. The date the policy was last revised will  always appear at the top of the policy pages.
        </p>
        <h2>Site Ownership, Scope, and  Applicability of the Policy</h2>
        <p>
            This Policy applies only  when you are within the PDR Network-branded environment and only to information  that PDR Network collects. Please note  that our Web sites may provide direct links to various sponsor and marketing  partner sites. This privacy statement  does not describe the practices of these parties. Before disclosing personal  information to any third party, you should read the privacy notice associated  with that site, as PDR Network has no control over  information submitted to or collected by such third parties.<br>
            Note: Other PDR Network Web  sites (including consumer-focused sites such as www.pdrhealth.com and  www.pdrbookstore.com) and services (such as the bookstore) are controlled by  their own privacy statements. These can  be obtained by clicking on the Web site privacy policy link or contacting  customer service at the number below.
        </p>
        <h2>Information that We  Collect</h2>
        <p>
            In general, you may visit  this Web site without providing any personal information. The information we  collect from Web site visitors is collected on an aggregate basis, and is not  used to identify you in any way.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to interact  with PDR Network online and take advantage of the materials available on the PDR  Network Web site for qualified professionals (such as the annual PDR® print  book and FDA-approved PDR Drug Alerts), you may register and join the PDR Network professional community. Registration is voluntary and free to  qualified professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you join the PDR  Network professional community, we collect contact information (such as name,  office address, office phone and fax numbers, and e-mail address), and other  personal information (such as information about your professional background,  licensure, practice, and areas of specialization as well as any other personal  information that you choose to provide us).        
        </p>
        <p>
            We will tailor the  materials we provide you based on the information in your profile, such as your  specialty. Please note that certain products (such as the PDR® Book, FDA-approved PDR Drug Alerts,  and sampling services) may only available to qualified, credentialed professionals, so you  may not receive access to all of the services we offer if we cannot confirm  your qualifications for them.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a registered  user of PDR Network products and services, we will also collect and use  activity statistics so we can understand the ways in which our sites and services  are being utilized. For example, we will record information about the PDR  activities in which you participate, newsletters you subscribe to, and Web sites,  tools and other services that you use. Activity related data is stored anonymously and it is only used in the  form of aggregated statistics. This aggregated, anonymous data may also be  shared with business partners. Activity related data cannot be used to target  you with solicitations of any kind.      
        </p>
        <p>
            None of our sites or services are directed at children, and we make every reasonable effort  to ensure that we do not accept personal information from persons under 13  years of age.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>In general, we use the information we collect in order to:</p>

           <li>Provide customer service</li>
           <li>Provide you with additional information that may be of interest, including marketing and educational materials from us and our partners</li>

        <p>
            We have implemented  reasonable technical, physical, and administrative controls to help prevent the  loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.
