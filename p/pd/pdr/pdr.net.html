	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1> <p><strong>Updated: February 4, 2014</strong> </p>
This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you how PDR Network, LLC (“PDR Network”, “we” or “us”) secures and uses the personal information collected from individuals including healthcare professionals in connection with PDR Network’s products and services.&nbsp; In particular, the statement describes how PDR Network handles personal information collected via the www.pdr.net Web site, other Web sites that link to this privacy statement, online registration, and offline PDR surveys, etc. By using this site or any of the PDR Network services, you indicate your acceptance of PDR Network’s Privacy Policy. &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Our Philosophy &nbsp; </strong><br>
Your trust is our greatest asset. We make every reasonable effort to ensure that information held by PDR Network-powered Web sites is confidential and secure. We disclose our information-security practices to you as clearly and fully as possible. These practices receive continuous oversight, and many of our business decisions, including Web design, technology selections, and third-party business relationships, begin and end with considerations for your privacy. &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Changes to Policy</strong> &nbsp; <br>
While our philosophy will not change, the details of the policy, including how we use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this privacy statement may change over time. If we make a material change to our policy, we will post and highlight the policy changes, and we will also notify you via e-mail or take other reasonable steps to give you an opportunity to opt-out of the new data uses.&nbsp; Please refer back to this page regularly. The date the policy was last revised will always appear at the top of the policy pages.  &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Site Ownership, Scope, and Applicability of the Policy </strong>&nbsp; <br>
This Policy applies only when you are within the PDR Network-branded environment and only to information that PDR Network collects.&nbsp; Please note that our Web sites may provide direct links to various sponsor and marketing partner sites.&nbsp; This privacy statement does not describe the practices of these parties. Before disclosing personal information to any third party, you should read the privacy notice associated with that site, as PDR Network has no control over information submitted to or collected by such third parties. &nbsp; <br> <br>
Note: Other PDR Network Web sites (including consumer-focused sites such as www.pdrhealth.com and www.pdrbookstore.com) and services (such as the bookstore) are controlled by their own privacy statements.&nbsp; These can be obtained by clicking on the Web site privacy policy link or contacting customer service at the number below. &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Information that We Collect </strong>&nbsp; <br>
In general, you may visit this Web site without providing any personal information. The information we collect from Web site visitors is collected on an aggregate basis, and is not used to identify you in any way. &nbsp; <br> <br>
If you want to interact with PDR Network online and take advantage of the materials available on the PDR Network Web site for qualified professionals (such as the annual PDR® print book and FDA-approved PDR Drug Alerts), you may register and join the PDR Network professional community.&nbsp; Registration is voluntary and free to qualified professionals.&nbsp; Your email or fax number will only be used to send and administer Drug and Device Alert services, FDA-approved drug labeling information, and other clinically-relevant PDR services/information. &nbsp; <br> <br>
When you join the PDR Network professional community, we collect contact information (such as name, office address, office phone and fax numbers, and e-mail address), and other personal information (such as information about your professional background, licensure, practice, and areas of specialization as well as any other personal information that you choose to provide us). &nbsp; <br> <br>
We will tailor the materials we provide you based on the information in your profile, such as your specialty. Please note that certain products (such as the PDR® Book, FDA-approved PDR Drug Alerts,&nbsp; and sampling services) may only available to qualified, credentialed professionals, so you may not receive access to all of the services we offer if we cannot confirm your qualifications for them. &nbsp; <br> <br>
If you are a registered user of PDR Network products and services, we will also collect and use activity statistics so we can understand the ways in which our sites and services are being utilized. For example, we will record information about the PDR activities in which you participate, newsletters you subscribe to, and Web sites, tools and other services that you use.&nbsp; Activity related data is stored anonymously and it is only used in the form of aggregated statistics. This aggregated, anonymous data may also be shared with business partners. Activity related data cannot be used to target you with solicitations of any kind. &nbsp; <br> <br>
None of our sites or services are directed at children, and we make every reasonable effort to ensure that we do not accept personal information from persons under 13 years of age. &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>How We Use Your Information &nbsp;</strong> <br>
In general, we use the information we collect in order to: &nbsp; <br>
- respond to your requests for information <br>
- provide you with products and services, including FDA-approved PDR Drug Alerts  <br>
- determine if you are eligible for certain products or services  <br>
- provide customer service <br>
- provide you with additional information that may be of interest, including marketing and educational materials from us and our partners &nbsp; <br> <br>
If you purchase a product from us (such as a book or newsletter subscription), you may provide us with a credit card number. This credit card number may be stored but will only be used and disclosed as needed to process your purchase. We will not disclose credit card numbers to any third party for marketing purposes under any circumstances. &nbsp; <br> <strong><br>
When We Share Your Information with Others</strong> &nbsp; <br>
We work with business partners to provide the highest-quality services available. We may provide your information to third parties as needed to fulfill your requests for products and services or to facilitate the delivery of appropriate notices to you.&nbsp; For example, if you choose to participate in complimentary pharmaceutical product sampling programs, we will provide your information to the third party as required by the terms of the sampling program. &nbsp; <br> <br>
We do not share or sell e-mail addresses or fax numbers for third party marketing purposes. Unless you tell us not to (i.e. ‘opt-out’), we may provide information about you or your practice to third parties. For example, we share our lists with selected business partners so that they may offer products or services of interest to you. We may also share your information with other third parties who perform services for us, but we, by contract in most cases, prohibit these companies from using your personal information for their own purposes.&nbsp; These companies may only use your information to perform the services on our behalf. &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Special Note Regarding <br>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protected Health Information You May Provide to PDR for Adverse Drug Events </strong><br>
PDR Network operates a service called RxEvent (found in various locations including RxEvent.org) to collect Adverse Drug Event reports ("AERs").&nbsp; In some cases, such AERs provided by end users may include “Protected Health Information" or “PHI” as those terms are defined in 45 C.F.R. Sections 164.501 and 160.103.&nbsp; PDR Network's policies and obligations to receive, store and/or communicate such PHI are governed by law and the agreement/terms of use found at https://rxevent.org/Tos.html. <br> <br> <strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal Information You Provide to PDR for Market Research and Industry-Sponsored Programs  </strong><br>
We, either alone or in connection with third parties, provide highly targeted interactive content and opportunities to participate in industry sponsored programs, market research studies and other programs. When you participate in&nbsp;such programs, your personal information may be shared with the third parties as described below: <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Market Research Studies:</strong></span> From time to time, we may invite you to participate in sponsored or non-sponsored market research studies. When participating in such a survey, in addition to providing your responses to the survey questions, you may be asked to provide additional personal information. This feedback will only be shared in an aggregate manner (e.g. not&nbsp;in a manner that is correlated to your personally identifiable information).   <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Industry Sponsored and Other Programs:</strong></span> From time to time, we may invite you to participate in industry sponsored programs, pharmaceutical sampling programs, e-detailing, sponsored education and similar types of programs.&nbsp; By participating, you agree that your name, location, specialty, profession, the content you read, the answers you provide, and other personal information can be shared with the industry sponsor and/or its agent(s) on the sponsor's behalf. You may be asked to provide personal information and we may collect information in connection with a transaction that you have requested (e.g. requests for information, sales rep visit, etc.) or responses to sponsored program questions, which, along with your identity, will be provided to the program's sponsor. Even if you do not provide us with personal information, we collect non-personally identifiable information about your use of sponsored programs through cookies, as described in the " Cookies and Web Site Information" section of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; When engaging with sponsored content, you should read the privacy policy of the applicable sponsor and familiarize yourself with how such sponsor will treat your information. We are not responsible for how the sponsor and its agents use your information and manage your privacy.&nbsp;  &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Your Choices </strong><br>
We use good faith efforts to respect your preferences about our use and disclosure of your information. We only want to send you information if you want to receive it. We want to communicate with you in the manner that works best for you - whether that is via e-mail, phone, fax, or direct mail. You may change your communication preferences at any time by doing any of the following things: &nbsp; <br>
- updating your profile through the profile link on a PDR Network Web site homepage  <br>
- opting-out of e-mails by using the “unsubscribe” feature on the e-mail communication  <br>
- contacting our customer service department by e-mail at privacy@pdr.net or by phone at 1-888-227-6469 and requesting the desired change (e.g., opting in or out of faxes) &nbsp; <br> <br>
You can also tell us at any time after you register that you do not want us to disclose your information to unaffiliated third parties for their own use by updating your profile through the profile link on a PDR Network Web site homepage, or contacting our customer service department.  &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Accessing Your Information &nbsp; </strong><br>
We strive to provide all our customers with reasonable opportunity to access and update their customer profile information. If you have disclosed information to us via online registration or by updating your profile, you may access and update this information by following the link on a PDR Network Web site homepage to your account profile. Our customer service department can also reasonably assist you with other requests related to information about you that may be maintained by us. &nbsp; <br> <br>
Additionally, if you have registered with the PDR Network previously but have not provided information needed to qualify for a PDR or other services that require credentialing, you may add information to your profile to enable us to qualify you and provide the additional products and services. &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Cookies and Web Site Information </strong>&nbsp; <br>
We use standard "cookie" technology as well as web beacons and web server logs to collect information about how our Web site is used. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by your web browser on your hard drive. The cookies allow our web servers to recognize the computers used to access our Web sites. Cookies allow you to move from page to page on the Web site, by remembering the information about the entire session. &nbsp; <br> <br>
Web beacons are transparent pixel images that are used in collecting information about Web site visitor activities and e-mail response and tracking. For example, if we send you an e-mail message, we (or third parties providing services on our behalf) may collect information through web beacons to determine whether you have opened the e-mail message or clicked on links located within the e-mail message.  &nbsp; <br> <br>
Information gathered through cookies, web beacons and by our web server logs may include your IP address, the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. This information is collected on an aggregate basis and is not associated with your profile. &nbsp; <br> <br>
We may use third-party advertising entities to serve ads when you visit our Web site. This company may use information about your visit to this Web site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. You may view, delete or block cookies by adjusting your web browser preferences.&nbsp; If you disable cookies, you may still use our Web site, but it may interfere with some of its functionality. &nbsp; <br> <strong><br>
How We Secure Information Transmissions</strong> &nbsp; <br>
We have implemented reasonable technical, physical, and administrative controls to help prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. For example, when we ask users to provide financial information (such as a credit card number), or any information during the registration or profile update process, the data is protected using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Individuals Located Outside the United States </strong>&nbsp; <br>
If you are located outside of the United States of America ("U.S."), please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the U.S.&nbsp; By joining PDR Network’s professional community, receiving our products or services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer. &nbsp; <br> <strong><br>
Mobile Devices/Third Party Fees</strong> &nbsp; <br>
PDR Network may deploy mobile marketing campaigns and may allow you to register for services that involve messages and/or e-mails being sent to your mobile device. You are responsible for obtaining access to the mobile device services and that access may involve third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime charges. You are solely responsible for those fees, including any and all fees associated with the delivery of the messages, e-mails or other materials to your mobile device. Please consult your mobile service provider's pricing plan prior to registering for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving messages or data from/to your mobile device. &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Transfers of Information for Legal Purposes &nbsp;</strong> <br>
PDR Network may need to disclose certain information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request. If there is a change of control in PDR Network’s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or a sale or transfer of its assets, customer information could be sold or transferred as part of that transaction and your information potentially used by the Purchaser or other recipient of said customer information, but any such use remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice. &nbsp; <br> <br>
You acknowledge that PDR Network is located in the U.S. and will process and store your information in the U.S., and that as a result, U.S. governments, courts or law enforcement, or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the U.S. &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Contact Us with Any Questions</strong> &nbsp; <br>
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of PDR Network Web sites, your dealings with PDR Network, or would like to provide comments, please contact us at customerservice@pdr.net, or by phone, toll-free, at 1-800-232-7379 within the United States. &nbsp; <br> <br>
