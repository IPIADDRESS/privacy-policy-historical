    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p><strong>Updated&nbsp;June 13, 2011</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you how PDR Network, LLC (“PDR Network”, “we” or “us”) secures and uses the personal information collected from individuals including healthcare professionals in connection with PDR Network’s products and services.&nbsp; In particular, the statement describes how PDR Network handles personal information collected via the <a href="http://www.pdr.net">www.pdr.net</a> Web site, other Web sites that link to this privacy statement, online registration, and offline PDR surveys, etc. By using this site or any of the PDR Network services, you indicate your acceptance of PDR Network’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Our Philosophy<br></strong></span><br>Your trust is our greatest asset. We make every reasonable effort to ensure that information held by PDR Network-powered Web sites is confidential and secure. We disclose our information-security practices to you as clearly and fully as possible. These practices receive continuous oversight, and many of our business decisions, including Web design, technology selections, and third-party business relationships, begin and end with considerations for your privacy.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Changes to Policy<br></span></strong><br>While our philosophy will not change, the details of the policy, including how we use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this privacy statement may change over time. If we make a material change to our policy, we will post and highlight the policy changes, and we will also notify you via e-mail or take other reasonable steps to give you an opportunity to opt-out of the new data uses.&nbsp; Please refer back to this page regularly. The date the policy was last revised will always appear at the top of the policy pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Site Ownership, Scope, and Applicability of the Policy</span></strong></p>
<p>This Policy applies only when you are within the PDR Network-branded environment and only to information that PDR Network collects.&nbsp; Please note that our Web sites may provide direct links to various sponsor and marketing partner sites.&nbsp; This privacy statement does not describe the practices of these parties.

<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Information that We Collect<br></span></strong><br>In general, you may visit this Web site without providing any personal information. The information we collect from Web site visitors is collected on an aggregate basis, and is not used to identify you in any way. </p>

<p>When you join the PDR Network professional community, we collect contact information (such as name, office address, office phone and fax numbers, and e-mail address), and other personal information (such as information about your professional background, licensure, practice, and areas of specialization as well as any other personal information that you choose to provide us). <br>We will tailor the materials we provide you based on the information in your profile, such as your specialty. Please note that certain products (such as the PDR® Book, FDA-approved PDR Drug Alerts,&nbsp; and sampling services) may only available to qualified, credentialed professionals, so you may not receive access to all of the services we offer if we cannot confirm your qualifications for them.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">When We Share Your Information with Others<br></span><br></strong>We work with business partners to provide the highest-quality services available. We may provide your information to third parties as needed to fulfill your requests for products and services or to facilitate the delivery of appropriate notices to you.&nbsp; For example, if you choose to participate in complimentary pharmaceutical product sampling programs, we will provide your information to the third party as required by the terms of the sampling program.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Special Note Regarding Protected Health Information You May Provide to PDR</span></strong></p>

Sections 164.501 and 160.103.&nbsp; PDR Network's policies and obligations to receive, store and/or communicate such PHI is governed by law and the agreement/terms of use found at <a href="https://rxevent.org/Tos.html">https://rxevent.org/Tos.html</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Your Choices<br></span></strong>We use good faith efforts to respect your preferences about our use and disclosure of your information.

<p>You can also tell us at any time after you register that you do not want us to disclose your information to unaffiliated third parties for their own use by updating your profile through the profile link on a PDR Network Web site homepage, or contacting our customer service department.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Accessing Your Information</span></strong></p>
<p>We strive to provide all our customers with reasonable opportunity to access and update their customer profile information.

<p>We may use third-party advertising entities to serve ads when you visit our Web site. This company may use information about your visit to this Web site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>How We Secure Information Transmissions</strong> </span></p>
<p>We have implemented reasonable technical, physical, and administrative controls to help prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.

<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Individuals Located Outside the United States<br></span></strong><br>If you are located outside of the United States of America ("U.S."), please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the U.S.&nbsp; By joining PDR Network’s professional community, receiving our products or services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Mobile Devices/Third Party Fees<br></span></strong><br>PDR Network may deploy mobile marketing campaigns and may allow you to register for services that involve messages and/or e-mails being sent to your mobile device. You are responsible for obtaining access to the mobile device services and that access may involve third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime charges.

<p>PDR Network may need to disclose certain information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request. If there is a change of control in PDR Network’s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or a sale or transfer of its assets, customer information could be sold or transferred as part of that transaction and your information potentially used by the Purchaser or other recipient of said customer information, but any such use remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice.</p>
