                  	A "cookie" is a small text file that a website 
                    can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for 
                    example, to collect information about your activities on the 
                    site or to make it possible for you to use an online "shopping 
                    cart" to keep track of items you wish to purchase. The cookie 
                    transmits this information back to the website's computer 
                    which, generally speaking, is the only computer that can read 
                    it.
