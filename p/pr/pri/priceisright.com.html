FremantleMedia North America, Inc. is part of the United States based operations of FremantleMedia Group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As set forth in FMNA Terms of Use, FMNA Services are general audience, are not targeted to children, and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you submit such information on the Site, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age and that you have the authority to register with the Site. IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 18, A PARENT/LEGAL GUARDIAN MUST SUPERVISE YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND REGISTRATION AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL YOUR CONDUCT ON THE SITE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use a FMNA Service without being registered with FMNA or subscribing to a FMNA Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to any FMNA Service. This Privacy Policy describes FMNA’s collection and use of users’ personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) where that information is not otherwise publicly available on FMNA Services. We also describe generally FMNA’s practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account. Your access to and use of certain FMNA Services may require you to accept additional terms and conditions or a privacy policy applicable to such FMNA Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us on or through FMNA Services (“<b>Unsolicited Submissions</b>“). Please see our Terms of Use for our policies regarding such Unsolicited Submissions. All such Unsolicited Submissions shall be deemed to be non-confidential, and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose and distribute such Unsolicited Submissions to others without limitation, attribution, or compensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON FMNA SERVICES</b><br>
<em>User Submitted Information</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <b>Registration Information</b> is the information that users must provide to FMNA at registration for a FMNA Service, for example, to receive a newsletter, enter a contest or sweepstakes, play a game or take a survey. Registration Information may include, for example, name, contact information, email address, zip code, birthday and other information you choose to provide us. If you register on a casting site we may request your contact information as well as resume information such as your previous employment or skills. As part of the registration process you may be asked to select a user name and password to be used to access your account and restricted areas of the site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <b>Public Information and Posts</b> consist of comments or content that you post to FMNA Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, such as a username and/or user picture. Public Information and Posts will always be public which means it will be available to everyone and will be displayed in search results both on FMNA Services and on external search engines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <b>Third Party Information and Content.</b> If you access a FMNA Service through a third party connection or log-in, your user submitted information may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that third party service, any information/content you have permitted the third party to share with FMNA, and any information you have made public in connection with that third party service (collectively, “Third Party Information and Content”). Third Party Information and Content obtained in this manner will be governed by this Privacy Policy, any applicable policy of the third party and the terms and conditions and/or terms of use for FMNA Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>FMNA Collected Information</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <b>Transactional and Site Activity Information</b>. When users access FMNA Services, we collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to FMNA Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access FMNA Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <b>Cookies and Similar Technologies</b>. We may also use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash technology), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. These technologies may be used to collect and store information about your usage of FMNA Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen. FMNA may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of FMNA Services to personal information obtained from you or from a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on FMNA Websites may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. FMNA may use persistent cookies that stay on your browser into the future until they expire or you delete them as well as session cookies that usually are erased when you close your browser window. Further general information about cookies and how they work is available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <b>Third Party Cookies and Similar Technologies.</b> Third parties that support FMNA Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as providing users with the ability to comment on content, allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics may also use cookies or similar technologies to collect similar information. We may allow selected third parties to place cookies through our site to provide us with better insights into the use of the site or user demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you. These third parties may collect information about a consumer’s online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our website. FMNA does not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of these third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g., <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en- US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies">http://windows.microsoft.com/en- US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies</a>). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html</a>. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through FMNA Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <b>Do not Track.</b> California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b)(as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how FMNA responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. FMNA does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <b>Third Parties.</b> To improve the quality of our services, FMNA may supplement the information we collect from you with information we obtain from third parties. If you access a FMNA Service through a third party connection or log-in, we may also collect Third Party Information and Content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <b>Collection of Payment Information by a Third Party.</b> FMNA uses independent third party service providers to manage sales of FMNA products or services. If you elect to purchase a product or service in connection with FMNA Services you will be required to provide our independent third party service provider with your payment information which may include your credit card information, billing address or other payment information, full name, phone number and shipping address (collectively, “Payment Information”) in order to purchase such product or service. You acknowledge and agree that FMNA does not receive your Payment Information, that this Privacy Policy will not apply to any Payment Information that you provide to any independent third party company on FMNA Services and that all payment obligations related to such purchase shall be governed solely by the applicable independent third party company’s privacy policy. You further acknowledge and agree that FMNA will have no liability for or control over such independent third party company’s use or protection of your Payment Information. You should check the privacy policy of the independent third party company‘s website to determine how it will handle any Payment Information it collects from you and/or processes. You acknowledge and agree that in the event that such independent third party company experiences a data breach that compromises or otherwise affects your Payment Information, FMNA shall in no way be responsible or liable to you for such breach. You should contact the applicable independent third party company regarding any such data breach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. NOTICE &amp; CHOICE</b><br>
• <b>Means of Notice and Choice.</b> This Privacy Policy is the primary means by which FMNA provides you with notice and choice about its collection and use of your personal information. FMNA will not use your personal information in a manner different from what is described in this Privacy Policy without your permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <b>Privacy Policy Changes.</b> FMNA may modify this Privacy Policy as necessary. We post the current effective date of this Privacy Policy above. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand our rights to use your personal information, we will notify you to seek your consent either through an email or a prominent posting on FMNA Websites. In the event the last email address you provided to FMNA is not valid or is not capable of delivering the notice to you, FMNA’s dispatch of an email containing the notice to that e-mail address shall nonetheless constitute effective notice. Please check back here from time to time to review any changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <b>Location of Data.</b> FMNA Services are hosted in the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information you provide transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States and other countries where data protection and other privacy laws may not offer the same level of protection as in your jurisdiction, such as in the European Union. This includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above. As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <b>Linked Services.</b> FMNA Services may also provide links to sites or services operated by FremantleMedia North America, Inc. affiliates (i.e., that are part of the FremantleMedia Group: “FMNA Affiliated Companies”) or by third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, rewards programs, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by third parties including, any online store. FMNA is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave FMNA Services via a link, enable a third party service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. Additionally, although all FMNA Affiliated Companies adhere to the FremantleMedia Group corporate Privacy Principles, users who visit a FMNA Affiliated Company site should still refer to its separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>5. SECURITY</b><br>
FMNA uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard user information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.

If we receive instructions using your log-in information we will consider that you have authorized the instructions.
