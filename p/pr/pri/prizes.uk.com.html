<strong>1.5. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</strong> Company currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to
associate certain Internet-related information about you with information about you in its database. Additionally, Company may use other new and
evolving sources of information in the future.
</p>
<p class="mainwindowcontent">
<strong>(a) Cookies.</strong> “Cookies” are a feature in your browser software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of
data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to
you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according
to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical
information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of
access to our Site. You can disable cookies, although the Site may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to
accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In
order to use all of the features and functionality of Company’s websites, you need to accept cookies.
</p>
<p class="mainwindowcontent">
<strong>(b) Web Beacons.</strong> A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to
transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database.
This allows Company to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to
determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Company also uses web beacons in email
messages sent to individuals listed in Company’s database.
</p>
<p class="mainwindowcontent">
<strong>(c) IP Addresses.</strong> Company automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We may use this
information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our
community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to
(whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique
Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users,
an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information
about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used
to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which
ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.
</p>
<p class="mainwindowcontent">
<strong>(d) Computer Profiles.</strong> Company may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze
the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, Company may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of
browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search
engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Identification Information, we are able to use such visitor data to
identify you.
</p>
<p class="mainwindowcontent">
<strong>(e) Data Analysis.</strong> Data Analysis technology may be employed from time to time if used by a Client of Company.
</p>
<p class="mainwindowcontent">
<strong>(f) New Technology.</strong> The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a
result, Company strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.
</p>
<p class="mainwindowcontent">
<strong>1.6. No Information Collected from Children.</strong> Company will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under
the age of 18. If Company obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 18, that information
will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such information, Company has no such information to use or to
disclose to third parties. Company has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
</p>
<p class="mainwindowcontent">
<strong>1.7. Credit Card Information.</strong> Company may, in certain instances, collect credit card numbers and related information when an
individual places an order from Company. When the credit card information is submitted to Company, such information is encrypted and is protected
with SSL encryption software. Company will use the credit card information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction,
and the credit card information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.
</p>
<p class="mainwindowcontent">
<strong>1.8 Security. </strong>When users submit information at the website or when our third-party marketing partners transfer your personal
information to us, such information is protected both online and offline. The servers in which we store the information are kept in a secure
physical environment. Currently, Company uses Secure Socket Layer Software ("SSL") to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts
information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses as they are transmitted over the Internet. Although we take reasonable
technological precautions to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, Company cannot
warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through our website is at your own risk.
