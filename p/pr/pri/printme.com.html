<h1>Electronics For Imaging, Inc.'s PrintMe Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. Electronics For Imaging, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively the "Company") has prepared this privacy notice ("Notice") to describe the type of information that the Company collects about you and how that information may be used and disclosed when you access or use any of the Company's products or services via the Internet or through any device or service that allows Internet access or uses the Internet to deliver products or services. This Notice is incorporated into the applicable terms of use (the "Terms of Use") of the Company's web site and/or individual product or service purchased or used by You. This Notice does not apply to any information or data that may be collected from you offline. The Company may revise or update this Notice from time to time, so you should refer back to this page often for the latest information.</p>

<p></p><div class="bold">WHAT IS "PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION"? </div><br>
"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that can be directly associated with a specific person such as a name, address, telephone number or e-mail address. If you are an individual user of the Service, your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address are Personally Identifiable Information. This Notice will govern how we treat your Personally Identifiable Information. <p></p>

<p>Whenever a business entity subscribes to our services or purchases a product and provides such services or product to its employees (e.g., if your company subscribes to the service or product on your behalf), this Notice generally will govern how we treat the employees' Personally Identifiable Information. However, we view the business entity as the subscriber or end-user and our service or product agreement with the business entity may require that we provide access to or disclose Personally Identifiable Information about an employee's use of the service such as service usage or location information. In that case, the subscriber company's own privacy policy will govern how it treats that information. If you are an employee of the subscriber or purchaser of the service or product, you should be aware that your employer has the right to access information about your usage of the service or product and any transactions you undertake through use of the service or product. </p>

<p></p><div class="bold">WHAT IS AGGREGATE INFORMATION? </div><br>
The Company's definition of Personally Identifiable Information does not include "Aggregate Information." Aggregate information is data the Company collects about a group of individuals or category of services or subscribers from which individual subscriber identities have been removed. Aggregate Information could include data on how you use the service or product. This information may be collected by the Company and combined with information about how others use the service or products, but no Personally Identifiable Information will be included in the resulting data. The Company uses Aggregate Information to help it understand demographic trends and user needs so that it can better serve your needs and the way in which you use the services or products. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">WHEN AND HOW IS INFORMATION COLLECTED? </div><br>
The Company collects information about you in a variety of ways: <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">Information You Give Us: </div> The Company collects information you give it when you sign up for, use, or request information about the Company's services or products or otherwise communicate with the Company through the Internet or any device that allows Internet access. Such information may include your contact information as well as your billing address and credit card information when you sign up for services or purchase a product. When you sign up or register for such products or services, the Company may advise you of your options regarding the type of information that is collected, how it is used, and the manner in which you would like the Company to communicate with you. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">Automatically Collected Information: </div> The Company automatically receives certain types of information whenever you interact with the Company or use its products or services. For example, the Company obtains certain types of information when your Web browser accesses the Company's web site, including your IP address and the type of browser you use. The Company also receives similar information when you use products or services that require that a mobile or other device access the Company's computer systems. <p></p>


<p></p><div class="bold">Information from Other Sources: </div> The Company may receive information about you from other sources, such as credit and/or credit card information from third party sources before initiating service. We may also buy marketing information from others to help us better inform you about new products or services that we think will interest you. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">Cookies: </div> Cookies are text files that are placed on your hard drive by a web site when you visit that web site. Cookies identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your visit to that site so that when you return to the site, the site knows who you are and can personalize your visit. Cookies also enable a Web site shopping cart to function so that you only have to check out once. The Company may use cookies in general to collect information to determine how to improve our sites by seeing which areas, features and products are most popular; to personalize the site and make recommendations based on products you have liked in the past as well as to improve the site experience; and to complete transactions you have requested. Advertisers that serve ads on our Web sites may also use their own cookies. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">Web Beacons: </div> Web beacons, also called single-pixel gifs, are electronic images that are placed on web pages or in an email message. These web beacons are designed to monitor who is reading a web page or email message. They are often invisible to the user because they are typically very small. Web beacons are not used to access your Personally Identifiable Information. They are only used to compile aggregate statistics about usage. Some sites accessible through the Company web site or through use of its products or services may contain web beacons be placed there by the Company's advertisers or third party service providers to collect the same type of aggregate information. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">HOW DOES THE COMPANY USE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION? </div><br>
The Company uses Personally Identifiable Information for billing purposes, to market and provide services, to resolve problems with your product or service, and to create and inform you of products or services that better meet your needs. This information allows the Company to understand how you use the Company's web site, product or services and in some cases enables the Company to customize and personalize your experience. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">HOW WILL PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION BE DISCLOSED? </div><br>
The Company does not sell Personally Identifiable Information to others and we disclose Personally Identifiable Information only in the following ways: <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">With Your Consent </div><br>
The Company may request your consent to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information in a number ways: in writing, online by clicking a button, verbally, in person or over the telephone, or at the time of initiation or use of any service when your consent is part of the required terms and conditions to use a service or product. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">To Complete Your Service Requests or Transactions </div><br>
The Company discloses Personally Identifiable Information to third parties as necessary to complete a transaction or perform a service on your behalf, for example, charging your credit card for product or service purchased. When the Company does disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for such a purpose, that third party will not be permitted to disclose Personally Identifiable Information to another third party without your consent. <p></p>

<p>The Company's services may let you take advantage of services and products offered by other companies, either by electing to receive information about those services and products or by directing you to third party web sites. In those cases, information about you received by those third parties will be governed by their privacy policies. For example, when you purchase a product or service from a merchant through the Company's web site or through a wireless service, you may provide Personally Identifiable Information to that entity and some information may automatically be passed to the site as well, such as your source IP address or other device identifier. Whenever you use the products or services of third parties, their privacy policies will control their use of your information. </p>

<p></p><div class="bold">For Your Protection and the Protection of the Company and Others </div><br>
The Company will release Personally Identifiable Information and other account information when the Company believes it is necessary or appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce the Company's end user terms or customer agreements, to initiate, render, bill, and collect for products or services, to protect the Company's rights or property, or to protect other users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Company's products or services; or if the Company reasonably believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of such records. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">WHAT ABOUT LOCATION-BASED SERVICES AND INFORMATION? </div><br>
If your product or service incorporates or consists of a mobile device, the Company's network generally knows its "location." This location capability makes wireless communications possible and enables the Company to properly bill for services. <p></p>

<p>Currently, the Company discloses location information to third parties when required to do so to provide services, or in emergency situations to provide such information to emergency medical services providers, fire or law enforcement officials. The law also permits the Company to disclose location information without consent to inform a user's legal guardian or members of a user's immediate family of the user's location in an emergency situation, or to providers or managers of information in order to assist in the delivery of emergency services, or to government agencies if the Company reasonably believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury justifies disclosure without delay. </p>

<p></p><div class="bold">WHAT ABOUT USE IN ON-LINE SHOPPING? </div><br>
Through some of the Company's products and service, you may be able to purchase products or services or register to receive materials such as newsletters, catalogs and new product and service updates. In many cases you will be asked to provide contact information and possibly credit card information. If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order to be sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about that recipient. You should be aware that the Company has no control over third parties' use of any information you provide to such a third party when placing an order. Please exercise caution when doing so. If you order products or service directly from the Company, your Personally Identifiable Information will be subject to this Notice and the Company will only use your Personally Identifiable Information to process such order and in the other ways described in this Notice. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">WHAT ABOUT VOLUNTARY CUSTOMER SURVEYS? </div><br>
The Company may periodically conduct customer surveys. We encourage you to participate in these surveys because they provide us and our partners and affiliates with important information that helps us improve the types of services and product we offer. We take the information we receive from an individual completing a customer survey and combine it with information we receive from other individuals to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions. We consider the resulting information to be aggregate information that may be shared with third parties. This aggregate information will not contain Personally Identifiable Information. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">WHAT KIND OF SECURITY DOES THE COMPANY USE FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION? </div><br>
The Company maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards for information collected through the use of its Web site that is consistent with industry standards and applicable federal regulations. However, you should be aware that the Company has no control over the security of other sites that you visit on the Internet, or from which you buy products or services. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">WHAT ABOUT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS ON OR WITH THE COMPANY'S WEB SITE OR SERVICES? </div><br>
Except as stated in this Notice with respect to Personally Identifiable Information, or the Terms of Use for the applicable product or service, transmissions and other voluntary submissions of your information to and from the Company's web site or through the use of other services are not confidential, and you should be aware that your transmissions may be read or intercepted by others. These transmissions may include emails, posting to public bulletin boards or chat rooms, and submissions or contributions of text or scanned images. You acknowledge that except as stated in this Notice, the applicable Terms of Use, and any other policies posted or provided to you by the Company, there is no confidential, fiduciary or contractual relationship, either implied or explicit, created between you and the Company with respect to these submissions. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">WHAT ABOUT INFORMATION PROVIDED IN PUBLIC FORUMS? </div><br>
Any information that is disclosed in public areas of the Company web site or public areas offered through any of the Company's products or services will become public information. The Company cannot control the use of information disclosed in Public Forums, such as bulletin boards and chat rooms. You should exercise caution when disclosing information in these public areas and should refrain from disclosing Personally Identifiable Information. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">HOW CAN A USER HELP TO PROTECT HIS OR HER PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION? </div><br>
An important part of protecting the security of Personally Identifiable Information is your efforts to protect against unauthorized access to your product or service, wireless device, user name and password, and computer. You should not share your user information, identification and password with others. You should also make certain to sign off your computer and/or any product or service when you are finished. Always make certain to log out of any site when you are finished viewing personal account information. <p></p>

<p>Except as stated in this Notice and in the applicable Terms of Use, the Company makes no representations or warranties about the security of any wireless or web services or that your use will be error-free, uninterrupted, or free of infection by viruses or other malicious codes or acts of third parties. </p>

<p></p><div class="bold">HOW DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO CHILDREN? </div><br>
The Company recognizes that parents may purchase products and services for family use, including for use by minors. Any information collected from such usage will appear to be that of the subscriber (the parent) and be treated as such under this Notice. Further, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and this Notice, the Company does not design or intend for its products or services to collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If the Company's policies change in that regard, it will obtain verifiable parental consent before any collection, use or disclosure of such information. However, if a child under 13 uses a service or product with or without your permission to access a site on the Internet, that site's privacy policy will govern that child's use of the site, including treatment of information your child provides to that site. Such use of information is outside the control of the Company, but we encourage you to be involved in the online activities of your children to ensure that no information is collected from a child under 13 without parental permission. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">HOW CAN YOU CHECK ACCOUNT INFORMATION OR CHANGE YOUR PROFILE? </div><br>
If you are registered, you may change your password, and certain other information by logging into your account at www.printme.com. You may also contact a service representative for assistance. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">WHAT ABOUT DISPUTES? </div><br>
Any dispute over this Notice or its application to you is subject the terms of the applicable Terms of Use. <p></p>

<p></p><div class="bold">WILL THIS NOTICE BE CHANGED IN THE FUTURE? </div><br>
The Company may update this Notice in the future for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, changes in the products or service offering, changes in the technology or the way services are provided or due to the introduction of new services. The Company may also update this Notice and/or change the way Personally Identifiable Information and/or other information is collected and used due to changes in state and federal regulations. You should refer back to this page often for the latest information. <p></p>
