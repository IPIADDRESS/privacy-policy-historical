      <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
        information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior service, 
        our most important asset is our client's trust. Keeping confidential client 
        information secure, and using it only as our clients would want us to, 
        is a top priority for all of us at Primerica and its sister companies 
        in Citigroup Inc. Here, then, is our Promise to our individual clients: 
        We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, 
        any information our clients share with us. We will limit the collection 
        and use of client information to the minimum we require to deliver superior 
        service to our clients, which includes advising our clients about our 
        products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business. 
        We will permit only authorized Primerica employees, who are trained in 
        the proper handling of client information, to have access to that information. 
        Employees who violate our Privacy Promise will be subject to our normal 
        disciplinary process. We will not reveal client information to any external 
        organization unless we have previously informed the client in disclosures 
        or agreements, been authorized by the client or are required by law. We 
        will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our client information. 
        We will, however, facilitate relevant offers from reputable companies. 
        These companies are not permitted to retain any client information unless 
        the client has specifically expressed an interest in their products or 
        services. We will tell clients in plain language, initially and at least 
        once annually, how they may remove their names from marketing lists. At 
        any time, clients may contact us to remove their names from marketing 
        lists. Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, 
        we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow 
        us to audit them for compliance. For purposes of credit reporting, verification 
        and risk management, we will exchange information about our clients only 
        with reputable reference sources and clearinghouse services. We will not 
        share – internally or externally – personally identifiable medical 
        information for any purpose other than the underwriting or administration 
        of a client's policy, claim or account, or as disclosed to the client 
        when the information is collected, or to which the client consents. We 
        will attempt to keep client files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. 
        We will tell our clients how and where to access conveniently their information 
        (except when we're prohibited by law) and how to notify us about errors, 
        which we will promptly correct. We will continuously assess ourselves 
        to ensure that client privacy is respected. We will conduct our business 
        in a manner that fulfills our Promise to you, our client.</font></p>
