        made privacy a priority since we began doing business. In fact, in addition 
        to legal requirements, we’ve long observed our own high standards

        service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about 
        our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our

        Privacy Promise for Customers</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">While information 
        is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior service, our most 
        important asset is our customer's trust. Keeping customer information 
        secure, and using it only as our customers would want us to, is a top 
        priority for all of us at Citigroup. Here, then, is our Promise to our 
        individual customers:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">1. We will safeguard, 
        according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information 
        our customers share with us.<br>
        <br>
        2. We will limit the collection and use of customer information to the 
        minimum we require to deliver superior service to our customers, which 
        includes advising our customers about our products, services and other 
        opportunities, and to administer our business.<br>
        <br>
        3. We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper 
        handling of customer information, to have access to that information. 
        Employees who violate our Privacy Promise will be subject to our normal 
        disciplinary process.<br>
        <br>
        4. We will not reveal customer information to any external organization 
        unless we have previously informed the customer in disclosures or agreements, 
        have been authorized by the customer or are required by law.<br>
        <br>
        5. We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our customer 
        information. We may, however, facilitate relevant offers from reputable 
        companies. These companies are not permitted to retain any customer information 
        unless the customer has specifically expressed interest in their products 
        or services.<br>
        <br>
        6. We will tell customers in plain language, initially and at least once 
        annually, how they may remove their names from marketing lists. At any 
        time, customers can contact us to remove their names from such lists.<br>
        <br>
        7. Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we 
        will require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow us 
        to audit them for compliance.<br>
        <br>
        8. For purposes of credit reporting, verification and risk management, 
        we will exchange information about our customers with reputable reference 
        sources and clearinghouse services.<br>
        <br>
        9. We will not use or share — internally or externally — personally 
        identifiable medical information for any purpose other than the underwriting 
        or administration of a customer’s policy, claim or account, or as 
        disclosed to the customer when the information is collected, or to which 
        the customer consents.<br>
        <br>
        10. We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up to date, and accurate. 
        We will tell our customers how and where to conveniently access their 
        information (except when we’re prohibited by law) and how to notify 
        us about errors, which we will promptly correct.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We will continuously 
        assess ourselves to ensure that customer privacy is respected. We will
