Such retrieval never happens without explicit consent from you as a user.</p><h2>Who could we end up sharing your personal data with?</h2><h3>Data processors</h3><p>In cases where it is necessary so that we can provide our services, we share your personal data with companies that are so-called data processors for us. A data processor is a company that processes the data on our behalf and according to our instructions. We have data processors who help us with:</p><ol><li>Payment solutions (card issuing companies, banks and other payment service providers). </li><li>Marketing (print and distribution, social media, media agencies or advertising agencies). </li><li>IT services (companies that handle necessary operative solutions, technical support and maintenance of our IT solutions) </li><li>Billing in cases where a retailer has Swedish social security number as corporate ID number (one-person company). </li><li>Aggregation, anonymisation and sale of behavioural data.</li></ol><p>When your personal data is shared with personal data counsels, it is for purposes that are compatible with the purposes for which we have collected the data (e.g. to meet our obligations according to purchase or membership terms). We check all personal data counsels to ensure that they can provide sufficient safeguards regarding the security and confidentiality of personal data. </p><p>We have written agreements with all personal data counsels through which they guarantee the security of the personal data processed and undertake to comply with our security requirements as well as restrictions and requirements regarding the international transfer of personal data.</p><h3>Companies which are independently responsible for personal data</h3><p>We also share your personal data with certain companies that are independently responsible for personal data. The fact that the company is independently responsible for personal data means that we are not the party controlling how the data submitted to the company will be processed. Companies and other parties who are independently responsible for personal data and with whom we share your personal data with are:</p><ol><li>Government agencies (police, tax agencies or other authorities) if we are required to do so by law or upon the suspicion of crime. </li><li>Companies offering payment solutions (card issuing companies, banks and other payment service providers). </li></ol><p>When your personal data is shared with a company that is independently responsible for personal data, the privacy policy and personal data management of that company takes precedence and is that which applies.</p><h2>Where do we process your personal data?</h2><p>We always strive to ensure that your personal data is processed within the EU/EEA and that all of our own IT systems are located within the EU/EEA. However, upon systematic support and maintenance, we may have to transfer the data to a country outside the EU/EEA. If we share your personal data with a personal data counsel who - either on their own or through a subcontractor - is established or stores data in a country outside the EU/EEA, in these cases the counsel may only share the data relevant to the purpose (e.g. log files).</p><p>Regardless of the country in which your personal data is processed, we take all reasonable legal, technical and organisational measures to ensure that the level of protection is the same as within the EU/EEA. In cases where personal data is processed outside of the EU/EEA, the level of protection is guaranteed either by a decision by the EU Commission that the country concerned ensures an adequate level of protection or by the use of so-called appropriate safeguards. Examples of appropriate safeguards are approved codes of conduct in the recipient country, standard contract clauses, binding company internal rules or Privacy Shield. </p><p>If you want a copy of the safeguards that have been taken or information about where these have been made available, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@pricerunner.com">privacy@pricerunner.com</a>.</p><h2>How long do we storage your personal data?</h2><p>We never storage your personal data longer than is necessary for each purpose. See more about the special storage periods for each purpose.</p><h2>What rights do you have as someone who is a registered member?</h2><h3>Right to access (so-called register extract)</h3><p>We are always open and transparent about how we process your personal data and if you want to gain a deeper insight into the personal data we are processing, you may request access to the data (the data is provided in the form of a register extract indicating purpose, categories of personal data, categories of recipients, storage periods, information about where the information has been collected and the existence of any automated decision-making).</p><p>Please note that if we receive a request for access, we may ask for additional information to ensure the effective handling of your request and that the information is provided to the correct person.</p><h3>Right to rectification</h3><p>You may request that your personal information be corrected if the information is incorrect. Within the framework of the stated purpose, you also have the right to supplement any incomplete personal data.</p><p>Keep in mind that you as a member of PriceRunner can edit a great deal of submitted data when logged in on PriceRunner's website.</p><h3>Right to deletion</h3><p>You may request the deletion of personal data we process about you if:</p><ul><li>The data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which they have been collected or processed.</li><li>You oppose a weighing of interests we have performed based on legitimate interest and your objection weighs more than our legitimate interest.</li><li>You oppose processing for direct marketing purposes.</li><li>Personal data is processed illegally.</li><li>Personal data must be erased to comply with a legal obligation we are subject to.</li><li>Personal data which has been collected for a child (under the age of 13) for which you have parental responsibility and collection has been made in connection with an offering via information society services (e.g. social media).</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that we may have the right to deny your request if there are legal obligations that prevent us from immediately deleting certain personal data. These obligations derive from accounting and tax legislation, banking and money laundering legislation, yet also from consumer law. </p><p>It may also be possible that processing is necessary for us to determine, enforce or defend legal claims. Should we be prevented from granting a request for deletion, we will instead block personal data from being used for purposes other than the purpose that prevents the requested deletion.</p><h3>Right to limitation</h3><p>You have the right to request that our processing of your personal data be limited. If you disagree that the personal data we process is correct, you may request limited processing during the time which we need to check if your personal data is correct or not. If we no longer need your personal data for the stated purposes, but you need the data to determine, enforce or defend legal claims, you may request limited processing of the data by us. This means that you can request that we do not delete your data.</p><p>If you have objected to a weighing of interest of legitimate interest that we have performed as a legal basis for a purpose, you may request limited processing during the time which we need in order to check if our legitimate interest outweighs your interest in having the data deleted.</p><p>If the processing has been limited in accordance with any of the above situations, we may, in addition to the actual storage, process the data to determine, enforce or defend legal claims, to protect someone else's rights or if you have given your consent.</p><h3>Right to object to certain types of processing</h3><p>You always have the right to avoid direct marketing and to object to all processing of personal data based on a weighing of interest.</p><h3>Legitimate interest</h3><p>In cases where we use a weighing of interest as a legal basis for a purpose, you have the possibility to object to the processing. In order to continue processing your personal data after such objection, we need to demonstrate a compelling legitimate reason for the current processing that weighs heavier than your interests, rights or freedoms. Otherwise, we may only process the data to determine, exercise or defend legal claims.</p><h3>Direct marketing (including analyses performed for direct marketing purposes)</h3><p>You may object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing. The objection also includes the analyses of personal data (so-called profiling) performed for direct marketing purposes. Direct marketing refers to all types of targeted marketing actions (e.g. e-mail and text messaging). </p><p>Marketing actions - where you as a customer have actively chosen to use one of our services or otherwise initiated contact with us to know more about our services - do not count as direct marketing (such as product recommendations or other features and offers on PriceRunner's website).</p><p>If you oppose direct marketing, we will discontinue the processing of your personal data for that purpose and terminate any direct marketing actions.</p><p>Keep in mind that you are always able to influence which channels we will use for communicating personal offers. E.g. you can choose to receive only e-mails from us, but not text messages. In this case, you should not object to personal data processing as such but limit our communication channels (by changing the settings on ‘My pages’or by contacting customer service).</p><h3>Right to data portability</h3><p>If our right to process your personal data is based either on your consent or implementation of an agreement with you, you are entitled to request that the data relating to you and which you have provided to us is transferred to another party which will be responsible for the personal data (so-called data portability). A prerequisite for data portability is that the transfer is technically possible and can occur in an automated manner.</p><h2>Does PriceRunner process social security numbers?</h2><p>PriceRunner never processes social security numbers, unless it is absolutely necessary for a retailer to complete a transaction on PriceRunner's website. We will only process your social security number when it is clearly motivated by the purpose, necessary for secure identification or if there is any other prominent reason. We will always minimise the use of your social security number by using, to as great an extent possible, your date of birth numbers instead.</p><h2>What are cookies and how do we use them?</h2><p>Cookies are a small texts consisting of letters and numbers sent from our web server and stored on your browser or device. </p><p>On pricerunner.com, we use the following cookies:
1. Session cookies (a temporary cookie that terminates when you close your browser or device).

Your browser or device allows you to change the settings for the usage and scope of cookies. Go to the settings of your browser or device to learn more about managing the settings for cookies. Examples of things you can manage are blocking all cookies, only accepting first party cookies, or deleting cookies when you close your browser. </p><p>Keep in mind that some of our services might not work if you block or delete cookies. You can read more about cookies in general on youronlinechoices.eu.</p><h2>How is your personal data protected?</h2><p>We use IT systems to protect the privacy, integrity and access to personal data. We have adopted security measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised or illegal processing (such as unauthorised access, loss, destruction or damage). Only those persons who actually need to process your personal data to meet our stated purposes have access to them.</p><h2>What does it mean that the Data Protection Authority is the supervisory authority?</h2><p>The Data Protection Authority is responsible for monitoring the application of the law, and a person who deems that a company processes personal data in an incorrect manner is able to file a complaint through the Data Protection Authority.</p><h2>How do you contact us in the easiest manner with questions about data protection?</h2><p>Since we take data protection very seriously, we have designated employees who handle these issues, and you can always reach them via <a href="mailto:privacy@pricerunner.com">privacy@pricerunner.com</a>.</p><p>We may make changes to our privacy policy. The latest version of the privacy policy is always available here on the website. Upon updates that are critical to our processing of personal data (such as a change in specified purposes or categories of personal data) or updates that are not critical to processing but which may be of crucial importance to you, you will receive information via pricerunner.com and via e-mail (if you have stated an e-mail address) in good time before the updates start to apply. </p><p>When we provide information about updates, we will also explain what the updates involve and how they affect you.</p><p><em>The Privacy Policy was last updated 21-05-2018</em></p></div></div></div><div

That's a great question. It all comes down to our vision of making it easier for you to make great purchases online, for example during Black Friday. \n\nA great deal can be finding the right product at the right time and price, getting your order with same-day delivery options, or finding that special something with just the right product specs for your needs.\n\nThis is where discount codes come in. Like other kinds of deals or promotions (such as Black Friday), discount codes have become a mainstay of what many customers expect when shopping online. Our ambition is to be a helping hand in pointing you towards the best deals.\n\nA main priority for us is ensuring the eligibility and validity of the codes; they must work and deliver on what they promise. We are happy to receive any feedback you have which can help us improve on our mission.\n\nWe aim to keep you up to date with the latest and greatest discount codes from your favourite stores.

Such retrieval never happens without explicit consent from you as a user.\n\n## Who could we end up sharing your personal data with?\n### Data processors\nIn cases where it is necessary so that we can provide our services, we share your personal data with companies that are so-called data processors for us. A data processor is a company that processes the data on our behalf and according to our instructions. We have data processors who help us with:\n\n1. Payment solutions (card issuing companies, banks and other payment service providers). \n2. Marketing (print and distribution, social media, media agencies or advertising agencies). \n3. IT services (companies that handle necessary operative solutions, technical support and maintenance of our IT solutions) \n4. Billing in cases where a retailer has Swedish social security number as corporate ID number (one-person company). \n5. Aggregation, anonymisation and sale of behavioural data.\n\nWhen your personal data is shared with personal data counsels, it is for purposes that are compatible with the purposes for which we have collected the data (e.g. to meet our obligations according to purchase or membership terms). We check all personal data counsels to ensure that they can provide sufficient safeguards regarding the security and confidentiality of personal data. \n\nWe have written agreements with all personal data counsels through which they guarantee the security of the personal data processed and undertake to comply with our security requirements as well as restrictions and requirements regarding the international transfer of personal data.\n\n### Companies which are independently responsible for personal data\nWe also share your personal data with certain companies that are independently responsible for personal data. The fact that the company is independently responsible for personal data means that we are not the party controlling how the data submitted to the company will be processed. Companies and other parties who are independently responsible for personal data and with whom we share your personal data with are:\n\n1. Government agencies (police, tax agencies or other authorities) if we are required to do so by law or upon the suspicion of crime. \n2. Companies offering payment solutions (card issuing companies, banks and other payment service providers). \n\nWhen your personal data is shared with a company that is independently responsible for personal data, the privacy policy and personal data management of that company takes precedence and is that which applies.\n\n## Where do we process your personal data?\nWe always strive to ensure that your personal data is processed within the EU\u002FEEA and that all of our own IT systems are located within the EU\u002FEEA. However, upon systematic support and maintenance, we may have to transfer the data to a country outside the EU\u002FEEA. If we share your personal data with a personal data counsel who - either on their own or through a subcontractor - is established or stores data in a country outside the EU\u002FEEA, in these cases the counsel may only share the data relevant to the purpose (e.g. log files).\n\nRegardless of the country in which your personal data is processed, we take all reasonable legal, technical and organisational measures to ensure that the level of protection is the same as within the EU\u002FEEA. In cases where personal data is processed outside of the EU\u002FEEA, the level of protection is guaranteed either by a decision by the EU Commission that the country concerned ensures an adequate level of protection or by the use of so-called appropriate safeguards. Examples of appropriate safeguards are approved codes of conduct in the recipient country, standard contract clauses, binding company internal rules or Privacy Shield. \n\nIf you want a copy of the safeguards that have been taken or information about where these have been made available, please contact us at [privacy@pricerunner.com](mailto:privacy@pricerunner.com).\n\n## How long do we storage your personal data?\nWe never storage your personal data longer than is necessary for each purpose. See more about the special storage periods for each purpose.\n\n## What rights do you have as someone who is a registered member?\n### Right to access (so-called register extract)\nWe are always open and transparent about how we process your personal data and if you want to gain a deeper insight into the personal data we are processing, you may request access to the data (the data is provided in the form of a register extract indicating purpose, categories of personal data, categories of recipients, storage periods, information about where the information has been collected and the existence of any automated decision-making).\n\nPlease note that if we receive a request for access, we may ask for additional information to ensure the effective handling of your request and that the information is provided to the correct person.\n\n### Right to rectification \nYou may request that your personal information be corrected if the information is incorrect. Within the framework of the stated purpose, you also have the right to supplement any incomplete personal data.\n\nKeep in mind that you as a member of PriceRunner can edit a great deal of submitted data when logged in on PriceRunner's website.\n\n### Right to deletion \nYou may request the deletion of personal data we process about you if:\n*  The data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which they have been collected or processed.\n*  You oppose a weighing of interests we have performed based on legitimate interest and your objection weighs more than our legitimate interest.\n*  You oppose processing for direct marketing purposes.\n*  Personal data is processed illegally.\n*  Personal data must be erased to comply with a legal obligation we are subject to.\n*  Personal data which has been collected for a child (under the age of 13) for which you have parental responsibility and collection has been made in connection with an offering via information society services (e.g. social media).\n\nKeep in mind that we may have the right to deny your request if there are legal obligations that prevent us from immediately deleting certain personal data. These obligations derive from accounting and tax legislation, banking and money laundering legislation, yet also from consumer law. \n\nIt may also be possible that processing is necessary for us to determine, enforce or defend legal claims. Should we be prevented from granting a request for deletion, we will instead block personal data from being used for purposes other than the purpose that prevents the requested deletion.\n\n### Right to limitation \nYou have the right to request that our processing of your personal data be limited. If you disagree that the personal data we process is correct, you may request limited processing during the time which we need to check if your personal data is correct or not. If we no longer need your personal data for the stated purposes, but you need the data to determine, enforce or defend legal claims, you may request limited processing of the data by us. This means that you can request that we do not delete your data.\n\nIf you have objected to a weighing of interest of legitimate interest that we have performed as a legal basis for a purpose, you may request limited processing during the time which we need in order to check if our legitimate interest outweighs your interest in having the data deleted.\n\nIf the processing has been limited in accordance with any of the above situations, we may, in addition to the actual storage, process the data to determine, enforce or defend legal claims, to protect someone else's rights or if you have given your consent.\n\n### Right to object to certain types of processing\nYou always have the right to avoid direct marketing and to object to all processing of personal data based on a weighing of interest.\n\n### Legitimate interest\nIn cases where we use a weighing of interest as a legal basis for a purpose, you have the possibility to object to the processing. In order to continue processing your personal data after such objection, we need to demonstrate a compelling legitimate reason for the current processing that weighs heavier than your interests, rights or freedoms. Otherwise, we may only process the data to determine, exercise or defend legal claims.\n\n### Direct marketing (including analyses performed for direct marketing purposes) \nYou may object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing. The objection also includes the analyses of personal data (so-called profiling) performed for direct marketing purposes. Direct marketing refers to all types of targeted marketing actions (e.g. e-mail and text messaging). \n\nMarketing actions - where you as a customer have actively chosen to use one of our services or otherwise initiated contact with us to know more about our services - do not count as direct marketing (such as product recommendations or other features and offers on PriceRunner's website).\n\nIf you oppose direct marketing, we will discontinue the processing of your personal data for that purpose and terminate any direct marketing actions.\n\nKeep in mind that you are always able to influence which channels we will use for communicating personal offers. E.g. you can choose to receive only e-mails from us, but not text messages. In this case, you should not object to personal data processing as such but limit our communication channels (by changing the settings on ‘My pages’or by contacting customer service).\n\n### Right to data portability\nIf our right to process your personal data is based either on your consent or implementation of an agreement with you, you are entitled to request that the data relating to you and which you have provided to us is transferred to another party which will be responsible for the personal data (so-called data portability). A prerequisite for data portability is that the transfer is technically possible and can occur in an automated manner.\n\n## Does PriceRunner process social security numbers?\nPriceRunner never processes social security numbers, unless it is absolutely necessary for a retailer to complete a transaction on PriceRunner's website. We will only process your social security number when it is clearly motivated by the purpose, necessary for secure identification or if there is any other prominent reason. We will always minimise the use of your social security number by using, to as great an extent possible, your date of birth numbers instead.\n\n## What are cookies and how do we use them?\nCookies are a small texts consisting of letters and numbers sent from our web server and stored on your browser or device. \n\nOn pricerunner.com, we use the following cookies:\n1. Session cookies (a temporary cookie that terminates when you close your browser or device). \n2. Sustained cookies (cookies that remain on your computer until you delete them or they expire). \n3. First party cookies (cookies set by the website you visit). \n4. Third party cookies (cookies set by a third party site).\n5. Similar technologies (technologies that store information in your browser or device in a manner similar to cookies).\n\nThe cookies we use are intended to improve the services we offer. Some of our services need cookies to work properly, while others improve the services for you. We use cookies for overall analytical information regarding your use of our services and for saving functional settings such as language and other information. We also use cookies to provide relevant targeted marketing to you.\n\nYou can read more about our use of cookies in our [Cookie Policy](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pricerunner.com\u002Finfo\u002Fcookies). You can always contact us for more specific information, or if you have questions about our cookies, by e-mailing [privacy@pricerunner.com](mailto:privacy@pricerunner.com).\n\n## Can you yourself control the use of cookies?\nYes. Your browser or device allows you to change the settings for the usage and scope of cookies. Go to the settings of your browser or device to learn more about managing the settings for cookies. Examples of things you can manage are blocking all cookies, only accepting first party cookies, or deleting cookies when you close your browser. \n\nKeep in mind that some of our services might not work if you block or delete cookies. You can read more about cookies in general on youronlinechoices.eu.\n\n## How is your personal data protected?\nWe use IT systems to protect the privacy, integrity and access to personal data. We have adopted security measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised or illegal processing (such as unauthorised access, loss, destruction or damage). Only those persons who actually need to process your personal data to meet our stated purposes have access to them.\n\n## What does it mean that the Data Protection Authority is the supervisory authority?\nThe Data Protection Authority is responsible for monitoring the application of the law, and a person who deems that a company processes personal data in an incorrect manner is able to file a complaint through the Data Protection Authority.\n\n## How do you contact us in the easiest manner with questions about data protection?\nSince we take data protection very seriously, we have designated employees who handle these issues, and you can always reach them via [privacy@pricerunner.com](mailto:privacy@pricerunner.com).\n\nWe may make changes to our privacy policy. The latest version of the privacy policy is always available here on the website. Upon updates that are critical to our processing of personal data (such as a change in specified purposes or categories of personal data) or updates that are not critical to processing but which may be of crucial importance to you, you will receive information via pricerunner.com and via e-mail (if you have stated an e-mail address) in good time before the updates start to apply. \n\nWhen we provide information about updates, we will also explain what the updates involve and how they affect you.\n\n*The Privacy Policy was last updated 21-05-2018*","metaTitle":"PriceRunner Privacy
