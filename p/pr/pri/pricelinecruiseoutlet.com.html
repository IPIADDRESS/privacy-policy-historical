<h2>Sharing Your Personal Data</h2>
<p>Priceline.com does not share your Personal Data, except as disclosed in this statement. Priceline.com may share your Personal Data with its subsidiaries and with third parties as described in the categories below:</p>
<p><u>Certain Services</u>: In order to provide you with certain services, we may share your Personal Data with our third party partners, or require that you transact directly with a third party partner. Third party partners consist of companies with which priceline.com has contracted in order to provide you with services or products featured on our Site.  Below is a list of some of such services:</p>
<p><em>Priceline Cruises</em>. Priceline Cruises are offered through National Leisure Group, LLC ("NLG"). When you provide Personal Data in connection with the purchase or booking of a cruise, you are providing such Personal Data to NLG, which holds such Personal Data on our behalf.

<p>
<u>Priceline.com's Agents</u>: Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with these tasks. For example, priceline.com hires companies to help us handle mail and e-mail (including sending and delivering packages, postal mail and e-mail) analyze the data we collect, market our products and services, handle credit card transactions and provide customer service. The companies we employ to help us with these tasks have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

<p><u>External Service Providers</u>: When you use the priceline.com service to purchase an airline ticket, reserve a hotel room or a rental car or to take advantage of any of our other products and services (including travel insurance), we provide Personal Data to the airline, hotel, car rental agency, travel agency or other involved third-party.</p>
