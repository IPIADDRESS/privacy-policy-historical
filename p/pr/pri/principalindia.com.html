          <p><strong>Information on Our Website Security</strong><br>
            The information for the accounts  you have with Principal is kept secure and confidential through multiple  security features and procedures. We  use a variety of security technologies and procedures as specified under the  Privacy Rules to help protect your Information including Personal Information  and Sensitive Personal Data or Information from unauthorized access, usage and  disclosure, such as encryption, passwords, physical security etc. by <em>inter-alia</em> the following: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The  information you request from our Website for your accounts can only be accessed  with your password. It is your responsibility to keep your password  confidential. </li>
            <li>Do not  disclose your password to anyone. Our employees and associates will never ask  you for your password. If a  password is used to help protect your accounts and information, you are  responsible for keeping your password confidential.&nbsp; </li>
            <li>Never  write your password on something others may see. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out  before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from  subsequent users. </li>
            <li>Change  your password immediately by accessing our Website using your login ID, if you  suspect someone has discovered it. </li>
            <li>Information  you submit through our Website, as well as the information we send back to you  while you are visiting our Website, is protected while passing through the  Internet using strong encryption ("scrambling" to make it  incomprehensible) when necessary. Our secure server software encrypts  information, ensuring that Internet communications through our Website stay  private and protected. </li>
            <li>To enable  you to process transactions at our Website, we use cookies. </li>
            <li>Your  account information is not permanently stored on our Web server. The  information only resides on our Web server while you are viewing the  information. It is permanently stored on our secured corporate computer  systems. </li>
            <li>Our  corporate network systems, which store your account information, use proven security  controls. </li>
            <li>We have  data security staff whose sole responsibilities are to ensure the security of  the information we process and store. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Principal has policies and procedures in place to limit access  to your information to only those who have a business need to view it.</p>
          <p><strong>Secure Server Software</strong><br>
            To ensure the security of your  confidential account information, we use proven security software to encrypt  the information before it is transmitted through the Internet. We only allow  confidential information to be submitted for transmission if your browser is  compatible with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), our security software. If your  browser is not compatible, you will receive a message indicating your  transaction can not be completed because of the security risk.</p>
          <p>SSL establishes a secure connection between two parties (for  example, your browser and our web server). It is used to implement HTTPS, the  secure version of HTTP, and is an open technology supported across various  browsers (for example, Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer).&nbsp; Principal requires that you use an  SSL-enabled browser to communicate with the secure area of our site. You know  you are visiting the secure area of our site when the URL begins with  "https://...". We have also implemented a firewall to protect all of  our systems that are not part of the Internet from intrusion.</p>
          <p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br>
            Our Website (<a href="http://www.principalindia.com">www.principalindia.com</a>),  like many web sites, uses "cookies" (information stored on your  computer by your browser at our request). Cookies enable the site to  "remember" who you are so that you can get around it easier and more  efficiently. Cookies allow you to access secured information, conduct secured  transactions, and take advantage of promotional opportunities.</p>
          <p>Different web sites store the information in cookies differently. We do not  record Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Data or Information in our  cookies. Any such Information is stored in our protected systems and not in the  cookie or on the Internet.</p>
          <p><strong>Definition of Cookies</strong><br>
            A "cookie" is a small  piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser to be read back from  that browser. Cookies are a way to have the browser "remember"  specific bits of information.</p>
          <p><strong>Note: </strong>The information stored within a cookie can be  read only by the web server that originally sent the cookie. Web servers cannot  read cookies sent by other web servers.</p>
          <p><strong>Types of Cookies</strong><br>
            The two types of cookies are session cookies and persistent cookies. The key  difference between session cookies and persistent cookies is the time of  expiration. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Session       cookies expire at the end of the session. </li>
            <li>Persistent       cookies do not expire at the end of the session.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Session Cookies</strong><br>
            A session cookie may be created  when you visit a site or portion of a site. The cookie exists for the duration  of your visit. For example, a session cookie is created when you use the  Personal Login to access secured pages on the Website (<a href="http://www.principalindia.com">www.principalindia.com</a>). Depending on  the settings in your browser, you may have the option to deny the session  cookie; however, if you deny the cookie you may have trouble using the site  which relies on that cookie. Session cookies are no longer accessible after one  of the following events. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The user logs out       of a site or a portion of a site. </li>
            <li>The user shuts       down the browser. </li>
            <li>The       session is inactive for a specified length of time (often 20       minutes).&nbsp; </li>
            <li>The       user starts a new Internet session on the same computer.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Persistent Cookies</strong><br>
            A persistent cookie is used to  store your preferences for use by a single site. A persistent cookie is stored  on your hard drive and is read by your browser each time you visit the web site  that sent the cookie. Please see the Privacy page for more on the information  we collect.</p>
