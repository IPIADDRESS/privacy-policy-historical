<p class="bold less-margin-bottom">Linking Policy: Links to other sites</p>

<p>This website contains links to other sites, and other sites may link to this website. Websites linking to and from this site may have different privacy practices from the ones described here at this <a class="link-inline" href="/">website</a>. The privacy policies of the Principal apply only to its website. Visitors should read the privacy statements of other websites they visit for information regarding specific privacy practices. We will not be responsible for any breach of your privacy or any other loss arising to you as a result of a collection of your Information, Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Data or Information by such websites.</p>

<p class="bold less-margin-bottom">Information on our Website Security</p>

<p>The information for the accounts you have with Principal is kept secure and confidential through multiple security features and procedures. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures as specified under the Privacy Rules to help protect your Information including Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Data or Information from unauthorized access, usage and disclosure, such as encryption, passwords, physical security etc. by inter-alia the following:</p>

<ul><li>The information you request from our website for your accounts can only be accessed with your password. It is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.</li>
	<li>Do not disclose your password to anyone. Our employees and associates will never ask you for your password. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and information, you are responsible for keeping your password confidential.</li>
	<li>Never write your password on something others may see. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.</li>
	<li>Change your password immediately by accessing our website using your login ID, if you suspect someone has discovered it.</li>
	<li>The information you submit through our website, as well as the information we send back to you while you are visiting our website, is protected while passing through the Internet using strong encryption ("scrambling" to make it incomprehensible) when necessary. Our secure server software encrypts information, ensuring that Internet communications through our website stay private and protected.</li>
	<li>To enable you to process transactions at our website, we use cookies.</li>
	<li>Your account information is not permanently stored on our web server. The information only resides on our web server while you are viewing the information. It is permanently stored on our secured corporate computer systems.</li>
	<li>Our corporate network systems, which store your account information, use proven security controls.</li>
	<li>We have data security staff whose sole responsibilities are to ensure the security of the information we process and store.</li>
</ul><p>The Principal has policies and procedures in place to limit access to your information to only those who have a business need to view it.</p>

<p class="bold less-margin-bottom">Secure Server Software</p>

<p>To ensure the security of your confidential account information, we use proven security software to encrypt the information before it is transmitted through the Internet. We only allow confidential information to be submitted for transmission if your browser is compatible with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), our security software. If your browser is not compatible, you will receive a message indicating your transaction can not be completed because of the security risk.</p>

<p>SSL establishes a secure connection between two parties (for example, your browser and our web server). It is used to implement HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP, and is an open technology supported across various browsers (for example, Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer). Principal requires that you use an SSL-enabled browser to communicate with the secure area of our site. You know you are visiting the secure area of our site when the URL begins with "https://...". We have also implemented a firewall to protect all of our systems that are not part of the Internet from intrusion.</p>

<p class="bold less-margin-bottom">Use of Cookies</p>

<p>Our <a class="link-inline" href="/">website</a>, like many websites, uses "cookies" (information stored on your computer by your browser at our request). Cookies enable the site to "remember" who you are so that you can get around it easier and more efficiently. Cookies allow you to access secured information, conduct secured transactions, and take advantage of promotional opportunities.</p>

<p>Different websites store the information in cookies differently. We do not record Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Data or Information in our cookies. Any such Information is stored in our protected systems and not in the cookie or on the Internet.</p>

<p class="bold less-margin-bottom">Definition of Cookies</p>

<p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser to be read back from that browser. Cookies are a way to have the browser "remember" specific bits of information.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Note:</span> The information stored within a cookie can be read only by the web server that originally sent the cookie. Web servers cannot read cookies sent by other web servers.</p>

<p class="bold less-margin-bottom">Types of Cookies</p>

<p>The two types of cookies are session cookies and persistent cookies. The key difference between session cookies and persistent cookies is the time of expiration.</p>

<ul><li>Session cookies expire at the end of the session.</li>
	<li>Persistent cookies do not expire at the end of the session.</li>
</ul><p class="bold less-margin-bottom">Session Cookies</p>

<p>A session cookie may be created when you visit a site or portion of a site. The cookie exists for the duration of your visit. For example, a session cookie is created when you use the Personal Login to access secured pages on the <a class="link-inline" href="/">website</a>. Depending on the settings in your browser, you may have the option to deny the session cookie; however, if you deny the cookie you may have trouble using the site which relies on that cookie. Session cookies are no longer accessible after one of the following events.</p>

<ul><li>The user logs out of a site or a portion of a site.</li>
	<li>The user shuts down the browser.</li>
	<li>The session is inactive for a specified length of time (often 20 minutes).</li>
	<li>The user starts a new Internet session on the same computer.</li>
</ul><p class="bold less-margin-bottom">Persistent Cookies</p>

<p>A persistent cookie is used to store your preferences for use by a single site. A persistent cookie is stored on your hard drive and is read by your browser each time you visit the website that sent the cookie. Please see the Privacy page for more on the information we collect.</p>

<p class="bold less-margin-bottom">Client data collected through other modes:-</p>

<p>As mentioned above in the course of our business activity we are also required to collect, maintain and store on our servers (or our Registrar and Transfer Agents) data/information as provided by you on the application or other forms including all such information concerning your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others.</p>

<p>We do not disclose any non-public Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Data or Information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted or required under the applicable statutory /regulatory provisions, or as called upon by any Authority/Regulator/Law Enforcing Agency, or as specified in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to certain non-affiliated third parties such as, but not limited to, attorneys, accountants, auditors and persons or entities that are assessing our compliance with industry standards. We enter into contractual agreements with all non-affiliated third parties that prohibit such third parties from disclosing or using the information other than to carry out the purposes for which we disclose the information.</p>

<p>We restrict access to non-public Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Data or Information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide financial products or services to you.
