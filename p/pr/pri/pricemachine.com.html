Examples of situations where you may submit information include:</p><ul><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Account or Profile Information:</span> On some of the Websites, you may become a registered user or register for email notices from us. If you do, we ask for some basic contact information, such as a username, ZIP Code and email address. In some cases, as described below, you may enter additional account information. You also may choose to provide other information, either as part of your public profile or otherwise, such as your age, gender or interests.</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Order Processing Information:</span> We may allow checkout or payment processing features on the Websites to facilitate your purchase of products from merchants. The checkout or payment processing services are provided by a third party service provider, and all sales are made by the merchant. The service provider will collect information that is needed to process the order, such as credit card and related information like your billing address, as well as information that is needed for your order, such as your shipping address and the products that you purchased. This information is transmitted by the service provider to the merchant to complete your order. This information may be collected and stored by the third party service provider and/or the merchant in order to complete these functions. The service provider also may provide us with your contact information (such as name and email address) as well as product purchase information. Our privacy policy will apply to information that we collect or receive, the service provider's privacy policy will apply to information that it collects or receives and the merchant's privacy policy will apply to information that we, our service provider, or you provide to the merchant.</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Customer Service:</span> You may elect to provide us with information about your purchases, such as customer service requests or information about merchant issues.</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Content or Correspondence Submitted By You:</span> If you choose to post content on any of the Websites (for example, a product or merchant review, wish list, or comment or discussion forums), or submit personal correspondence to Nextag, we may collect and maintain that information in a file specific to you. Our Websites may also allow you to interact and share personal information and data with others. For example, some of the Websites allow you to create lists of products that are interesting to you. The default for certain lists is for the list to be publicly available. You may change the privacy setting of your lists as provided on the Websites. Additionally, some of the Websites may allow you to share information on social networks, as described in the section "Social Networks".</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Social Networks:</span> Some of the Websites allow you to register or login to an account you already have with a social networking account, such as Facebook. If you decide to login via a social networking account, we receive information about you from the social networking account, which can include your name, profile picture, email address, gender, user ID, and comments made on the social networking account site. Logging in to our Websites via a social networking account is always optional, but may allow you to publish your activity or interactions with our Websites to your social network account, such as Facebook or Twitter. The information we collect, and the social network's use of any information that you publish to it, may depend on the privacy settings you have with the social networking account or the social network's privacy policy, so be sure to consult your social networking account's privacy settings, and the social networking account's privacy policy and terms of use.</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Social Media Widgets:</span> Our Website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons and Widgets.

If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to improve our site, notify you if you won a contest or to send you an email newsletter or other marketing materials. We use SurveyMonkey a third party service provider to conduct these surveys; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p></li><li><p><span class="pp-subsubpoint-Heading">Links to Third Parties:</span> Our Site includes links to other Websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Nextag.

For example, we may receive product search or purchase information from merchants whose sites you visit after clicking on a product listing on our Website, updated or corrected contact information from third party vendors, credit or related information as part of vendors' fraud detection services (but only with users or merchant's permission to do so), or contact, demographic and other profile information through your interaction with us through social networking accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter (for example, by adding us as a friend on Facebook, following our Twitter account, or engaging in Facebook's "Like" feature). We also may receive or collect similar information from co-branded partners' sites that you visit.</li><p></p><li><span class="pp-subpoint-Heading">2.4 Combining Information:</span> We may combine the information that we receive about you from different sources.

The privacy policy that governs will be present on these pages so you always know whose privacy practices govern the collection and use of the information that you submit.
