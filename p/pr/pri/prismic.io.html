      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by our website, <a href="https://www.prismic.io/">www.prismic.io</a>  (the “Site”) or through our other commercial solution offerings (collectively, our “Service”).  Zengularity has created this Privacy Policy to explain what information we gather from you when you use our Service, how we may use this information, and the security approaches we use to protect your information. </p>

<p>By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your information by Zengularity in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the Site. Policy changes will apply only to information collected after the date of the change.</p>

<h2>1. What information do we collect?</h2>

<p>We collect information from you when you register for a Service, place an order, respond to communication such as e-mail, or participate in another site feature. <br>	</p>

<ul>

<li>When ordering or registering, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit card information or other information. You may, however, visit our site without providing such information.</li>

<li>We use IP addresses and session identifiers to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track user activities, to infer user interests, and to otherwise induce, deduce, and gather information about individual users and market segments.</li>

<li>Like many websites, our Site uses "cookies" to enhance your experience and gather information about visitors and visits. Please refer to the "Do we use 'cookies'?" section below for information about cookies and how we use them.</li>

<ul>

<li>To personalize the Service and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested. </li>

<li>To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests. </li>

<li>To quickly process your transactions.</li>

<li>To administer a promotion, survey or other Service feature. </li>

</ul>

<h2>3. Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?</h2>

<p>We may sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information to outside parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential for their own purposes. In the event that we sell our company, or otherwise transfer any assets of our company, we may provide your information to the purchaser so that you may continue the relationship or business with us and our products.  We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>

<h2>4. Correction/Updating Personal Information</h2>

<p>You can correct or update your personally identifiable information by re-registering or by contacting us by electronic-mail <strong>contact@prismic.io</strong>.</p>

<h2>5. Do we use "cookies" on the Site?</h2>

<p>Yes. We use Cookies on the Site.  Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. Cookies are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>

<p>  We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our Site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.  </p>

<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your Site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.</p>

<h2>6. Safeguarding Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>Zengularity follows generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use such Personal Information. However, no commercial method of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage in our systems.</p>

<h2>7. Third Party Links</h2>

<p>In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include third party links on our Site. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Site and welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).</p>

<h2>8. Questions and feedback</h2>

<p>We welcome your questions, comments, and concerns about our privacy practices. Please send us any and all feedback  or questions pertaining to the Site to prismic.io with "PRIVACY POLICY" in the subject line. </p>

<h2>9. Important Notices to Non-United States Residents</h2>

<p>It is important to note that our Services are operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any Visitor Information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using our Services and/or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer.</p>

If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2013 will receive information regarding 2012 sharing activities).</p>
