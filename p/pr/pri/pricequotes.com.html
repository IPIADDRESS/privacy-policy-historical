<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
<b>PriceQuotes.com</b> respects the privacy rights of its online visitors and is committed to providing a secure environment for them.  To demonstrate our commitment, we have adopted an Online Privacy Policy that governs the information collection practices of our Web site.
</font><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
Please note, however, that this policy applies only to sites maintained by PriceQuotes.com, and not to web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. When you link to any other sites from the PriceQuotes.com Web site, this Privacy Policy no longer applies and PriceQuotes.com does not control the activities of those sites. 


</font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="3"><b>
What information does PriceQuotes.com collect and how is it used? </b></font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
As an online referral service, PriceQuotes.com collects personally identifiable information from visitors who voluntarily opt-in to submit forms requesting free in-home estimates on various home improvement projects. This information includes name, address, telephone and email information only, and is stored and used for the purposes of directing requests to established, pre-screened third party business partners who are directly able to fulfill the estimate-requests.  
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
From time to time, PriceQuotes.com may also collect and temporarily store personal information that visitors voluntarily submit to us via email correspondence.  For example, PriceQuotes.com provides a link through which an online visitor can send email to Support.  Any personal information contained in such email is used by PriceQuotes.com for the sole purpose of responding to your questions and/or comments and is deleted immediately after we've responded.  Regardless of whether we've successfully responded, any personal information submitted to us in email is deleted within 30 days of its receipt.
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">  
In addition, we only collect and use personal information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to appropriately respond to your estimate-request, or emailed question and/or comment.  Please note that your refusal to provide personal information (e.g., name, address, etc.) in an estimate-request or email correspondence may limit our ability to respond to your request, question or comment in a timely fashion.  However, you never have to provide personal information to PriceQuotes.com in order to use our Web site. 

</font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="3"><b>
Log Files</b></font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
The only other information collected by PriceQuotes.com is in the form of logs - files that record Web site activity, including how many "hits" a particular Web page is getting (a.k.a. "click-through data").  For example, log file entries are generated every time a visitor clicks "Get Price Quote" or "Submit to request a free in-home estimate" on our site.  These entries are generated anonymously, and enable PriceQuotes.com to assess overall site activity, track interest in advertised sales, and troubleshoot technical concerns.  We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the referral services we provide you.  Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer or browser.


</font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="3"><b>
Third Parties</b></font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
Through the use of frames, PriceQuotes.com also allows visitors to submit information requests about cars, automobile warranties, insurance, and hotel reservations to identified third party websites.  For example, a visitor can submit information about a car's make, model and year to request a price quote.  In addition, once a visitor has clicked for a price quote, the visitor may be asked to supply additional information, including personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address and telephone number).  Please be aware, however, that such information is not collected or used by PriceQuotes.com at any time; the information is collected and used exclusively by the third party companies displayed within the frames on our site.  In addition, any web page on which such information is collected is operated by the third party displayed on such page, not by PriceQuotes.com. </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">

Personal information submitted to PriceQuotes.com via home improvement estimate-request forms is stored and managed privately within the PriceQuotes.com website, and is referred exclusively to pre-screened third parties who are directly capable of fulfilling your estimate-request in the area in which you live.   

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
PriceQuotes.com, however, is not responsible for the information collection and use practices of these third parties and we recommend that you refer to the privacy policy of each third party company.  If you do not want your information to be handled by these third parties, you can choose not to allow the collection of information by not using a particular service or by not providing any information at that time.

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="3"><b>
Does PriceQuotes.com use cookies or track IP Addresses?</b></font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
PriceQuotes.com does not place cookies on the systems of our site visitors. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that many Web sites store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's names, email addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are used by many sites to quickly identify your computer, saving you the time you would normally spend registering or entering your password again.  
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">

We do not keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.  An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="3"><b>
Can I choose how my personal information is used?</b></font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
<b>Estimate-Request Forms</b><br>
If you submit an estimate-request for a home-improvement project to PriceQuotes.com, and then decide that you would like to cancel your request, you may opt-out by contacting us at <a href="mailto:Support@PriceQuotes.com">Support@PriceQuotes.com</a>, and we will be happy to honor your request. However, please note, PriceQuotes.com often establishes contacts for estimate-requests within a 24 hour period. If you want to opt-out of your estimate-request after you have been contacted by one of our pre-screened home improvement business partners, you will need to make your request directly to the business itself.  PriceQuotes.com is not responsible for the opt-out policies of these businesses.  </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">

<b>Email Correspondence</b><br>
If you send PriceQuotes.com an email, and do not want PriceQuotes.com to reply to your question or comment, you may opt-out from receiving a response by contacting us at <a href="mailto:Support@PriceQuotes.com">Support@PriceQuotes.com</a> and we will be happy to honor your request.       
    

</font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="3"><b>
How do I access my personal information?</b></font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
If you wish to correct personal information submitted to us via an estimate-request form or email so that we may successfully respond to your request, question or comment, please send an email to <a href="mailto:Support@PriceQuotes.com">Support@PriceQuotes.com</a> providing us with the correct information.


</font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="3"><b>
Does PriceQuotes.com collect personal information from children under 13?</b></font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
PriceQuotes.com does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, including personal information submitted to us via email.  We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children.  We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. No information should be submitted to PriceQuotes.com in the form of email correspondence by children 12 and under. 

</font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="3"><b>
What safeguards does PriceQuotes.com use to protect my personal information?</b></font></p><p>

<font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">



<b>Estimate-Request Forms</b><br>
PriceQuotes.com only stores and uses personal information submitted voluntarily through estimate-request forms for the purpose of directing those requests to established, pre-screened business partners.  When submitted electronically, this information is accepted and stored internally and exclusively within the PriceQuotes.com website. Such information is delivered to personnel within the PriceQuotes.com company, who maintain the highest level of confidentiality, and is subsequently referred exclusively to the business partner who is able to fulfill the estimate-request. Personal information submitted through these forms is not knowingly made available to the general public, including unsolicited third parties.  The information is likewise never accumulated to be sold at large by PriceQuotes.com to muliple third parties for general marketing or any other purpose.
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
<b>Email Correspondence</b><br>
PriceQuotes.com maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security and privacy of the information you provide us via email by destroying such information within 30 days of its receipt.
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="2">
Because PriceQuotes.com does not store or use any personal information about its visitors other than for the purposes stated in this privacy policy, PriceQuotes.com does not have any mechanisms in place to ensure data quality, such as the accuracy of information submitted by visitors directly to our site.
