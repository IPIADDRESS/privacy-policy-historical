<h3 id="information-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h3>
<p><strong>A. Information You Provide</strong></p>
<p>We may collect personally identifiable information you provide to us:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When you fill out forms or fields through our Services;</li>
    <li>When you sign up for any newsletters or other materials through our Services;</li>
    <li>When you provide information to us through a third-party application, service or web site;</li>
    <li>When you communicate with us or request information about us or our Services, whether via email or other means;</li>
    <li>When you participate in online surveys hosted by us or our third-party partners;</li>
    <li>When you participate in any of our marketing initiatives, including, contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions;</li>
    <li>When you participate in forums, chats or provide user generated content or submissions; and</li>
    <li>Usage, viewing and technical data, including your device identifier or IP address, when you visit our sites, use our applications on third-party sites or platforms or open emails we send.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based information from mobile devices used to access the Services), and may use that information to customize the Services with location-based information, advertising, and features. This information may be shared with our service providers, vendors or advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>B. Information Third Parties Provide</strong></p>
<p>We also may collect information about you from sources other than from you directly, such as from social media web sites (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), other users and our business partners.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to our privacy practices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our partners, service providers or any third parties, even if our ads contain links to third party web sites and even if we have a business relationship with that third party. This policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or practices (including collection, usage, disclosure or data security practices) of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which our web site links. The inclusion of a link on our web site does not imply our or our affiliates’ endorsement of the linked site or service.</p>
<p>We encourage you to review the privacy statements of each and every web site that you visit to be sure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to you from each of them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Supplementation of Personal Information:</strong></span>&nbsp;In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submitted to us with information from third party sources. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Address Verification:</strong>&nbsp;If you provide your email address during member registration or otherwise, we use third parties in order to verify your email address information registration process.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhancement of Profile Information:</strong>&nbsp;We obtain marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers for which we think you would be interested. To enrich our profiles of individual customers, we tie this information to the personal Information you submitted to us. If you choose to link any of your social media accounts to your account, you may be given the option to log into your account using the credentials from any such social media accounts. When you choose to use this log-in feature, we may obtain information from all of the social media accounts that you have chosen to link to your account. Such information may include, for example, your name, date of birth, gender, location, profile photo, interests, activities, likes, check-ins, languages, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, professional information, contacts or similar information. You may unlink any of your social media accounts from your account by modifying your account settings. When you do so, we will stop obtaining new information from such social media accounts.</li>
    <li><strong>When We Advertise on Third Party Sites:</strong>&nbsp;When you visit a site on which we advertise and click through our advertisement, we may place cookies on your computer or use pixel tags. The information that we collect through this technology is not personally identifiable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C. Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
<p>We use tracking technologies to help provide content, to measure promotional effectiveness, to offer advertisements and/or other offerings, to recognize you and your preferences when you return to our site, to help us learn more about how our users use our sites, to personalize your experience, to assess which areas of our site you visit, and to remarket to you after you leave our site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Third Party Tracking:</strong></span>&nbsp;We permit third parties that we have agreements with to track you when you are on our web site. When you leave our web site there is a chance that these third parties may continue to track you.</p>
<p>A few tracking technologies include, without limitation, images, scripts and subsequent technology and methods later developed:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cookies:</strong></span>&nbsp;Edvisors uses “cookies” and other technologies to help us learn more about how our users use our sites and to recognize you when you return. “Cookies” (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that are stored on your browser or device by web sites, apps, online media, and advertisements&nbsp;that can be used to help recognize you as an Edvisors user and help store your preferences and activity. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies may store user preferences and other information, and can be deleted or blocked by changing the settings on your web browser. You may also be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. However, choosing to decline cookies may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on Edvisors web sites.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Web Beacons:</span></strong>&nbsp;Web beacons are small graphic images or other web programming which may be included in our services. Web beacons can be invisible to you and are used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate our Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many specific articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HTML5 and Locally Stored Objects:</strong></span>&nbsp;Similar to cookies are “locally stored objects” which we may also use for storing analytics information. Locally stored objects, such as HTML5 Web Storage, are used for similar purposes as cookies but typically may contain a greater amount and different types of data than browser cookies. Most current versions of common web browsers clear this locally stored data when you delete or clear your cookie cache. To confirm whether this is the case for the browser you are using, or to learn more about how to precisely control this data storage, please consult the Help function of your browser.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Analytics Tools and Third Party Cookies:</strong></span>&nbsp;Edvisors uses temporary cookies to help us determine how people travel through our site. A temporary cookie expires when you close your browser. This web site also uses third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to collect information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use this information only to improve this site. Such tools use permanent cookies to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, and the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Edvisors. Third-parties providing such analytics tools may also transfer this information to other third-parties where required to do so by law, or where such third-parties process the information on their behalf. The third-party analytics provider cannot associate your IP address with your personally identifiable information. By using this web site, you consent to the processing of data about you by a third-party click tracking analytics provider in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>
<p>For some of our products, we use Google Analytics Advertising Features, including Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Platform integrations, and Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting.</p>
<p>These features use first party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) for connecting the tracking activity performed by Google Analytics and its cookies with the Adwords advertising network and the DoubleClick cookie (a third party cookie). The use of these cookies allows us to optimize the delivery of ad content specifically targeted to a visitor’s interests based upon previous visits to our site.</p>
<p>You may opt out of the Google Analytics service with Google’s Browser Add-on that’s available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</p>
<p>For information in general about Google’s remarketing ad campaigns, and specifically about information regarding DoubleClick cookies and how to control and manage Google’s advertising cookies for these campaigns, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/</a></p>
<p>For another Google resource for opting out of Google’s use of cookies, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/</a></p>
<p>For another resource recommended by Google for opting out of a third party vendor’s use of cookies, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a></p>
<p>You can exercise cookie choices by visiting&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
<p>Our web site may also use, on some pages, the HotJar Analysis and Feedback tool. The HotJar service helps us analyze how visitors use our web sites. It reveals the online behavior and feedback of our web site's visitors. By combining both A) Analysis and B) Feedback tools, Hotjar gives us the 'big picture' of how to improve our web site visitor’s experience and the site’s performance. We do not collect through the HotJar service or transfer to HotJar any personally identifiable information. We only use the HotJar service to record, for some visitors on some websites and on a completely anonymous basis, information such as mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as non-personally identifiable information text you type in some of our web sites. Information about the browser (type, version, screen size, etc.), basic information about the user (IP address, language, time zone) and data containing mouse movements, clicks, and scroll events are sent to HotJar.</p>
<p>For more information see HotJar's Privacy Policy at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.hotjar.com/privacy</a>.</p>
<p>You can choose to disable the HotJar service at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out" target="_blank">https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a name="online-advertising"><strong>Online Advertising Networks and Third Party Cookies:</strong></a></span>&nbsp;Edvisors sometimes runs online ad campaigns that display Edvisors ads to you based on your likely interests. We may learn your likely interests when you use our web sites and from other companies and web sites that help us understand your likely interests. These types of ads are often called “interest-based ads” or “online behavioral advertising.” We hire “ad networks” to display these ads on web sites across the Internet. Edvisors adheres to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>
<p>The ad networks we hire to display these ads set their own cookies on your browser and use web beacons to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your likely interests. Our ad networks and Edvisors both learn which Edvisors ads are shown to you, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page the ads were displayed.</p>
<p>Third-party companies may use non-cookie technologies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity including your activities on this web site. These technologies may be used directly on this web site. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, we may share information collected from you with third party data providers including web log data and/or hashed email addresses. Third party data providers may place anonymous cookies on your browser to receive customized ads or content, which you can opt out of at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>
<p>For more general information about interest-based ads and your choices, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>
<p><strong>D. How We Respond to Browser “Do Not Track” Signals</strong></p>
<p>Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to web sites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. We do not respond to web browser “Do Not Track” signals at this time.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="childrens-privacy-policy">2. Children’s Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This web site is not directed or otherwise promoted for use by children under the age of thirteen (13). Edvisors does not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our web sites or Services about children under age thirteen. If a child whom we know to be under age thirteen sends personal information to us online, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify parents or seek parental consent, and will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. We are not, however, responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose web sites may contain links to ours. Because we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third-parties. We do not knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information via our site.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-protect-your-information">3. How We Protect Your Information</h3>
<p>We take the security of your personal information very seriously. Edvisors maintains certain physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help protect our data. We require all third party advertising and marketing partners with whom we share your personally identifiable information to make reasonable efforts to protect your information, however we "do not guarantee" the security of personal information sold to or shared with third parties.</p>
<p>We cannot, however, ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Services and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, electronic, or administrative safeguards.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-use-your-information">4. How We Use Your Information</h3>
<p>In addition to the uses described in the Information We Collect section of this Privacy Policy, we use your information to provide you the services you request (such as student lending, promotions and scholarship information), to customize our sites, to improve your user experience and our services, and to provide information about other products and services which we think might interest you.</p>
<p>In addition, we use your information to operate, administer, test and improve our sites, and to customize and improve the user experience. We may also use your information for our general business purposes such as analytics, market research and financial reporting.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-share-your-information">5. How We Share Your Information</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Edvisors Sites:</strong></span>&nbsp;All Edvisors’ sites have access to and use information about you for the purposes described above.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Advertisers and Marketing Partners:</strong></span>&nbsp;We may share your information with and/or sell your information to third parties whose products and services we think may be of interest to you, such as educational institutions; financial companies, such as those that make or arrange student loans and other financial products; non-financial institutions, such as retailers who sell a wide range of products and services to consumers; direct marketing companies; or nonprofit organizations. These third parties may be domestic or international.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Third Party Market Research (MR) Companies:</strong></span>&nbsp;We may also share your personal information and/or social-demographic information, including, without limitation, a unique identification number (“UID”), postal code, gender, marital status, education, ethnicity/race (where permitted by applicable law), employment related information, and non-personally identifiable information on household members, with third party sample/market research companies (individually each a “Third Party MR Company” and collectively the “Third Party MR Companies”) for the purpose of identifying survey opportunities that you may be eligible for through the Third Party MR Companies. If you are eligible for a survey opportunity, the Third Party MR Company will provide your unique identification number and a survey link to us and we will invite you to participate in the survey. We will not share your name, email address, or phone number with the Third Party MR Companies. In connection with the sharing of your information with a Third Party MR Company, your information may be transferred and stored outside of your country of residence, including, without limitation, in the United States. If you have any questions about this data sharing, you may reach us during regular business hours at (888) 972-1010. Your participation in such survey opportunities does not entitle you to any benefits offered by, or membership with, the Third Party MR Companies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Analytics Partners:</strong></span>&nbsp;We may share your information with third parties who use the information solely for analytical purposes.</p>
<p>We make certain anonymized or aggregated information (which is information that does not personally identify you) available to third parties, to: (a) comply with various reporting obligations; (b) for business or marketing purposes; or (c) to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Service.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong></span>&nbsp;From time to time we may use third parties to perform specific services, such as sending emails or newsletters to Edvisors users. If we use a third party to provide specific services, then information (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third-party service providers are only allowed to use personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the specific services requested by Edvisors. The third-party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third-party sites found on our sites. These third party links are governed by a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.edvisors.com/terms-privacy-disclaimer/#links-to-other-sites" target="_blank">more specific provision below</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Disclosure to Law Enforcement and Similar Disclosures:</strong></span>&nbsp;While Edvisors strives to protect the personal information of all users, Edvisors will disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a government entity, or if it believes in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As Part of a Business Transfer:</strong></span>&nbsp;We may share your information, including your personal information, and usage information with any parent, subsidiary or affiliate entity for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy. We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer some or all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of Edvisors; or (ii) in connection with any merger, acquisition, consolidation, restructuring, bankruptcy, sale of assets or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates. We may transfer the corresponding information regarding our customers and users of the Services, including personal information, to third parties evaluating or facilitating the transaction.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business, equity interests, or assets (including the services) to an affiliate or non-affiliated third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation, and without notice or any compensation to you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Promotions:</strong></span>&nbsp;We may share your information in connection with any promotion you enter on or through the web sites, as necessary to administer, market, sponsor, or fulfill the promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (for example, to provide winners’ lists or make required filings as appropriate) or in accordance with the applicable Official Rules of the promotion/sweepstakes you enter.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Social Media Features:&nbsp;</strong></span>Our web site may include Social Media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our web site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Third Party Comment System:</strong></span>&nbsp;We use a third party online comment system called Disqus. Disqus is a third party application that allows visitors to post comments on our Site and connect those and other comments across multiple sites, including third party websites. To post a comment, you may have to create a Disqus account, which may entail providing some of your personal information to Disqus. Among the login options, there is also a single-sign-on feature for your convenience in which you can login to Disqus through a third-party social media connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect or Twitter using the credentials you provided when registering for those sites. We encourage you to read Disqus’ privacy policy (link below) to understand how Disqus collects and uses your information when you login using a social media login.</p>
<p>When you post a comment on the Site, Disqus will collect information about your visit to this and other sites, including the information you post and your IP address. Again, if you register with and use Disqus, Disqus may collect and use other information from and about you. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Disqus' collection or use of your PII or other information. We encourage you to review Disqus' privacy policy to learn more about their privacy practices here:&nbsp;<a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Offer Walls:</strong></span>&nbsp;Our web sites may display third-party advertisers’ offers. These advertisers may in turn display their own offers. These offers are not controlled by or made by Edvisors. These offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your geographic area or other anonymous demographic information. After clicking on one of these offers, you may no longer be on a site hosted by Edvisors or a partnering Third Party Platform. Edvisors may provide points or other virtual rewards to users in exchange for interaction with an advertisement or completion of a specific activity in furtherance of the advertiser’s promotion. Such activities may include signing up for an account with the advertiser. To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier and anonymous demographic information may be shared with the offer provider. This information is used to ensure proper crediting of your account, prevent fraud or duplicate offers and to resolve any customer service inquiries that may arise. Once you complete an offer, you may then be returned to an Edvisors website or service.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Consent:</strong></span> In addition to the other sharing practices described in this Privacy Policy, we may also share your information with third parties with your consent.</p>
<h3 id="links-to-other-sites">6. Links to Other Sites</h3>

<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights: A Notice to California Users (California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</strong></p>
<p>California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California residents asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of California residents to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the California resident has exercised an option to opt out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.</p>
<p>Any California residents who have an established relationship with Edvisors may opt out of Edvisors disclosing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Under California law, third parties include affiliates of Edvisors. If you do not want Edvisors to disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes you can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.edvisors.com/third-party-opt-out/" target="_blank">opt out here</a>.</p>

In order to effectuate removal of such content or information, you may reach us during regular business hours at (888) 972-1010.</p>
<p>The removal of content does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted on any of our online platforms by the registered user.</p>
<p>We do not advertise or market any of the products or services identified in Chapter 22.1 Sec. 22580 (i) to users we have actual knowledge are under 18 years of age.</p>
