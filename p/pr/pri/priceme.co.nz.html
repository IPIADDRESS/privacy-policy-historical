including the <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0028/232.0/DLM296645.html" target="_blank">Privacy Act 1993​</a>, any applicable Privacy Codes and other laws when dealing with your information.<br>
We will also comply with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation to the extent that this applies to information we

<h3>2. What information do we collect?</h3>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<p class="faqsspan">
We collect information so that we can provide you with our Services, and so that we can build new Services that make life easier for consumers when shopping online. We may collect the following personal information:
</p>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('3')">2.1 Information you give us, such as: <span id="span3" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<span id="3" class="display-none faqsspan">
<strong>Account information</strong>. When you sign up for a Service, we may require your name, username, password, email address or other personal information.<br>
<strong>Profile information</strong>. Certain Services may require you to complete a profile, which may include personal information such as your postal and delivery addresses, phone number. Parts of your profile (like your member number, user name, and feedback history) may be part of your public profile page, and will be publicly visible to others.<br>
<strong>Application forms</strong>. We collect information when you complete an application for any of our Services or for services that we connect to.<br>
<strong>Listing content</strong>. We collect the listing content when you list your products, which may include your description of the listing, photos and your user name. Listing content may include embedded information or other metadata.<br>
<strong>Payment information</strong>. PriceMe’s comparison service is free to use for regular consumers and no payment information is therefore not collected. However, we do collect financial information for retailers and brands (like your bank account or credit card information) that make payments to us or third parties using our Services (see below for how we use and hold this).<br>
<strong>Communications and phone calls</strong>. When you communicate with us or other Users in relation to a Service, we may collect information about your communication and any other information you provide.<br>
<strong>Other information</strong>. You may otherwise provide us information directly (by email or in other formats), such as when you provide feedback, fill in a form, conduct a search, update or add information to our Services, respond to surveys or other research activities, participate in promotions, upload into our Services or use other features of our Services.
</span>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('4')">2.2 Information we automatically collect, such as: <span id="span4" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<span id="4" class="display-none faqsspan">
<strong>Usage information</strong>. We collect information about your interactions with our Services, such as the pages or other content you view, your searches for products, price alerts and favourites that you have made, and emails and messages generated through your use of the Services.<br>
<strong>Location information</strong>. When you use certain features of our Services, we may collect different types of information about your general location (e.g. your physical or postal address or your device’s IP address) or more specific location information (e.g. precise location from your mobile GPS). Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable the use of location services for applications in the device’s settings menu.<br>
<strong>Analytics</strong>. We automatically collect analytics information when you use our Services, even if you have not created an account or logged in. We may use third party providers like Google Analytics to help us with this. Information collected includes, among other things: details about how you’ve used our Services (including links to third party applications), your IP address, access times, hardware and software information, device information, device event information (e.g. crashes, browser type), and the pages, applications or services you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using our Services.<br>
<strong>Transaction and financial Information</strong>. We may collect information related to your transactions on our Services, including the date and time, amounts charged, and other related transaction details. Depending on your settings and the Services you use, we may collect financial information relating to your use of our Services and your financial history.<br>
<strong>Via cookies and similar technologies</strong>. We use cookies, pixels, beacons and other similar technologies to collect and store information about you when you use our Services (e.g. through Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager) and this collection may occur across devices. Cookies may be "session" cookies (which temporarily store information and expire when you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (e.g. when you select "remember me" when logging in). We may also allow our business partners to use these technologies on our Services (e.g. for advertising and remarketing), or engage others to track your behaviour on our behalf. You may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings and may opt out of certain advertising as described in clause 3.4 below. Some Services also use social media features (e.g. the Facebook Like button or widgets) which may collect your IP address and the pages you visit, and which are generally governed by the terms of the social media business providing the features.
</span>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('5')">2.3 Information from third parties or external sources, such as: <span id="span5" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<span id="5" class="display-none faqsspan">
<strong>Information from third party services you use</strong>. If you link, connect, or log in to your account with a third party service (e.g. Facebook), the third party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorised by you via your privacy settings at that service.<br>
<strong>Background Information about you</strong>. For some Services, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, we may request that you provide or are subject to background or credit checks, and we may obtain reports from public records (for example the Company’s office).<br>
<strong>Analytics information</strong>. We may collect analytics information from third parties (e.g. we may use Google Analytics, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest and Google AdWords. Analytics information is generally anonymised, but may include the device you’re using, the applications you use, your operating system, your IP address, and your geo-demographic information.<br>
<strong>Advertising information</strong>. Unless you have opted out, we may receive information about you and your activities on and off our Services through our partnerships, or about your experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks.<br>
<strong>Information from public sources</strong>. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you that is publicly available (e.g. we may collect your property information held by local councils for our Property Insights Service).

We may also allow our business partners to use these technologies on our Services (e.g. for advertising and remarketing), or engage others to track your behaviour on our behalf. You may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings and may opt out of certain advertising as described in clause 3.4 below.

<h3>4. Who do we disclose your information to?</h3>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<p class="faqsspan">
We may need to disclose your personal information to others to provide you with our Services, to improve our Services or uphold the law or our terms. As described above, we may disclose your information to PriceMe Partner sites. We may also disclose your personal information in the following ways:
</p>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('12')">4.1 To our service providers, to provide and manage our Services. <span id="span12" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<span id="12" class="display-none faqsspan">
In order to provide and manage our Services, we may need to disclose some of your personal information to our third party service providers. These providers have limited access to your personal information to perform tasks on our behalf, and are contractually obliged to use your personal information consistently with this Privacy Policy. These disclosures will be consistent with the Service-specific terms and the rest of this privacy policy.
</span>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('13')">4.2 To other third parties, such as: <span id="span13" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<span id="13" class="display-none faqsspan">
<strong>Advertisers providing customised ads, unless you opt out</strong>. We may give advertisers your personal information to facilitate them sending you promotional messages, marketing, advertising, and other information that may be of interest to you (unless you unsubscribe). This may be provided on our Services or on services provided by those advertisers. The advertiser’s own privacy policy will apply to the personal information we send them. Depending on the privacy policy of the advertiser, the advertiser may combine the personal information we give them with personal information they hold about you, to assist with their advertising to you. This is particularly relevant for Google’s Customer Match and Facebook Customer Audience (it’s possible to opt out of both these programmes on Google’s and Facebook’s sites. If any personal information is shared, we require that it is done so securely.
</span>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('14')">4.3 To authorities or other entities to uphold the law or our terms, for example: <span id="span14" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<span id="14" class="display-none faqsspan">
<strong>For legal compliance or law enforcement purposes</strong>. We may disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement or government agencies, or third parties, to the extent we believe that disclosure is appropriate or permitted by the Privacy Act.<br>
<strong>To protect the rights, property or safety of us, our Users or others</strong>. This includes collecting money you owe us and making such disclosures as are necessary for the purpose of trust, safety and assurance in accordance with clause 3.3 above.
</span>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('15')">4.4 To others where necessary to reorganise or sell our business. <span id="span15" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<span id="15" class="display-none faqsspan">
If we undertake or are involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganisation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets. In this event, we will notify you before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
</span>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('16')">4.5 To other third parties, where your identity is anonymised. <span id="span16" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<span id="16" class="display-none faqsspan">
We may share non-personally identifiable information (e.g., aggregated information about our Users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual User), for industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.
</span>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('17')">4.6 Also, some interactions with our sites and Services may be subject to additional third party terms. For example: <span id="span17" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<span id="17" class="display-none faqsspan">
<strong>External links. Our Services may contain links to third party retailers, websites or services</strong>. We don’t own or control those retailers, websites or services or endorse them in any way and, if you interact with them, you may be providing information directly to the third party concerned. The third parties will have their own rules about the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to review their privacy policies accordingly.<br>
<strong>Certain embedded third party services</strong>. Some of our Services use embedded third party services, e.g. Google Maps. Use of those services may be subject to third party terms, e.g. Google Maps Additional Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.<br>
<strong>Information indexed by search engines</strong>. Information you share publicly on our Services may be indexed through third party search engines. We do not control the practices of third party search engines, and they may use caches containing your outdated information.

<h3>5. How do we hold and protect your information?</h3>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<p class="faqsspan">
We take your privacy seriously. We also work hard to ensure we keep your personal information safe and to avoid any harm to you or your personal information. We would notify you and related authorities if a potentially harmful data breach of your personal information did occur. We delete personal information after it is no longer reasonably necessary for us to use it. In particular:
</p>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('18')">5.1 We use industry recognised security practices and measures. <span id="span18" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<span id="18" class="display-none faqsspan">
We are committed to keeping your personal information as safe and secure as possible and follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.<br>
We continuously implement and update our administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorised access, loss, destruction, or alteration. However, despite all of our measures we can’t 100% guarantee the security of the transmission or storage of your personal information.
</span>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('19')">5.2 We store your information in New Zealand or overseas subject to standards that will comply with our privacy obligations <span id="span19" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<span id="19" class="display-none faqsspan">
You authorise us to transfer, store, and process your personal information in New Zealand and possibly other countries. Where we store information overseas, or a third party we use to provide our Services stores information overseas (e.g. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure), we will ensure that the storage complies with New Zealand privacy obligations.
</span>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('20')">5.3 We retain your information as long as reasonably required, unless we are legally required to hold it longer. <span id="span20" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<div id="20" class="display-none faqsspan">
<div>
<div>We will keep your personal information for as long as is reasonably required for us to use it in accordance with this policy, unless we are required by law to hold it longer. In particular, we may retain:</div>
<ul>
<li>All listing content after listings have expired. We do this for various reasons, including in case of disputes, to help prevent fraud and facilitate legal processes,
to comply with financial record-keeping and to help personalise or recommend products in future. Listing content may also persist elsewhere when third parties access and cache listings while they are live. For example, Google do this when they index the web for searching and so old listings may show in Google searches for a period of time.</li>
<li>Other personal information that is deleted by you may persist for a limited time in our backup systems.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faqsdiv">
<h4 onclick="ShowHide('21')">5.4 Credit card Information is held subject to stringent payments industry standards. <span id="span21" class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down faqsche"></span></h4>
<span id="21" class="display-none faqsspan">
Credit and debit card information is sensitive and we protect it to stringent security standards, which at a minimum comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ("PCI standards"). We use a number of procedures and different technologies to help protect your credit and debit card information from unauthorised access, use and disclosure. Our compliance with PCI is audited every year.<br>
For some Services we may allow you to save your card information for subsequent use (and, to make life easier for you, we may use your saved card information for other Services we offer where you’re able to make card payments).
