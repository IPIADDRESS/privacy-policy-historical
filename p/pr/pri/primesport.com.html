            <p> PrimeSport International is an independent, privately 
              owned company engaged in the business of buying and selling tickets 
              at a premium for sporting events, concerts, and theatre. The amount 
              charged over the face value of the tickets represents our fair compensation 
              for the difficulty involved in obtaining premium seating to hard-to-get 
              and sold-out events.</p>
            <p>PrimeSport International is in <b>no way affiliated</b> 
              with any box office or official organizers (e.g. FIFA, ATP, NBA,
