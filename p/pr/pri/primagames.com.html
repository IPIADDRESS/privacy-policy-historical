The policies below are applicable to the primagames.com website and the  Prima eGuide store (collectively the "Prima Games Website"), produced and maintained by Prima Games and its vendors (collectively "Prima Games").  Prima Games is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of users of its interactive products and services.  Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for users, and in particular, ensure that kids' information is protected.  If you don't find your concern addressed here, feel free to contact us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:websupportent@primagames.com">websupportent@primagames.com</a>  or phone 800-733-3000.<p></p>

<p><b>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</b></p>

<p>Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you on-line or off-line. Prima Games only collects personal information from our online visitors on a voluntary basis and only during (1) contests (registration or claiming a prize), (2) during customer support or technical service requests, (3) registration for specific services, (4) marketing surveys and email campaigns, (5) registration for membership on our sites, or (6) when you order products (such as eGuides) from us online. Information collected may include your name, e-mail address, phone number, home address, birth date and credit card information. We do not require personal information to obtain access to any of our sites; however, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.</p>

<p>In addition to the use of personal information to operate the Prima Games website, Prima Games may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by Prima Games or shared with third parties.  This collective data helps us determine how our customers use parts of the website, so we can improve our website and ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible.  We also provide statistical "ratings" information to our Prima Games partners about how our users collectively use the Prima Games website.  We do this so they too can understand how people use their areas of our website in order for them to provide you with the best possible experience as well.  This information is also used to generate advertising rates.  Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "Cookies" "IP addresses" or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.</p>

<p>Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.</p>


<p><b>Information We Ask About You </b></p>

<p>Sometimes, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a service or when you order a product.  We will need certain information -- such as name, Internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer, credit card number -- in order to provide that service or product to you. We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested.  You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for the product or service.  We also may ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the Internet, but you may always choose whether to respond or not. </p>

<p><b>Policies for Children Under 13</b></p>

<p>Safeguarding the personal information of children is extremely important to us.  We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the site.  No information should be submitted to or posted on the Prima Games website by children under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.  Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, Prima Games does not knowingly collect or provide any personally identifying information of children under 13 years of age, regardless of its source, for any purpose whatsoever.  Prima Games may, however, collect certain personally identifying information to protect the integrity of the web site and the safety of children under 13 using the website.  In the event Prima Games collects such information, the information will be deleted from the Prima Games systems as soon as possible.  We do not use any information collected from users under 13 years of age for any marketing or promotional purpose whatsoever.  We do not allow children under 13 years of age to be listed in any member directories or to receive direct marketing communications from Prima Games or other third parties.  </p>

<p>We assume that if you are legally providing us with credit card information, you are an adult or are otherwise authorized to do so. In no event however, should you provide us with any information if you are under age 13. We're sorry, but you will need to ask your parent to make the purchase for you. </p>

<p>There are a number of emerging standards in the area of children's privacy that will affect how we process a child's personal information in the future.  We are monitoring these changes and will redesign our systems in order to comply with these new requirements.</p>

<p><b>Parents and Guardians </b></p>

<p>We encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. We also ask you to check back here regularly to see what our latest policies are, particularly those relating to children. </p>

<p>You should be aware that if your children voluntarily disclose their names, e-mail addresses or other information on bulletin boards or chat areas of other Web sites, such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. We suggest that you discourage your child from providing such information on this site or elsewhere unless you are confident that the information will not be misused.</p>


<p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>

<p><i>What about "Cookies"?</i></p>

<p>"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  "Cookies" make web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at our website.  The use of "Cookies" is standard in the Internet industry, and many major websites use them to provide useful features for their customers.  For example, by showing how and when guests use the site, "Cookies" help us see which areas are popular and which are not.  Many improvements and updates to the website are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed.  This information is most easily tracked with "Cookies."  "Cookies" in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer.  Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept "Cookies."  If you prefer, you can set yours to refuse "Cookies" or to alert you when "Cookies" are being sent.  However, it is possible that some areas of the website, such as the shopping, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so.</p>

<p><i>How We Do Not Use Cookies </i></p>

<p>The Prima Games website never uses "Cookies" to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a "Cookie."  Except as described in this Security and Privacy Policy, Prima Games does not use information transferred through "Cookies" for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties other than our fulfillment and service companies that help us provide a specific service to you. We do not use Cookies" to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as online shopping and contest registration (where a "Cookie" allows you to enter a contest every day without registering again each time).  You may occasionally get "Cookies" from our advertisers.  We do not control these "Cookies," and these "Cookies" are not subject to our "Cookie" policy.  The use of advertising "Cookies" sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. </p>

<p>Except as disclosed in this privacy policy, Prima Games does not use or disclose information about your individual visits to our site or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies (other than fulfillment and service companies that help us provide a specific service to you, e.g. distribution of our eGuides).  Prima Games does not sell any customer lists or e-mail addresses. We contract with certain trusted companies to act on our behalf by performing such functions as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.  Those entities are provided with only the information needed to perform the specific function and they may not use such information for other purposes.

In many cases these discounts would be an added benefit to you.  Prima Games may also permit use of your personal information to allow other companies to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you.  If Prima Games proposes to permit such use of your personal information, you will be provided an opportunity to instruct Prima Games not to allow such contact.  You may contact us at any time in order to direct us to remove your information from future mailings.</p>
