					  <h1>Pricefalls.com Privacy Policy</h1>
      
<p>This Pricefalls.com Privacy Policy (this "Policy") tells you about how we collect, use, and protect your personal information. To see a summary of this Policy, and for more information to answer your privacy concerns, please go to our Privacy Central page. By accepting this Policy and the Pricefalls.com User Agreement (the "User Agreement") during registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Policy. This Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users and is otherwise effective on Pricefalls.com as of 2008.</p>

<p><b>I. Applicability</b></p>

<p>This Policy describes how we handle your personal information for our services on Pricefalls.com websites. It applies generally to the Pricefalls.com websites and content and other related websites where a link to this Policy appears in the footer of the page. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Pricefalls.com does not own or control, or to people that Pricefalls.com does not employ or manage.</p>
  
<p>Some Pricefalls.com-branded websites or websites we operate may be governed by separate privacy policies. The policy that applies on any of our domains or subdomains is always the policy to which a link appears in the footer of each website. Our subsidiaries’ and joint ventures’ privacy practices, if applicable, are similar to those described in this Policy. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, we strive to provide a consistent set of privacy practices throughout the global Pricefalls.com trading community.</p> 

<p><b>TRUSTe</b></p>

<p>We are a TRUSTe licensee. If we do not respond to your question, please contact TRUSTe. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through the websites covered by this policy. It does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from Pricefalls.com websites.</p>

<p><b>II. Collection</b></p>

<p>You may browse Pricefalls.com websites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.</p> 

<p>We may collect and store the following personal information when you register with Pricefalls.com and when you use our products and services</p>

<ul>
<li>email address, physical contact information, and (depending on the service used) sometimes financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers;</li>
<li>transactional information based on your activities on Pricefalls.com websites (such as bidding, buying, selling, item and content you generate or that relates to your account); 
</li><li>shipping, billing and other information you provide to purchase or ship an item;</li> 
<li>community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through Pricefalls.com websites, and correspondence sent to us;</li>
<li>other information from your interaction with Pricefalls.com websites, services, content and advertising, including computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from Pricefalls.com websites, ad data, IP address and standard web log information;</li> 
<li>additional information we ask you to submit to authenticate yourself or if we believe you are violating site policies</li> 
<li>information from other companies, such as demographic and navigation data; and</li>
<li>other supplemental information from third parties (for example, if you incur a debt to Pricefalls.com, we will generally conduct a credit check by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, as permitted by law).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>III. Marketing</b></p>

<p>We don't sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our services, content and advertising. If you don't wish to receive marketing communications from us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply indicate your preference in My Pricefalls.com or by following the directions provided with the communication or advertisement.</p>

<p><b>IV. Use</b></p>

<p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. You agree that we may use your personal information to:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide the services and customer support you request;</li>
<li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li>
<li>prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities,</li>
<li>enforce the User Agreement;</li>
<li>customize, measure and improve our services, content and advertising;</li>
<li>tell you about our services, conduct targeted marketing, and provide service updates, and promotional offers based upon the communication preferences you have comunicated to us; and</li>
<li>compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties.</li></ul>

<p><b>V. Our Disclosure of Your Information</b></p>

<p>We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, and the User Agreement, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. Such information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<p>We may also share your personal information with:</p>


<ul>
<li>Members of the Pricefalls.com Inc. corporate family to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about products, services and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you’ve requested their services.</li>

<li>Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs and co-branded credit cards).</li>
 
<li>Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service).</li>

<li>Law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity. Other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors and illegal activity, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</li></ul>

<p><b>VI. Information You Share on Pricefalls.com</b>
Your User ID is displayed throughout Pricefalls.com (and so available to the public), and is connected to all of your Pricefalls.com activity. Other people can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, storefronts, feedback, ratings and associated comments.
