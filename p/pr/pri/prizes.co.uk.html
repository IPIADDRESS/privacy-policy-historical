<p>
<strong>Information collected from members</strong><br>
Your personal information is collected when you register with us and/or when you enter a prize draw. Your personal information is kept private and only used to administer your membership of the website - and to administer prize draw entry databases.<br>
</p><p>
<strong>Tell a friend information</strong><br>
Our prize draws often include a form allowing you to send the page link to a friend. This information is ONLY used to send them an automatic email and is not used for any other purpose, although to information is stored simply to log whether your friend has responded to your email. This allows us to reward you in some way for promoting the prize draw.<br>
</p><p>
<strong>Third parties</strong><br>
No information about you is given to any third party under any circumstance without your prior permission. Each prize draw includes an opt in box inviting you to say yes to the draw sponsor sending you further offers. If you tick yes to such boxes, your personal details shall be passed to the sponsor and you will then be added to their database. To reverse this opt in from that point on, you shall have to contact the third party. <b>Please note:</b> If you tick a box on one prize draw you are only agreeing to opt in for sponsors of that prize draw.<br>
</p><p>
<strong>Member emails and newsletters</strong><br>
A condition of membership of Prizes is that you agree to receive our member newsletters, which are sent out no more than once per week. These newsletters shall be sent by us under our brand, with our content - through the mailing service we use to send out our emails.
<br>In addition to the newsletter, you will receive a number of auto-responder emails that are triggered by you:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>Entry confirmation when you enter a draw
</li><li>Follow-up email announcing the winner of a draw
</li></ul> <br>
<p>
<strong>Third party advertisement promotions</strong><br>
On each of our prize draws we include an option for you to receive offers from our third party advertisers. These take the form of solus emails featuring content designed and written by the advertisers, but are always sent by us with our brand at the top. You can opt into or out of third party offers at any time without affecting your membership.<br>
</p><p> 
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
We use a 'cookie' as a short-cut to identify you when you come back to the Prizes site. We don't store any passwords or such like in the cookie - just a simple code that lets us know you've been here before, which we can use (for instance) to hide messages that might be shown to first-timers. <br>
</p><p>
