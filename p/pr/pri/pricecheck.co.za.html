							                            <li><strong>"Cookies" Information: </strong>When
							                            you access the Website, we may send one or more cookies (small
							                            text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters) to
							                            your computer to collect certain Usage Details.  We may use both
							                            session cookies (which disappear after you close your browser)
							                            and persistent cookies (which remain after you close your browser

							                            <li><strong>Web Beacons: </strong>Our
							                            Website may contain electronic image requests (called a
							                            "single-pixel gif" or "web beacon" request) that allow us
							                            to count page views and to access cookies.  Any electronic image
							                            viewed as part of a web page (including an ad banner) can act as
							                            a web beacon.  Web beacons are typically 1-by-1 pixel files (so
							                            small that you would likely not realize that they are there), but
							                            their presence can usually be seen within a browser by clicking
							                            on "View" and then on "Source". We
							                            may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters that
							                            we send to opt-in subscribers in order to count how many
							                            newsletters have been read.  Our web beacons do not collect,
							                            gather, monitor or share any personally identifiable information.
							                             They are just the technique we use to compile anonymous
							                            information about the Website and Service usage.</li>

							                    Optional Details.</li>

							                    <li>We may use your <strong>Usage Details</strong> to (a) automatically provide

							                    such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (d) track

							                <ol>
							                    <li>
							                    Our holding company, MIH Internet Africa (Pty) Ltd, and other
							                    divisions or companies within the group of companies to which we
							                    belong, being the Naspers Ltd group of companies which includes
							                    companies registered in countries other than South Africa so as to
							                    provide joint content and services like registration, transactions
							                    and customer support, to help detect and prevent potentially
							                    illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide
							                    decisions about their products, services and communications.
							                    Members of our corporate family will only use this information to

							                    </li>

							                    <li>
							                    Our Merchants, but only in the event and to the extent that you,
							                    the User, have expressly authorised such disclosure beforehand.
							                    The reason for this is that Merchants sometimes request a User's
							                    details in order to follow up with such User as to his/her
							                    grievances regarding such Merchant's product/s.  Should PriceCheck
							                    receive any such request from a Merchant in relation to a User, we
							                    will notify the User thereof via email and request his/her
							                    permission to such disclosure. Please note that Merchants have
							                    their own privacy policies, and PriceCheck will not be held
							                    responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to,
							                    their information practices, once a User’s personal information

							                    authorisation in accordance with this clause, or by the User
							                    directly when transacting with such Merchants.  We similarly will
							                    not be liable in any way for the manner in which a User may use or
							                    disclose any Merchant-related information provided to him/her
							                    directly by such Merchant.
