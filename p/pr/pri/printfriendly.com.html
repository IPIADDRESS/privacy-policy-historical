Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using PrintFriendly's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. PrintFriendly will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, PrintFriendly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when PrintFriendly believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of PrintFriendly, third parties or the public at large.
