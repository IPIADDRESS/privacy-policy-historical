<p>It is <strong>Print Friendly &amp; PDF</strong>'s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Print Friendly &amp; PDF collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Print Friendly &amp; PDF's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Print Friendly &amp; PDF's visitors use its services. From time to time, Print Friendly &amp; PDF's may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its service.</p>
<!--<p>Print Friendly & PDF's also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Print Friendly & PDF only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>-->

<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Print Friendly &amp; PDF's websites choose to interact with Print Friendly &amp; PDF in ways that require Print Friendly &amp; PDF to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Print Friendly &amp; PDF gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors that purchase Print Friendly &amp; PDF Ad-Free service to provide the necessary personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Print Friendly &amp; PDF collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Print Friendly &amp; PDF.

We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Print Friendly &amp; PDF takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
