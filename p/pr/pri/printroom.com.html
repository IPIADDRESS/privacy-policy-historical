<center><font size="5"><b>Privacy Statement</b></font></center>

<p><b>Printroom.com has a firm commitment to ensuring the privacy of our customers. This page
will provide you with Printroom's (<a href="http://www.printroom.com">www.printroom.com</a>)
information gathering and dissemination practices.</b></p>

<hr size="1">

<p>Printroom has adopted this Privacy Statement to explain what personal information we need,
why we need it and how we protect it. The information we collect about you is used to process
your order efficiently and to provide you with a personalized and enjoyable online experience.
Details about our privacy policy are described below.  This policy may change from time to
time so please check back periodically.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Security</b></font><br>
Printroom utilizes technology, security features, and strict policy guidelines to safeguard
the privacy of our customer information.  When you place orders or access your account
information, we offer the use of a secure server and secure server software (SSL)-based
encryption of all information you input.  In addition, all customer data we collect is
protected against unauthorized access.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Your Printroom Account</b></font><br>
When you sign up with Printroom, you establish a password-protected personal account for
storing your digital images and managing print orders and other services.  You and you
alone control who may view the images stored in your Printroom account.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Information Collection and Use</b></font><br>
When you create a new customer profile, we ask for your name, company, mailing address,
and e-mail address. When you place an order, we ask for your credit card number and card
expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of
your order status. Once an online order has been confirmed, credit card information is
not reused.</p>

<p>We may use the information we collect to periodically notify you about important changes
to the Web site, new Printroom products and services, and special offers that may be of
interest to you.  If you would rather not receive this information, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:printroom_support@lexarmedia.com">printroom_support@lexarmedia.com</a>.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Protecting your photos</b></font><br>
Only you decide if and when your photographs are shared.  We are committed to keeping your
photographs private and secure. Your photographs are never made publicly accessible, and
are shared only by your explicit action.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Use of "Cookies"</b></font><br>
Printroom uses cookies (small pieces of information that are stored by your Web browser on
your computer's hard drive) to recall your email address and other information stored in
your customer profile. For example, our Online Store uses cookies to remember the contents
of your shopping cart as you make your selections, and to recall your billing address. Our
cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. Most browsers automatically
accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a
cookie, you can still use most of the features of our site.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Disclosure</b></font><br>
Printroom does not currently, but may in the future, sell, trade, rent, or otherwise provide
your personal information to others (except as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other
legal process).  We may also provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic
patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics
will include no personally identifying information.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Children under 13</b></font><br>
Printroom takes children's privacy seriously.  Printroom does not seek to collect personal
information about children through any of its web sites.  If a child submits information
through any part of our website and we know that the person submitting the information is
a child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any
purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Surveys and Contests</b></font><br>
From time to time, you may have the opportunity to enter a contest or fill out a customer
survey. We may ask you for personal or demographic information such as your name, gender,
address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify the winner. We may
also ask questions about your camera such as you camera's make and model, and your use of
digital images.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>External Links and Partners' Collection of Information</b></font><br>
This site contains links to other sites. Printroom is not responsible for the privacy
practices or the content of such other Web sites.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Your Consent</b></font><br>
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Printroom.
If in the future we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that
you are always aware of the kind of information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances we disclose it.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Questions? Comments?</b></font><br>
Printroom welcomes your questions and comments about privacy. Please send e-mail to
<a href="mailto:printroom_support@lexarmedia.com">printroom_support@lexarmedia.com</a>.</p>
