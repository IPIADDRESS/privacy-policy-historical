<h2><strong>We collect limited information.</strong></h2>

<p><em>Standard Log Files.</em> When you visit privacychoice.org or use our services through other sites, our servers log typical technical information, such as the numerical Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; and the Internet address of the website from which you followed a link to our site. This information is kept by our hosting provider, and we only access it in aggregate form via an analytics application.</p>

<p><em>Cookies.</em> We don't use beacons or set tracking cookies to associate your activities across different websites. We only retain your email address if you provide it with your permission, and we do not use them to send unsolicited email. When you opt-out of any tracking through privacychoice, we set a cookie that remembers your opt-out preferences for when you return to our site or see PrivacyChoice services on another website, and our browser add-on uses this cookie to preserve the appropriate opt-out cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, and use a number of free tools and browser add-ons if you wish to keep your IP number and other technical information anonymous.</p>

<p><em>Analytics.</em>To understand aggregate usage patterns, we use an open source site analytics system, <a href="http://piwik.org/" target="_blank">Piwik</a>, which we operate on our own servers. This system writes and reads cookies to identify return visitors. Because we host the service, no third party has access to this usage information, which we do not share. If you see Piwik appear on our site through tools like Ghostery, that does not mean that Piwik is receiving or has access to any information about your use of this site.</p>

<p>We also use Google Analytics, which Google provides as a free service. Although Google processes and stores usage information about the use of this site (all the same information described above), it does so strictly as our agent. Based on options we have selected, Google's policy is to refrain from any other use or sharing of this information. Read <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">Google's policy</a>. Visit <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">this page</a> to opt out of data collection by Google Analytics.</p>

<p><em>Registration Information.</em> If you sign up for site scanning, privacy widget or seal services, we may ask for your name, title, email address, city, state, postal code, country of residence, and phone number, and we may invite you to select a password. We never associate any of your personally identifiable information with information about your activities through our services.</p>

<p><em>Information Collected Through TrackerScan.</em> When you use the TrackerScan add-on or bookmark or view a PrivacyWidget on a third-party website, that action submits the list of tracking companies on the page that you are viewing in order to provide the tracking company information you have requested for that page or website. We also use this information (only in aggregate) to maintain our database as to which tracking companies are generally present on individual websites. However, individual pages you may view are never collected across websites, nor are they associated with any anonymous or personally identifiable information you may otherwise provide to us.</p>

<p><em>Third-Party Data Collection</em> We may link to third parties, such as UserVoice (<a href="http://uservoice.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>), and these parties may use cookies or other tracking method under their own privacy policies, but they have agreed not to use or share the information for other purposes.</p>

<a name="use"></a>
<h2><strong>We only use your information to provide the services that you request.</strong></h2>

<p>If you use a PrivacyChoice service that requires registration, we use the information you provide solely to process and fulfill the services we provide. If you have provided your email address, we will use your email address to send you updates and alerts about our services.</p>

<a name="sharing"></a>
<h2><strong>We don't share information with other parties for their own purposes.</strong></h2>
<p>We do not convey any information about your use of this service to any other party for their use, other than for their use solely in providing services to us.</p>
<p>We may publish reports with aggregate information, such as trends in the interests of PrivacyChoice users. This never includes information about any individual user.</p>

<p>To operate the service, we also need to make your information available to third parties in these limited circumstances: (1) with your express consent, (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, (3) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to protect our rights or property, or (4) to any successor in a merger or acquisition. From time to time, we may work with consultants or other third parties who may have access to information about our users, including contact information. We restrict their use of any information in accordance with their assigned tasks and subject to all of the limitations of this policy.</p>

<a name="control"></a>
<h2><strong>You are in control of your information.</strong></h2>

<p>You may choose to correct, update, or delete the membership information you have submitted to us by sending an email requesting changes to privacy@privacychoice.org. You may unsubscribe from email communications by clicking on a link in the bottom of each email you may receive from us.</p>

<a name="secure"></a>
<h2><strong>We take steps to keep your information secure.</strong></h2>

<p>We and our data hosts employ security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to store information in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>

<a name="keep"></a>
<h2><strong>We only keep information for a limited time.</strong></h2>
<p>We maintain information collected for no more than one year after your last interaction with our service or the termination of your membership.</p>

<a name="california"></a>
<h2><strong>You have additional privacy rights under California law.</strong></h2>

<p>Residents of California have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship the following: (i) a list of the categories of personal information (e.g., name, address, e-mail address, and the type of services provided to the customer) that a business has disclosed to third parties, during the immediately preceding calendar year, for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, and (ii) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above information, please e-mail us at: privacy@privacychoice.org, or write to us at PrivacyChoice, 101 Cooper Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95060, with a reference to California Disclosure Information. We will respond to such written requests promptly.</p>

<a name="changes"></a>
<h2><strong>We will let you know if this policy changes in a substantive way.</strong></h2>

<p>Our privacy policy may change from time to time. If we make any substantive changes to our policies, we will place a notice on privacychoice.org and send an email to registered users.</p>
