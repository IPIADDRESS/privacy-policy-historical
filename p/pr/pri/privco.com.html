<p><b>Disabling cookies</b></p>
<p>You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” facility). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.</p>
<p>Further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com.uk/">www.youronlinechoices.com.uk</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Site/Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Site/Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. PIXEL TAGS</b></p>
<p>We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Site/Services to track the actions of users on our Site/Services. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Site/Services, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our usersâ€™ personal data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</b></p>
<p>Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to do not track signals. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com/">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>with your consent, to send you marketing e-mails about upcoming promotions, and other news, including information about products and services offered by us and our affiliates. You may opt-out of receiving such information at any time: such marketing emails tell you how to “opt-out.” Please note, even if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about your account with us (if you have one) and our business dealings with you;</li>
<li>as we believe necessary or appropriate (a) to comply with applicable laws; (b) to comply with lawful requests and legal process, including to respond to requests from public and government authorities; (c) to enforce our Policy; and (d) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of you or others; and</li>
<li>as described in the “Sharing of your Personal Data” section below.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>7. Sharing Your Personal Data</b></p>
<p>We may share your personal data as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Third Parties Designated by You.</b>&nbsp;We may share your personal data with third parties where you have provided your consent to do so.</li>
<li><b>Our</b>&nbsp;<b>Third Party Service Providers</b>. We may share your personal data with our third party service providers who provide services such as data analysis, payment processing, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, auditing and other similar services. These third parties are only permitted to use your personal data to the extent necessary to enable them to provide their services to us. They are required to follow our express instructions and to comply with appropriate security measures to protect your personal data.</li>
<li><b>Affiliates</b>. We may share some or all of your personal data with our affiliates, in which case we will require our affiliates to comply with this Policy. In particular, you may let us share personal data with our affiliates where you wish to receive marketing communications from them.</li>
<li><b>Corporate Restructuring.</b>&nbsp;We may share personal data when we do a business deal, or negotiate a business deal, involving the sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets.

<p><b>8. Anonymous Data</b></p>
<p>When we use the term “anonymous data,” we are referring to data and information that does not permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third party.</p>
<p>We may create anonymous data from the personal data we receive about you and other individuals whose personal data we collect. Anonymous data might include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies. We make personal data into anonymous data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this anonymous data to analyses usage patterns in order to make improvements to our Site/Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9. User Generated Content</b></p>

<p><b>10. International Data Transfer</b></p>
<p>Your information, including personal data that we collect from you, may be transferred to, stored at and processed by us outside the country in which you reside, including, but not limited to the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. By using our Site/Services, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>11. Security</b></p>
<p>We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal data within our organization. Unfortunately, no transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us using the details in Section 20 below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>12. Retention</b></p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data as long reasonably required for you to use the Site and/or to provide you with the Services unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example for regulatory purposes).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>13. Our Policy on Children</b></p>
<p>Our Site/Services are not directed to children under 16. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us using the details in Section 20 below.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>14. Sensitive Personal Data</b></p>
<p>Subject to the following paragraph, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal data (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Site/Services or otherwise to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Opt-out.&nbsp;</b>You may contact us anytime to opt-out of: (i) direct marketing communications; (ii) any new processing of your personal data that we may carry out beyond the original purpose; or (iii) the transfer of your personal data outside the EEA. Please note that your use of some of the Site/Services may be ineffective upon opt-out.</li>
<li><b>Access.&nbsp;</b>You may access the information we hold about you at any time via your account or by contacting us directly.</li>
<li><b>Amend.&nbsp;</b>You can also contact us to update or correct any inaccuracies in your personal data.</li>
<li><b>Move.&nbsp;</b>Your personal data is portable â€“ i.e. you to have the flexibility to move your data to other service providers as you wish.</li>
<li><b>Erase and forget.&nbsp;</b>In certain situations, for example when the information we hold about you is no longer relevant or is incorrect, you can request that we erase your data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details in Section 17 below. In your request, please make clear: (i)&nbsp;<b>what</b>&nbsp;personal data is concerned; and (ii)&nbsp;<b>which of the above rights</b>&nbsp;you would like to enforce.
