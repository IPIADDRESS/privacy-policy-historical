Under applicable law, we may share Other Information with other parties who already possess your Personal Information in order to enhance their records about you or enhance their ability to provide products and services.</li>

<p>Some of the Services may include websites that Prime Publishing operates on behalf of third parties (<b>âLicensorsâ</b>).  Where applicable, we may share some or all of your Personal Information with the Licensor; however this privacy policy does not cover the user of your Personal Information by a Licensor.

We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.</p>
<p>We may also sell or transfer Online Data to certain third parties such as advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests, and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of this information. Some of these third parties may combine the Online Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.</p>
<p>We may engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. These third party providers may collect User Information from our Services for their own purposes, including but not limited to monitoring fraud around the web.</p>
<p>We may also engage third parties for the purpose of recognizing our users and delivering interest-based content and advertisements to them. We may share your User Information with our partners such as your name, postal address, email, or other identifier. Our partners may also: (i) collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID, advertising ID, and information about your browser or operating system; (ii) combine User Information about you received from Prime Publishing with information about you from other sites or services; and (iii) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</p>

<p><strong>RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA USERS WITH REGARD TO THEIR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>California users have several rights regarding the collection, use, disclosure and sale of their information under the CCPA.  One of these rights, notice of collection of Information, is described above; the balance of these rights are described below and include the following rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disclosure of information collected and sold</li>
<li>Opt-out from the sale of Information</li>
<li>Deletion of Information</li>
<li>Access and portability of Information collected</li>
<li>Non-discrimination</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercising Your Rights, Verification and Timing.</strong></p>
<p>To request Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold, Right to Opt-Out and/or Deletion of Information or to exercise any other data rights under California law, please contact us using one of the following methods:</p>
<p><u>Website</u>: You may visit our Contact Us page and submit a request at <a href="https://www.primecp.com/contact-us/">https://www.primecp.com/contact-us/</a></p>
<p><u>Email</u>: You may write to us to exercise rights. Please include your full name and email address, along with why you are writing, so that we can process your request in an efficient manner and email us at <a href="mailto:caprivacy@primecp.com">caprivacy@primecp.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Response Timing and Format.</strong> We aim to respond to a consumer request for access or deletion within 45 days of receiving that request. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
<p>To prevent an unauthorized third party from accessing or making decisions regarding a userâs Information, we verify all requests to exercise these rights (a verifiable consumer request). We do not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or abusive. We WILL require you to verify the requestorâs identity. This may include furnishing a notarized and signed attestation along with proof of identity (i.e. driverâs license, passport, state ID). A notary will identify the person appearing before the notary through personal acquaintance or by reference to significant proofs of identity such as passport, driving license, etc. Original documents must be mailed, faxed or uploaded via details we will provide in response to any access related inquiry.</p>
<p>In general, we will verify a request by matching the identifying information supplied by the user with the Information we already have for the user.  If we cannot verify the user using the foregoing method, we may request additional information which we will not retain or use for any other purpose.</p>
<p>For all verifiable consumer requests, we strive to respond within forty-five (45) days of receipt.  If we require additional time, which can be up to ninety (90) days in the aggregate, we will provide written notice.  Any disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer requestâs receipt and will be delivered electronically in a secure fashion.  If, for some reason, we cannot fulfill or comply with your request, our response will explain that decision.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold.</strong> While users have the right to request different levels of disclosure regarding the collection, use, disclosure and sale of Information, we have elected to treat all requests from California residents as an exercise of expanded disclosure requests by businesses that sell Information.  Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you for the 12 months prior to your request:</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories and sources of Information collected;</li>
<li>Our business and commercial purposes for collecting and selling that Information;</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we shared that Information;</li>
<li>The specific pieces of Information collected;</li>
<li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, we will disclose:</li>
<li>For sales â the Information categories for each category sold and the categories of third parties to whom the Information was sold; and</li>
<li>For disclosures â the Information categories for each category disclosed and the categories of third parties to whom the Information was disclosed</li>
</ul>
<p>To request Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold or to exercise any other data rights under California law, please contact us using one of the following methods:</p>
<p><u>Website</u>: You may visit our Contact Us page and submit a request at <a href="https://www.primecp.com/contact-us/">https://www.primecp.com/contact-us/</a></p>
<p><u>Email</u>: You may write to us to exercise rights. Please include your full name and email address, along with why you are writing, so that we can process your request in an efficient manner and email us at <a href="mailto:caprivacy@primecp.com">caprivacy@primecp.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Opt-Out.</strong> Users have the right to opt-out from the sale of their Information.  We reserve the right to verify all opt-out requests using the methods described above.</p>
<p>While our agreements with third parties to whom we sell or disclose Information prohibit the further sale or use beyond the scope of our agreement with them, if a California user opts-out, we will notify all third parties to whom we have sold or disclosed the California userâs Information within the previous 90 days and remind them not to further sell the Information.  We will not ask a California user who has opted out to re-opt-in for one year after the California user opts-out.  If the user requests a transaction with us that requires the sale of their Information, we will inform them that they have opted out and if they want to proceed with the transaction, we will offer the opportunity to opt-in by completing a two-step process.</p>
<p>To request Right to Opt-Out or to exercise any other data rights under California law, please contact us using one of the following methods:</p>
<p><u>Website</u>: You may visit our Contact Us page and submit a request at <a href="https://www.primecp.com/contact-us/">https://www.primecp.com/contact-us/</a></p>
<p><u>Email</u>: You may write to us to exercise rights. Please include your full name and email address, along with why you are writing, so that we can process your request in an efficient manner and email us at <a href="mailto:caprivacy@primecp.com">caprivacy@primecp.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Deletion of Information.</strong> You have the right to request that we delete any of your Information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.  Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request using the process set forth above, we will delete or deidentify (and direct our service providers, vendors and other applicable third parties to delete) your Information from our system other than from our archive servers (which we maintain for compliance purposes), unless there is an applicable exception.</p>
<p>We may decline to process your deletion request if the Information is necessary for us or our service providers, vendors or other applicable third parties for a number of reasons.  The following are some of the reasons we may decline your deletion request:</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the Information or provide the goods or services you requested;</li>
<li>Detect security incidents, protect, investigate and respond to malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;</li>
<li>Identify and correct errors that negatively impact intended functionality; and</li>
<li>Comply with a legal obligation, including Federal and/or State tax liability and reporting.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we do not comply with a deletion request, we will provide the grounds for our denial.</p>
<p>To request Deletion of Information or to exercise any other data rights under California law, please contact us using one of the following methods:</p>
<p><u>Website</u>: You may visit our Contact Us page and submit a request at <a href="https://www.primecp.com/contact-us/">https://www.primecp.com/contact-us/</a></p>
<p><u>Email</u>: You may write to us to exercise rights. Please include your full name and email address, along with why you are writing, so that we can process your request in an efficient manner and email us at <a href="mailto:caprivacy@primecp.com">caprivacy@primecp.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Access and Portability.</strong> California users have the right to access the Information we have collected about them in the previous twelve (12) months.  Upon receipt of verified consumer request, we will provide the information in a readily usable format.  You cannot request access more than twice in any 12-month period.</p>
<p><strong>Nondiscrimination.</strong> We are committed not to discriminate against California users who exercise their CCPA rights.  As such, unless otherwise permitted by the CCPA, we will not deny,  charge you different prices or rates, or provide a different quality level of  goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties, and/or suggest that you may receive a different price, rate, or quality level of goods or services.  While we do not provide financial incentives for users who do not exercise their CCPA rights, please note that some of the functionality of our Website may be unavailable if consumers exercise their rights to have their personal information deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Authorized Agent.</strong> The CCPA enables California users to appoint an authorized agent to act on their behalf to submit disclosure requests and or deletion requests under the CCPA.  The authorized agent must register with the California Secretary of State.  We will honor a request from an authorized agent provided you provide written authorization to the authorized agent to act on your behalf and we can verify your identity and the agent submits proof of authorization.</p>
<p><strong>CCPA Metrics.</strong> We are required to compile certain annual metrics regarding the CPPA including the number of disclosures, deletion and opt-out requests we receive, the median number of days it takes us to respond and how many of each were denied.  We will provide this information starting in 2021 by posting a link in this Policy.</p>
