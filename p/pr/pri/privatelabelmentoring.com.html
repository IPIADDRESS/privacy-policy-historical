                  The hosting provider for this Internet site (as with any Internet 
                  site) has the ability to record various information, including 
                  domain name, pages accessed, date and time of access, web browser 
                  type and computer operating system, and referring information, 
                  and to disclose this information. This is most commonly done 
                  by providing access to raw server logs. For more information 
                  you should perform an Internet search on 'server logs' or 'raw 
                  server logs.' We may have access to our raw server logs and 
                  access reports prepared by our hosting provider.

                  We sell products and services. When sales are made financial 
                  information must be disclosed. This information can include 
                  any number of facts you are asked to provide, but most commonly 
                  includes your name, financial / credit card information, billing 
                  address, and email address. Generally, this purchase information 
                  will be provided by you to a third party payment processor and 
                  we do not receive your financial / credit card information.

                  <br>
                  In the event we do receive financial / credit card information, 
                  we will not disclose it to anyone unless disclosure is required 
                  by law or a court order, or unless disclosure is required to 
                  address an issue implicated by the financial transaction. If 
                  you claim that your financial information was used to make a 
                  purchase you did not authorize, details about the financial 
                  transaction may be disclosed to law enforcement and anyone else 
                  we deem necessary to address the matter.
