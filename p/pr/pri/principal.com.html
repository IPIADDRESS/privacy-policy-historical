</p><p><a name="how"><b>How The Information Is Secured</b></a>

</p><p>The information for the accounts you have with The Principal Financial Group is kept secure and confidential through multiple security features and procedures.
</p><ul>
<li>The information you request from our website for your accounts can only be 	accessed with your personal identification number (PIN).  It is your  	responsibility to keep your PIN confidential.  
<ul>	
	<li>	Do not disclose your PIN to anyone.  Our employees and associates will 			never ask you for your PIN.
	</li><li>	Never write your PIN on something others may see.	
  	</li><li>	Contact us immediately to change your PIN if you suspect someone has 			discovered it.
</li></ul>
</li><li>	Information you submit through our website, as well as the information we 	send back to you while you are visiting our website, is protected while passing 	through the Internet using strong encryption ("scrambling" to make it	incomprehensible) when necessary. 	Our <a href="#ssl">secure server software</a> encrypts 	information, ensuring that Internet communications through our website stay private and protected.
</li><li>	Your account information is not permanently stored on our Web server.  The 	information only resides on our Web server while you are viewing the 	information.  It is permanently stored on our secured corporate computer 	systems. 
</li><li>	Our corporate network systems which store your account information use 	proven security controls.
</li><li>	We have data security staff whose sole responsibilities are to ensure the security 	of the information we process and store.
</li><li>	The Principal Financial Group has policies and procedures in place to limit 	access to your information to only those who have a business need to view it.
</li></ul> 
<p><a name="msgs"><b>Electronic Message and Email Security</b></a>

</p><p>Messages traveling through the Internet using email processes are subject to viewing, alteration, and copying by potentially anyone on the Internet.  We encourage customers to send confidential correspondence through either the postal service, or by using the telephone to speak directly to our employees.  We are not responsible for the security or confidentiality of communications you send to us through the Internet using the email process. 

</p><p>If you want to opt-out of solicitations, you may use our <a href="https://www.principal.com/general/optout.shtml">opt-out reply form</a>.  Messages generated through this form will reach us via an encrypted communications link established through our web server and the browser systems, not through an actual email process.

</p><p><a name="ssl"><b>Secure Server Software</b></a>

</p><p>To ensure the security of your confidential account information, we use proven security software to encrypt the information before it is transmitted through the Internet.  We only allow confidential information to be submitted for transmission if your browser is compatible with our security software.  If your browser is not compatible, you will receive a message indicating your transaction can not be completed because of the security risk.
