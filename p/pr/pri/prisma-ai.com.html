      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>You can see our previous Privacy Policy <a href="/privacy-june-2016.html">here</a></p>
      <p>Effective date: May 30, 2018</p>
      <p>Welcome to Prisma (“Prisma,” “we,” “us” or “our”). Prisma provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for you to stylize your photo. Just snap a photo, choose a style to transform the look and feel, and share!</p>
      <p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Prisma services (collectively, the “Service”), and your choices about the collection and use of your information. We undertake to build the Service and any of its features in such a way that it respects your privacy and allow you not only to understand what we do with your personal information, but also manage your data effectively.</p>
      <p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to stylize content.</p>
      <p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).</p>

      <h3>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
      <p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
      <p><strong>Information you provide us directly.</strong> If you are unregistered user we collect User Content (including your photos and materials with applied styles) that you post through the Service.</p>
      <p><strong>Analytics information.</strong> We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies.</strong> When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Prisma and provide features to you.</p>
      <p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
      <p><strong>Log file information.</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
      <p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
      <p><strong>Device identifiers.</strong> When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Prisma.</p>
      <p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>

        <li>Push Token (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Metadata.</strong> Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</p>
      <p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you share a photo) or other data.</p>
      <p><strong>Registered users.</strong> If you are registered user we may collect more Personal Data about you including the following:</p>

      <p>If the information covered by this Section is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, we may use it for any business purpose. To the extent information covered by this Section is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection laws, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Personal Data.” We use pseudonymization for particular types of Personal Data to ensure better security of your Personal Data. Please bear in mind that provisions of Section 3 do not apply to pseudonymized Personal Data.</p>

      <p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your Personal Data</strong>. We may share User Content and your Personal Data (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Prisma is part of, or that become part of that group (“Affiliates”). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates’ own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your photos and are bound by the rules of this Privacy Policy.</p>

This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.

We use reasonable and appropriate information security safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. However, Prisma cannot ensure the absolute security of any information you transmit to the Service or an absolute guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Please understand that there is no ideal technology or measure to maintain 100 % security. Among others, we utilize the following information security measures:</p>

You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Prisma, at all times.

We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any other organization.</p>
