	<em>Updated May 25, 2018</em></p>

<p>
	Prager University is a not-for-profit foundation based in the United States of America. &nbsp;Prager University and its affiliated programs have created this Privacy Policy to explain why we collect particular information, what information we collect, how we process the information we collect, and how we will protect your personal privacy. The following policy also discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for websites and/or mobile applications we operate at PragerU.com, PragerU.org, PragerUniversity.com, PragerPedia.com, PragerPedia Mobile App, Freetothink.com, PragerUMyShopify.com and elsewhere. The term “Websites” will be used to refer to these and other websites owned and maintained by Prager University.</p>

<p>
	In order to fully understand your rights we encourage you to read this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use. Prager University and its affiliated programs reserve the right at any time and without notice to change this Privacy Policy simply by posting such changes on our Websites. Any such change will be effective immediately upon posting.</p>

<p>
	At Prager University, we are committed to protecting your privacy. You can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request.</p>

<p>
	This Website Privacy Policy (“Policy”) provides you with information concerning our practices and procedures as they relate specifically to information we collect at this website. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, this Privacy Policy notifies you of:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		What personally identifiable information of yours is collected through the Site;</li>
	<li>
		Who collects such information;</li>
	<li>
		How such information is used;</li>
	<li>
		With whom your information may be shared;</li>
	<li>
		What choices you have regarding collection, use and distribution of your information;</li>
	<li>
		What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control;</li>
	<li>
		How you can correct any inaccuracies in your information.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Questions regarding this statement should be directed to Prager University and its affiliated programs by sending an email to info@prageru.com. Please reference this Privacy Policy in your subject line.</p>

<p>
	<strong>What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information:</strong></p>

<p>
	Our registration, donation, and product ordering forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, format preference (HTML vs. Text), address, interests, donation and payment amounts, and similar information. &nbsp;We do not request or store sensitive information from our visitors, such as credit card or social security numbers.</p>

<p>
	We use the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide information for a certain reason, we may use the information in connection with the reason for which it was provided and we may also email you about other content, advertisements, promotions and products. For instance, if you sign up for PragerU updates, we will use the information to send you updates on new content, events and products. Additionally, if you sign a petition, enter a contest or respond to a survey you will be added to our email list where you will receive other updates from PragerU. &nbsp;<br>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	We generally retain personal data for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes identified herein. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Data may persist in copies made for backup and mission continuity purposes for additional time.</p>

<p>
	Prager University and Prager University Agents use email addresses and mailing addresses to send updates about various content offerings and program activities. To exclude yourself from any of these mailings, electronic or postal, please contact us at info@prageru.com. You may also opt out of electronic mailings by clicking the unsubscribe link included in each mailing, and you may modify what types of electronic mailings you receive by clicking on the “update profile” link in each mailing.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Agent</strong></p>

<p>
	An “Agent” is any third party that collects or uses personal information under the instructions of, and solely for, Prager University, or a third party to which Prager University discloses personal information for use on Prager University behalf. &nbsp;Agents shall comply with the privacy obligations stated in this Policy.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Transfer of Information to the United States</strong></p>

<p>
	The Site is operated in the United States and is intended for users located in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including personal information, may be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States. By using the Site or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the United States. You are also consenting to the application of United States federal law in all matters concerning the Site and this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Information About Children</strong></p>

<p>
	We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Sharing Information with Third Parties:</strong></p>

<p>
	We do not sell or share the mailing or email addresses of our site-users or constituents with any other organization, unless that information is gathered for a co-sponsored event for which we are handling registration. In that case, your contact information may be shared with co-sponsoring organizations for purposes related to the event for which you registered. However, such co-sponsoring organizations will not be authorized to add you to their regular communications lists unless you specifically opt-in to be added to those lists during the registration or survey process. If the user does opt-in during the registration or survey process, their information will be shared and can only be deleted by calling the co-sponsoring organization directly.</p>

<p>
	On occasion we will send out an email to our constituents on behalf of another organization. We do not share or sell any constituent information to that organization. &nbsp;Users who respond to any links contained in those emails may have their information collected by that organization.<br>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	We contract with companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, typically sending postal mail or shipping products. These third parties use constituent information only to fulfill the task we have hired them to perform and do not store the information.<br>

<p>
	<strong>Website Analytics:</strong></p>

<p>

<p>
	<strong>Security:</strong></p>

<p>
	All information provided to Prager University and its affiliated programs is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on secure portions of our Websites that are only accessible by certain qualified employees of Prager University and its affiliated programs. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.</p>

<p>
	All online donations and other financial transactions are completed through Paypal and Classy.org. &nbsp;We encourage you to click on the links to learn more about their privacy policies.</p>

	Classy Inc. and PayPal powered pages are PCI DSS compliant. PCI DSS is the payment card industry security requirement for entities that store, process or transmit cardholder data, and has been endorsed by all the major card brands — Visa Inc., MasterCard Worldwide, Discover Network, American Express and JCB. PCI DSS compliance gives consumers the confidence they need to know that organizations accepting electronic payments or donations are doing so in a verified, secure, and consistent fashion.</p>

<p>
	We use a Constituent Relationship Manager (CRM) called Razer’s Edge, a product of Blackbaud to manage our constituent base. We never store any financial information on our CRM.
