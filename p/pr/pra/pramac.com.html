Some areas of the Sites offer the chance to interact with other users and with PR INDUSTRIAL staff and experts, so that the sharing of information and news related to PR Industrial products and associated technologies are promoted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>2. Processing Arrangements</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>3. Optional Data Provision</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4. Use of Data</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><em>of the purposes and methods of the processing;</em></li>

<h3>7. Protection of personal information</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PR INDUSTRIAL is committed to protect unconditionally the privacy of personal information. The various used technologies and procedures of protection are finalized to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosing. For instance, personal information is stored on computer systems with limited access, placed in controlled structures. Moreover, when highly reserved personal data are transmitted on the Internet (like credit card number), they are protected through cryptography, e.g. with SSL protocol (Secure Sockets Layer).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>8. Cookies</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sites use cookies for assuring the integrity of the registration procedure and for customizing the Sites. A cookie is a small sized text file saved in the hard disk of the user from a web page. Cookies cannot be used for executing programs or sending viruses to the computer of the user. Cookies are assigned to the user in a univocal way and can be only read by the Web server of the domain, which sent them.</p>

<p>One of the main purposes of cookies is to make the user save time. For instance, if you customize a Web page or visit a website, a cookie will allow the visited site to recall specific information about the user in the following visits. The use of cookies allows providing the user with customized contents and simplifies the visit of the websites. At the following visit to the website, the previously provided information may be retrieved thus simplifying the use of customized features for the user.</p>

<p>For the sending of cookies in PR INDUSTRIAL website, a Web technology based on beaconing, also known as "clear gif" or action tag technology may be used. Such technology allows PR INDUSTRIAL to compile aggregated statistics related to the use of the Sites, like for instance the links or the pictures. PR INDUSTRIAL can provide its own partners with aggregated statistical data.</p>

<p>User can accept or refuse cookies. Most of Web browsers automatically accept cookies. Anyway, the user can change the browser settings so that cookies are refused. If you decide to refuse cookies, it is possible that interactive features offered by the websites could not be used anymore.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>9. Use of Web Beacons</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sites may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, sometimes named as "pixel gif", which allow PR INDUSTRIAL to count the number of users who visited those pages and to offer services, also in collaboration with other companies. The Sites may include Web beacon in e-mail messages or promotional newsletter for detecting whether the messages have been opened or the users performed any action after receiving them.<br>
Some Web beacons can be put by service providers of third parties for allowing detecting the efficacy of our advertising campaigns or of the e-mail communications. Such Web beacon may be used by user providers for putting a persistent cookie in the user's computer. That allows the service provider to recognize the computer every time the user visits certain Web pages or e-mail messages and compile anonymous information related to viewing these pages. PR INDUSTRIAL forbids the use of Web beacon targeted to the access or collection of personal information of the user.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>10. Changes to this informative report about privacy</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PR INDUSTRIAL will be able to update, occasionally, this informative report about privacy. In these cases, the date at the beginning of the informative report will be changed, at the "latest update" item. In case of substantial changes in the contents of the informative report, PR INDUSTRIAL will inform the customers by publishing notices related to it in the homepage of the Sites, in alternative, by directly sending notices to the users. PR INDUSTRIAL suggests reading periodically this informative report about privacy so that you can always be up-to-dated about the initiatives performed by PR INDUSTRIAL for protecting the privacy of collected personal information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>11. Data Controller</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
