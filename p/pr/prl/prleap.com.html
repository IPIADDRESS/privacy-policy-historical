	<h1>PR LEAP Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>PRLeap.com is the website of Condesa.</p>

<p>We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of this website, located at www.prleap.com ("Site" or "Service").This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason; each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>

<p>PR Leap is a newswire service which distributes press releases on behalf of our users. If you submit a press release for distribution through our system, we will transmit your entire press release including any personal information therein contained to our media contacts and online distribution points including search engines.</p>

<p>By using our Site you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States. If you reside outside the U.S. your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By visiting our Site and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the US.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>Any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us via our help desk here: <a href="http://www.prleap.com/contact_us">http://www.prleap.com/contact_us</a></p>


<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>We do not share user information with any third parties other than via press release distribution as described above.</p>

<p>Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.</p>

<strong>Information Collected Upon Registration.</strong>

<p>If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to PR Leap. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your IP address, full user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with.</p>

<strong>Use of Contact Information</strong>

<p>In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Service.
