</p><p><b>WHAT ARE COOKIES? WHY DO WE USE THEM?</b>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cookies are small files stored by your browser in your computer when you visit our Site. We use cookies to improve our Site and make it easier to use. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. We mostly use "session cookies" that are automatically deleted after each visit. Cookies from our Site can't be read by other sites. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change browser settings to refuse them.

</p><p>
</p><p><b>HOW DO WE PROTECT INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</b>
</p><p>
</p><p>We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.
</p><p>
</p><p><b>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP USER INFORMATION?</b>
</p><p>
</p><p>We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for about one hundred eighty (180) days. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely.

</p><p>Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have greater control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.
</p><p>
</p><p><b>YOUR CONSENT TO THIS POLICY</b>
</p><p>
</p><p>By using our Site, you agree to this Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. Our Terms of Service take precedence over any conflicting Policy provision. We may change our Policy by posting a new version on our Site.
