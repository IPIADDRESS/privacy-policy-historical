        Online Privacy Policy</font> </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">At Provident, we are responsive to our customers’ 
        needs. <br>
        <br>
        One way to achieve this is to obtain customer information in order to 
        provide superior quality products and service to best meet their needs. 
        Our customers’ needs are important to us. However, we are also aware 
        of the customer’s expectation of privacy, including the personal 
        information that you provide to us on-line. Protecting this information 
        is something we take very seriously. Therefore, whenever we handle a customer’s 
        personal information, we adhere to the following policy:</font> </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2">We keep information accurate, secure, and confidential. We share personal
        customer information only with our subsidiaries, from time to time, in accordance with
        both legal and confidential policies.</font> </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2">All Bank employees adhere to these confidentiality standards.</font> </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2">We do not share personal information with third parties except if one or
        more of the following occurred: (1) where the customer consents to disclosure; (2) where
        we are legally required to do so; (3) where we have consented to provide customer
        information by contract; and (4) where the customer has been informed about the Bank
        sharing of information and the customer has been given the opportunity to decline.</font> </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><font size="2">Customers may notify us if they believe that any of 
          their personal information is inaccurate. We can be contacted at 1-800-962-9644 
          or within the Baltimore area, 410-281-7111 or email us at feedback@provbank.com 
          and we will gladly accommodate your request.</font> </li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">Information regarding our customers is used in the normal course of our
    business in order to deliver premium customer service and to offer products tailored to
    the customers’ needs. As our technologies and resources change, we will continue to
    evaluate and modify, as necessary, our policies on safeguarding customer information.</font></p>
