        Bank's Customer Privacy Policy</b></font> </p>
      <p align="left">At Provident Bank and its subsidiaries, our focus on each 
        customer relationship is responsiveness to your needs. We recognize that 
        you have chosen to do business with our company because we provide superior 
        quality products and service to meet your financial objectives. We also 
        recognize that you expect and trust the Bank to safeguard personal and 
        financial information. Protecting customer information and maintaining 
        the confidentiality and integrity of the information is something we take 
        very seriously. We believe that your privacy should be maintained. We 
        also want to offer you the array of financial products and services you 
        need to accomplish your financial goals. The Bank believes that we can 
        do both, as described in this privacy policy. </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Customer Information We Collect </b></p>
      <p align="left">Information about our customers comes from a variety of 
        sources. Some information is provided to the Bank directly by our customers. 
        Other information is developed by us as a function of providing a product 
        or service to our customers. Customer information is also obtained from 
        outside sources, e.g., credit bureaus. We will limit the collection of 
        information about our customers to that which is necessary to administer 
        our business, provide superior service, and offer opportunities that we 
        believe will be of interest to you. </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Use of Customer Information </b></p>
      <p align="left">The Bank will use and retain information about our customers 
        only for specific business and legal purposes - and we will tell you, 
        upon request, why we are collecting and retaining such information. This 
        means that we will use customer information to protect and administer 
        your records, accounts and funds; to comply with certain laws and regulations; 
        and to help us design and improve our products and service to you. </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Sharing Customer Information </b></p>
      <p align="left">From time to time, we share customer information with our 
        subsidiaries in accordance with the Bank's confidentiality policies and 
        this Customer Privacy Policy. We also share customer information under 
        the following circumstances: (1) where a customer consents to the disclosure; 
        (2) where we are legally required or allowed to do so; and (3) where it 
        is necessary to process or service your transaction with us. </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Security of Customer Information </b></p>
      <p align="left">We continually strive to keep customer information accurate, 
        secure, and confidential. We pledge to respond to your requests to correct 
        inaccurate information in a timely manner. The Bank's confidentiality 
        and business ethics policies provide, among other things, that all customer 
        information is considered private and privileged. Employee access to customer 
        information is limited to those individuals with a business reason to 
        know such information. The Bank's operational and data processing systems 
        are in a secure environment that prohibits customer account information 
        from being accessed by unauthorized third parties. </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Third Party Relationships </b></p>
      <p align="left">From time to time, the Bank may contract with third parties 
        to perform banking and customer service functions on the Bank's behalf. 
        When we provide customer information to such parties, the Bank requires 
        - generally through a written agreement - that the third parties adhere 
        to privacy principles similar to those to which Provident adheres for 
        keeping customer information confidential. We do not provide customer 
        information to unaffiliated companies for the purpose of independent telemarketing 
        or direct mail marketing of non - financial products or services. </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Medical Information </b></p>
      <p align="left">The Bank does not share medical or health information among 
        our family of companies, except to provide services that you have requested 
        or initiated. </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Provident Bank Commitment </b></p>
      <p align="left">Provident Bank and its employees value our customer relationships. 
        We want you to understand how we use the information you provide to us 
        and our commitment to ensuring your personal privacy. Customers who have 
        questions about this Customer Privacy Policy or have questions about the 
        privacy or accuracy of their customer information should call us at 1-800-962-9644 
        or within the Baltimore area, 410-281-7111, or e-mail us at feedback@provbank.com.

      <p align="center"><b>Simple Steps to Safeguard Your Identity </b></p>
      <p align="left">"Identity theft" involves the theft of an individual's personal 
        information. Those involved in identity theft typically assume an individual 
        's identity, apply for credit in his or her name, run up bills, do not 
        pay creditors and often damage the victim's credit record. </p>
      <p align="left">At Provident Bank, we have instituted a combination of safeguards 
        to protect customers. These safeguards include employee training, rigorous 
        security standards, data encryption and fraud detection. In addition, 
        you can also personally take these additional steps to deter identity 
        theft:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Do not give your Social Security or account numbers to anyone over 
          the telephone unless you initiated the call.</li>
        <li>Tear up receipts, old bank statements and unused credit card offers 
          before throwing them away. Such information can be retrieved from your 
          trash and used to obtain credit in your name. </li>
        <li>Review your bank and credit card statements as soon as you receive 
          them to check for unauthorized transactions. </li>
        <li>Protect your PINs and computer passwords, use a combination of letters 
          and numbers, and change them often. Never carry this information with 
          you! </li>
        <li>Order copies of your credit report once a year to ensure accuracy. 
          Call any of the three national credit reporting agencies: Trans Union 
          (800) 888-4213, Equifax (800) 685-1111, or Experian (888) 397-3742 to 
          request a copy of your report. </li>
        <li>Report any suspected fraud to your bank and credit account companies 
          immediately so that they can take appropriate steps to prevent or stop 
          identity theft. . </li>
      </ul>
