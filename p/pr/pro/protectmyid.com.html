              While information is the foundation for providing you with superior 
              service, protecting the privacy of your personal information is 
              of highest importance to us. We believe that responsible stewardship 
              of the information entrusted to us is crucial in developing and 
              maintaining the public trust essential for our continued success. 
              We are sensitive to your privacy concerns, and are committed to 
              letting you know what information is being collected on our websites, 
              how the information is being used and what choices you have regarding 
              the collection and use of the information. Please take a moment 
              to review this privacy policy and feel free to contact us with any 
              questions at <a href="mailto:privacy@consumerinfo.com">privacy@consumerinfo.com</a>. 
              <p><strong>WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</strong><br>
                The primary reason we collect personal and credit information 
                about you is to provide products and services that you have requested 
                and to enroll you into our membership services. The type of information 
                we collect, and the primary purpose for which it is collected 
                includes: 
              </p><ul>
                <li>Required product registration information such as name, address, 
                  social security number, and date-of-birth, is utilized to establish 
                  your membership or one-time transaction record and to verify 
                  your identity. We require this verification in order to provide 
                  you with your personal credit information.</li>
                <li>Credit information we receive from credit reporting agencies 
                  is utilized to provide you with the products and services we 
                  offer. </li>
                <li>Billing information, such as credit card number, is required 
                  to process the payment for the products and services you order 
                  from us.</li>
                <li>Other information we collect, such as city of birth and mother's 
                  maiden name, is used to verify your identity in the event you 
                  forget your login information required for our online services. 
                  E-mail addresses are collected and used to send you notifications, 
                  special offers and our latest e-newsletter via electronic mail.</li>
              </ul>
              We may disclose all of the information that we collect, as described 
              above. 
              <p><strong>DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?</strong><br>
                We may disclose any of the information that we collect to our 
                affiliated companies. <strong>We do not share information with 
                any non-affiliated third party</strong> except: (1) in select 
                circumstances when a business partner refers you to us and you 
                give us permission to share information with that business partner 
                on your order form, or (2) as permitted or required by law.<br>
                However, we may disclose all of the information we collect to 
                companies that perform services on our behalf such as the credit 
                reporting agencies from which we obtain your credit report(s), 
                credit card processors, e-mail communications management firms 
                or call center providers. When identifying methods of improving 
                our products and services or if we think a product may be of interest 
                to you, we may arrange to extend offers of goods or services to 
                you either directly or through our affiliates.<br>
                Our website may contain links for other offers and services that 
                we feel you may have an interest in. We believe these sites share 
                a similar commitment to consumer privacy and urge you to review 
                their privacy policy when visiting their sites. We cannot, however, 
                be responsible for their privacy practices.</p>
								
              <p><strong>OFFERING YOU CHOICES – MARKETING OPTIONS </strong><br>
                You have choices when it comes to learning about new offers or 
                services you can use to help meet your financial management goals. 
                If you do not wish to receive offers of products or services from 
                ConsumerInfo.com or its partners or affiliates, here are the methods 
                in which you can opt out: 
              </p><ul>
                1. <strong>New Order Opt-out Option:</strong> While placing an 
                order for the purchase of a credit report or monitoring service, 
                you may select to opt out of receiving special offers and newsletters 
                from us.<br>
                2. <strong>Customer Opt-out Options:</strong> Each e-mail we send 
                includes instructions and an opt-out link. Alternatively, you 
                may opt out by calling our Customer Care Center toll-free at 1-888-888-8553. 
                You may exercise this opt out choice at any time. 
              </ul>
              <p>While ordering a credit report, you may also have the option 
                of requesting "Your Offers.” If you sign up for "Your 
                Offers," ConsumerInfo.com will use the information in your 
                credit report to match your credit history to credit and financial 
                products and services you may be interested in, so that we can 
                provide you with information about such products and services 
                offered by our partners. These offers may be presented online 
                at ConsumerInfo.com or sent via e-mail, in our personalized monthly 
                newsletter and/or through occasional other e-mail contact. Anonymous, 
                aggregate information about customers who match a particular offer 
                may be provided to our partners, but no Personally Identifiable 
                Information about you will be shared with our partners unless 
                you respond to the offer and consequently provide it to them.</p>
              <p><strong>COOKIES AND THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS</strong><br>
                ConsumerInfo.com does not use cookies on its websites. Some of 
                our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, 
                advertisers). However, we have no control over these cookies or 
                access to the information contained in these cookies. <br>
                ConsumerInfo.com works with third parties to serve ads on our 
                websites. These ads may contain cookies and action tags (also 
                known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising 
                effectiveness and gather completely anonymous information. We 
                have no access to or control over these cookies or action tags 
                nor do we have access to the information they may gather.</p>
              <p><strong>WHAT IS OUR POLICY RELATING TO FORMER CUSTOMERS?</strong><br>
                Our policy regarding the collection and use of information about 
                former customers is the same as that regarding the collection 
                and use about existing customers (refer to section titled <strong>What 
                types of personal information do we collect about you?</strong>). 
                Over time, information about former customers is used less and 
                less and may ultimately be removed from our records.</p>
              <p><strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</strong><br>
                We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you 
                to those employees who need to know that information to provide 
                products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, 
                and procedural safeguards designed to protect your nonpublic personal 
                information.<br>
                ConsumerInfo.com protects your information over the Internet by 
                using a secure web server, which allows web browser programs (Netscape 
                or Microsoft Internet Explorer) to interact with ConsumerInfo.com's 
                web server via an encrypted session. ConsumerInfo.com employs 
                a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection that provides an encrypted 
                connection between your computer and ConsumerInfo.com. The 128 
                bit encrypted connection scrambles ordinary text or data into 
                cyphertext to safeguard sensitive information during its journey 
                across the Internet. The information is decrypted, or put back 
                into a readable format, when it reaches its intended destination. 
                Depending on which browser you use, you will know you are in secured 
                area by "https" or a lock appearing on your screen. 
                When you visit our website, you may move in and out of secured 
                areas. Any time that you are on an order page or viewing your 
                personal credit report, you will be in a secured area.</p>
              <p><strong>A SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OLD</strong><br>
                Consumers under the age of 13 must not send any personal information 
                to us—including but not limited to information such as name, 
                address or e-mail address. We do not knowingly collect personally 
                identifiable information from children under 13.</p>
              <p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</strong><br>
                We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time. 
                You agree to obtain annual notices of, and changes to, this privacy 
                policy electronically by visiting this website. Therefore, we 
                encourage you to review this privacy policy from time to time
