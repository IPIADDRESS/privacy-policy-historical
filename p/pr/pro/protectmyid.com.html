              <p><strong>WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</strong><br>
                The primary reason we collect personal and credit information

                <li>Required product registration information such as name, address, 
                  Social Security number, and date of birth, is utilized to establish 
                  your membership or one-time transaction record and to verify 
                  your identity. We require this verification in order to provide 
                  you with your personal credit information.</li>
                <li>Credit information we receive from credit reporting agencies 
                  is utilized to provide you with the products and services we 
                  offer.</li>
                <li>Billing information, such as credit card number, is required 
                  to process the payment for the products and services you order 
                  from us.</li>
                <li>Other information we collect, such as city of birth and mother's 
                  maiden name, is used to verify your identity in the event you 
                  forget your login information required for our online services. 
                  E-mail addresses are collected and used to send you notifications, 
                  special offers and our latest e-newsletter via electronic mail.</li>
              </ul>
              Corrections or updates to your information including your email 
              address, phone number, mailing address, credit card information 
              or password reminder phrase can be made through "My Credit 
              Center" in the section labeled "Account Tools." If 
              necessary, other corrections or updates to your information (such 
              as your name or Social Security number) can be made by contacting 
              a customer care representative at 1-888-888-8553. For your protection,

              <br>
              <br>
			  <strong>DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?</strong><br>
                <strong>We do not share information with any non-affiliated third 
                party</strong> except: (1) in select circumstances when a business 
                partner refers you to us and you give us permission to share specific 
                information, such as your name and email address, with that business 
                partner on your order form, or (2) as permitted or required by 
                law, such as inquires by law enforcement or to comply with Federal 
                laws such as the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography 
                and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act of 2003) or the Fair and 
                Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA).<br>
                If you choose, we may disclose the information that we collect 
                to our affiliated companies from time to time for marketing purposes 
                and to enhance our products and services to better suit your needs. 
                When identifying methods of improving our products and services 
                or if we think a product may be of interest to you, we may arrange 
                to extend select special offers of goods or services to you either 
                directly or through affiliates. If you would like to opt-out of 
                having your information shared with partners and/or affiliates, 
                please refer to the section labeled "Offering You Choices 
                - Marketing Options," below.<br>
                In order to provide the products you have requested, we may disclose 
                the information we collect to companies that perform services 
                on our behalf such as the credit reporting agencies from which 
                we obtain your credit report(s), credit card processors, e-mail 
                communications management firms or call center providers. Our 
                third party service providers are contractually limited to using 
                the information received from ConsumerInfo.com, Inc. solely for 
                the purposes of providing you with the services you requested.<br>
                Our Sites may contain links for other offers and services that 
                we feel you may have an interest in. We believe these sites share 
                a similar commitment to consumer privacy and urge you to review 
                their privacy policy when visiting their sites. We cannot, however, 
                be responsible for their privacy practices.
				
              <strong>OFFERING YOU CHOICES - MARKETING OPTIONS </strong><br>
                You have choices when it comes to learning about new offers or 
                services you can use to help meet your financial management goals. 
                If you do not wish to receive offers of products or services from 
                ConsumerInfo.com, Inc. or its partners or affiliates, here are 
                the methods in which you can opt out:
 			  <ul>
                1. <strong>New Order Opt-out Option:</strong> While placing an 
                order for the purchase of a credit report or monitoring service, 
                you may select to opt out of receiving special offers and newsletters 
                from us and our affiliated companies directly on your order form.<br>
                2. <strong>Email Opt-out Options:</strong> Each marketing e-mail 
                we send includes instructions and an opt-out link. Alternatively,

                at 1-888-888-8553. You may exercise this opt out choice at any 
                time.<br>
                3. <strong>Partner sharing Opt-out Options:</strong> If a business 
                partner refers you to our Site, you may choose not to have your 
                information shared with that partner by opting-out directly on 
                your order form.<br>
                4. <strong>Affiliate sharing Opt-out Options:</strong> While placing 
                an order for the purchase of a credit report or monitoring service, 
                you may select to opt-out of receiving offers from our affiliated 
                companies directly on your order form. 
              </ul>
              Please note that suppressed contact information will not be used 
                for any other purpose other to ensure compliance with your opt-out 
                request and to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and any other 
                applicable state and/or federal laws regarding your choices when 
                it comes to commercial email marketing.

                Like many websites, ConsumerInfo.com, Inc. may automatically track 
                information based upon your behavior on our Sites. We use this 
                information for research purposes to better understand, protect

              <strong>WHAT IS OUR POLICY RELATING TO FORMER CUSTOMERS?</strong><br>
                Our policy regarding the collection and use of information about 
                former customers is the same as that regarding the collection 
                and use about existing customers (refer to section titled <strong>What 
                types of personal information do we collect about you?</strong>). 
                Over time, information about former customers is used less and 
                less and may ultimately be removed from our records.
				<br><br>
              <strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</strong><br>
                We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you 
                to those of our employees who need to know that information in 
                order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, 
                electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect your 
                nonpublic personal information.<br>
                ConsumerInfo.com, Inc. protects your information over the Internet 
                by using a secure web server, which allows web browser programs 
                (Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer) to interact with our

                In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, 
                acquisition by another company, or sale of all or portion of our 
                assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be 
                among the assets transferred. You will be notified by means of 
                notice on our Sites for thirty (30) days of any such change in 
                ownership or control of your personal information. For more information, 
                please refer to the section labeled "Privacy Notice Changes,"
