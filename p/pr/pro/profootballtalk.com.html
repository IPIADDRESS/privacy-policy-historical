The following are details of the information FOOTBALL  TALK LLC collects: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Information.</strong> At some Football Talk LLC sites you can purchase  products, enter contests or sweepstakes, vote in polls or otherwise express an  opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as email newsletters and/or  participate in our online communities. In order for you to participate in these  activities Football Talk LLC may request and collect certain information and  data from you such as name, age, gender, address, email address, zip code,  telephone number, credit card information and information about your interests  in and use of various products, programs and services. By providing contact  information, you will be eligible to acquire user ID’s and passwords that will  allow you to play the fantasy games and to participate in the Football Talk LLC  community. </li>

For example, you might submit a person’s  email address to challenge them to a fantasy game or their name and address to  send a gift subscription. The types of personally identifiable information that  may be collected about other people may include: name, address and email  address. This information is not stored by Football Talk LLC and is not used  for any purpose other than for the purpose that the information is collected.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking.</strong> In the course of using the Football  Talk LLC site, Football Talk LLC may assign random numbers to you for the  purpose of anonymously tracking site usage. Information tracked includes, but  is not limited to, the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the Football  Talk LLC site or not), which URL you go to next (whether this URL is on the Football  Talk LLC site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. Many  sites automatically collect this information. This information is used for  purposes of system administration, diagnostics, site tracking and reporting of  aggregate usage information to third parties such as our advertisers and  content partners or for research purposes. Football Talk LLC does not link  information automatically collected to information identifying visitors  individually.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> Football Talk LLC may employ cookies  to recognize visitors and their privileges in order to provide visitors with  user specific information, as well as to track site usage. Cookies can also  help provide information that is targeted to visitors’ interests. Cookies are  stored on your browser, not on the Football Talk LLC site. You are free to  decline Football Talk LLC cookies if your browser permits, although in that  case you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a  session. Also, visitors who do not accept cookies may not be able to access  certain portions of the Football Talk LLC site. Cookies used by Football Talk  LLC are not tied to personally identifiable information and do not contain  personally identifiable information about a visitor, and FOOTBALL TALK LLC does  not use cookies to obtain such information. Cookies used by Football Talk LLC  are "session cookies," meaning that they can be automatically deleted  at the end of a session (technically when the user quits the browser).</li>

<li><strong>Advertisers and Sponsors.</strong> Football  Talk LLC sponsors and advertisers may use cookies within their advertisements  or promotions. Football Talk LLC will likely not have access to these cookies  or any information that they may contain. Visitors who want any information  about these cookies should contact the sponsors and advertisers directly. Once  you click on a sponsor link or advertisement and leave the Football Talk LLC  sites our privacy policy no longer applies. You must read the privacy policy of  the individual advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled  on their site. There may be times when we use third-party advertising companies  (the "Companies") to serve ads when you visit our site. These  Companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address  or telephone number) about your visits to our and other web sites in order to  provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In  addition, we may share web site usage information about visitors to our sites  with this these Companies for the purpose of managing and targeting  advertisements, for market research analysis on our site and other sites and  for tracking a specific activity on our site relating to the marketing efforts  of an advertiser. For these purposes, the Companies may note some of the pages  you visit on our site as well as some of the activities you undertake through  the use of Web Beacons and pixel tags (also called clear gifs). In the course  of serving advertisements to this site, the Companies may also place or recognize  a unique "cookie" on your computer. As is always the case,  information collected and used by these Companies will not be tied to a user’s  personal information and will only be used in the aggregate. If you want to  prevent a third-party advertiser from collecting data, currently you may visit  each ad network’s web site individually and opt-out or visit the NAI gateway  opt-out site to opt-out of all network-advertising cookies. This site will also  allow you to review the third party advertising companies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>II. What Football Talk LLC Does With the Information</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provide Services.</strong> Football Talk LLC asks  for information in connection with registration, promotions, email updates, and  prizes. Football Talk LLC may use this information to tailor online  presentations, facilitate navigation throughout sites operated by Football Talk  LLC, provide personalized services and promotions, or offer products and  services that Football Talk LLC believes might be of use or interest to you,  and to communicate separately with you. This information may be combined with  other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and  past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. This  information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient  and may also be used to bring you offers of interest.</li>

<li><strong>Third Parties.</strong> We do not sell  information about our visitors. Football Talk LLC will not transfer your  personal information to another party for that party’s exclusive use apart from  the use of the information by Football Talk LLC. However, if we believe there  is value to our members, we will send messages or promotions to you on behalf  of another company. In these instances, we do not transfer your name to the  third party — we send the mailing for them. In all instances we only send  mailings if you’ve given your permission. These promotions may include physical  mailings as well, but in a similar fashion will be sent by Football Talk LLC  and only if you’ve given your permission. We may transfer your personal  information to companies that we hire that deliver products and services  (shipping companies, fulfillment companies and email management companies),  companies that operate sweepstakes and promotions on our behalf and sponsors  from whom you have ordered or requested products. These companies will not have  the ability to use the information for their own purposes but will merely use  it to fulfill on our behalf. Visitors who register for fantasy games through  other parties (e.g., through co-branded games) may have some or all of their  profile information (name, email address, etc.) shared with those parties, but  only if you consent (opt-in/opt-out) to having your contact information shared  with those parties so that they can contact you directly. Football Talk LLC is  not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of those other parties.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregate Reports.</strong> Football Talk LLC  will aggregate reports for advertisers. For example, Football Talk LLC may tell  advertisers how many people saw or clicked on an ad and additionally, how many  people saw or clicked on ads in different portions of the Football Talk LLC  sites. Where available, Football Talk LLC may offer additional aggregate  information about viewer characteristics. However, this will not include  personally identifiable information about you or your usage patterns. Our  advertisers allow us to provide their products and services to visitors, and in  return, they will need to know how to effectively place their ads in order to  attract potential customers.</li>
<li><strong>Information Not Released.</strong> Surveys may  ask for contact information or unique identifying information to increase the  value of the results. Contests may require contact information or other  demographic/ personal information in order to determine eligibility. This  information will not be released to third parties without your consent.  Additionally, usage information may be analyzed so that FOOTBALL TALK LLC &nbsp;can judge its system’s performance or execute  visitors’ customized features.</li>
