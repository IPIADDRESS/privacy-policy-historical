This Privacy Policy is posted at our web site to allow users  easy and quick access to ProPay's policy regarding personal information.

<h2>THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE<br>
  PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE UNITED    STATES OF AMERICA</h2>
<h2>Required  Information</h2>
<p>We obtain information about you from a variety  of sources. You provide information about yourself, for example, by completing  the ProPay Account sign-up form. This form asks for your first and last name,  e-mail address, mailing address, day and evening telephone number, Social  Security number, date of birth and the creation of your unique password.  Information about you may also be obtained from credit-reporting agencies,  ProPay Affiliates, other third-party commercial vendors to financial services  firms, and/or your use of ProPay's services. We call this information,  "Merchant Account Information." Merchant Account Information is used  to identify you, prevent possible fraud, and in connection to delivering ProPay  Account services to you. Unique identifier information is used to qualify for,  and set up, a ProPay Account. Refusal to fully complete the sign-up form by  entering accurate information will result in ProPay not being able to provide  services to you. Credit card and checking account information is required to  use specific services of ProPay and is used only to process those transactions  you have initiated. Also, personal information from third parties may be  collected by ProPay on behalf of merchants from the third parties with whom the  merchant engages in business as a result of their connection with ProPay.&nbsp; This third party personal information may include,  but is not limited to, contact information of the third party, such as name,  address, and social security number, as well as credit card information.&nbsp; In the event this information is requested of  the third party and collected by ProPay, ProPay shall only use this information  pursuant to the purposes delineated and contemplated by this Privacy Policy as  further set forth herein. </p>
<h2>Disclosure of  Information</h2>
<p>We use Merchant Account Information in  connection with delivering payment services to you. In order to conduct  financial payment-related transactions and/or to effectively deliver payment  services securely to you, while minimizing the risks of financial loss, it is  often necessary to communicate such Merchant Account Information to or with  financial institutions such as Visa, MasterCard, Discover Card Services,  banking institutions involved in supporting, clearing or settling  payment-related transactions, our corporate Affiliates and/or other companies  we work with. ProPay takes numerous commercially reasonable measures to protect  the personal information that you share. In the event your Merchant Account  becomes delinquent, you authorize ProPay to disclose and communicate all your  Merchant Account Information to third parties for the purpose of collection of  any delinquent amount. If you initiate a transaction that requires credit card  and checking account information, ProPay uses that information only to process  your payment request and will not use it for marketing purposes. ProPay may  also disclose information as permitted by law to governmental regulatory  agencies. For example, we may disclose Merchant Account Information in response  to lawful subpoenas, to credit-reporting agencies, and to help prevent fraud. Any  third party, including by way of example and not limitation, service providers  or agents, or processors with whom ProPay shares your personal information  shall only be permitted to use this personal information for the purposes set  forth above and which are contemplated by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; The types of third parties with whom ProPay  shares your personal information shall be limited to those delineated in the  foregoing, and your personal information shall not be shared with third parties  which fall outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We take commercially reasonable physical,  electronic, and procedural steps to help safeguard your Merchant Account  Information. Our web site takes precautions to protect your information. When  you submit sensitive information via the web site, we take reasonable  commercial measures to protect your information both online and off-line. <br>
  When the registration form or a transaction form asks you to enter  sensitive information (such as credit card number, checking account  information, and/or your Social Security number), that information is  electronically encrypted and is protected. While on a secure page, such as the  registration form or transaction forms, the lock icon on the bottom of web  browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes  locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn  more about ProPay's VeriSign certificate, please <a href="javascript:popup('https://seal.verisign.com/splash?form_file=fdf/splash.fdf&amp;type=GOLD&amp;sealid=1&amp;dn=EPAY.PROPAY.COM&amp;lang=en','verisignpop1','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=550,height=425,location=yes');">click  here</a>. <br>
  While we use VeriSign encryption to protect sensitive information  transferred online, we also take additional reasonable commercial measures to  protect your information offline. All your information, not just the sensitive  information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who  need the information to perform a specific job (such as ProPay's database  administrators, security department employees, and customer service  representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy  practices. Periodically, as well as any time new policies are added, our  employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance of privacy and what  they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. The servers that  store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. <br>
  If you have any questions about the security at ProPay's web site,  please contact us at ProPay <a href="/customerservice/">Customer Service</a>. 
</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>ProPay's web site uses cookies to track  referrals from their Affiliates who have joined an affiliate program. During  login a user may also choose to have ProPay store the user email address in a  cookie to facilitate subsequent logins.</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>ProPay's web site may contain links to other web  sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of  such other web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the ProPay  web site and to read the privacy statement of each and every web site that  collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies  solely to information collected by this web site. </p>
<h2>E-mail Links</h2>
<p>ProPay uses e-mail links located on the  "contact us" page to allow you to contact us directly with any  questions or comments. We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly  to every one. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or  comments. We may also file your comments to improve the web site and program or  may review and discard the information. </p>
<h2>Referral Program</h2>
<p>When available, if you elect to use the ProPay  referral service for informing a friend about ProPay, we will ask you for the  friend's name and e-mail address. We will automatically send the friend a  one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the web site and register for the  service. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this  one-time e-mail. </p>
<h2>Newsletter,  Promotions and Correspondence </h2>
<p>ProPay sends all new members a welcoming e-mail.  By registering with ProPay, you also agree to receive e-mail notifications and  confirmations that are not optional (such as transaction details, changes made  to your profile, etc.) when using our payment systems. Established members will  receive information on special promotions and a newsletter, including product  and service updates. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option to  not receive these types of communications. Please refer to the "Opting  Out" section below. <br>
  We may occasionally present a special promotion. To qualify for  entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that  information with any sponsor(s), we will inform you of that intent in the  specific newsletter or promotion. </p>
<h2>Opting Out</h2>
<p>You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of  receiving further information from ProPay about special promotions or product  updates. The registration form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so you can choose  whether you want marketing material or product updates. If you no longer wish  to receive service updates or promotional materials from ProPay, you may  opt-out of receiving these communications by editing your ProPay Account  profile after you have logged into your account. Also, you have the option to  opt-out from taking receipt of notifications and promotional information sent  to you via email by ProPay.&nbsp; You may  elect to do so, and thereby unsubscribe from email correspondence, by simply  following the unsubscribe instructions which will be provided in each email  correspondence sent to you by ProPay.</p>
<h2>Surveys</h2>
<p>From time-to-time we may request information  from you via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary  and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact information and demographic  information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or  improving the use and satisfaction of our service and/or this web site. </p>
<h2>Notification of  Changes</h2>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we  will notify you via your current e-mail address on file with ProPay so you are  always aware of what information is collected, how it is used, and under which  circumstances, if any, information is disclosed. If at any time we decide to  use personally identifiable information in a manner different from what is  stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by way of an e-mail. </p>
<h2>Former Customers</h2>
<p>If you cancel your ProPay Merchant Account or  your ProPay Merchant Account is closed, we will continue to treat and safeguard  Merchant Account Information about you as described in this Notice. </p>
<h2>For Vermont Account Holders  Only</h2>
<p>If your ProPay Merchant Account has a Vermont billing address,  we will automatically treat your account as if you had opted out as set forth  in this notice. We may share your name and contact information, and information  about our transactions or experiences with you, with credit reporting agencies. </p>
<h2>How to Access and  Update Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>You may access your personal information by  clicking the Edit My Profile link after you log on to your ProPay Account. You  may also make any necessary changes there. You can help ProPay maintain the  accuracy of your personal information by updating your personal profile when  you change your e-mail address, mailing address, or phone numbers. You may also  contact ProPay with any questions you may have by 
contacting us at ProPay <a href="/customerservice/">Customer Service</a>

TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose  mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting  the use of fair information practices.
