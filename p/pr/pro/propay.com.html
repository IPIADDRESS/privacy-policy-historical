      <p class="ptop">ProPay works hard to earn and keep your trust and confidence. This Privacy
          Policy is posted at our web site to allow users easy and quick access
          to ProPay's policy regarding personal information. This notice explains
          how we collect and safeguard information about you and the choices
          you have about our use and disclosure of that information.      </p>
      <p>      </p>
      <div align="center">
        <h2> THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE<br>
          PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</h2>
      </div>
      <h2> Required Information</h2>
      <p class="ptop"> We obtain information about you from a variety of sources. You provide
          information about yourself, for example, by completing the ProPay Account
          sign-up form. This form asks for your first and last name, e-mail address,
          mailing address, day and evening telephone number, Social Security
          number, date of birth and the creation of your unique password. Information
          about you may also be obtained from credit-reporting agencies, ProPay
          Affiliates, other third-party commercial vendors to financial services
          firms, and/or your use of ProPay's services. We call this information, "Merchant
          Account Information." Merchant Account Information is used to identify
          you, prevent possible fraud, and in connection to delivering ProPay
          Account services to you. Unique identifier information is used to qualify
          for, and set up, a ProPay Account. Refusal to fully complete the sign-up
          form by entering accurate information will result in ProPay not being
          able to provide services to you. Credit card and checking account information
          is required to use specific services of ProPay and is used only to
          process those transactions you have initiated. </p>
      <h2> Disclosure of Information</h2>
      <p class="ptop">        We use Merchant Account Information in connection with delivering payment
          services to you. In order to conduct financial payment-related transactions
          and/or to effectively deliver payment services securely to you, while
          minimizing the risks of financial loss, it is often necessary to communicate
          such Merchant Account Information to or with financial institutions
          such as Visa, MasterCard, Discover Card Services, banking institutions
          involved in supporting, clearing or settling payment-related transactions,
          our corporate Affiliates and/or other companies we work with. ProPay
          takes numerous commercially reasonable measures to protect the personal
          information that you share. In the event your Merchant Account becomes
          delinquent, you authorize ProPay to disclose and communicate all your
          Merchant Account Information to third parties for the purpose of collection
          of any delinquent amount. If you initiate a transaction that requires
          credit card and checking account information, ProPay uses that information
          only to process your payment request and will not use it for marketing
          purposes. ProPay may also disclose information as permitted by law
          to governmental regulatory agencies. For example, we may disclose Merchant
          Account Information in response to lawful subpoenas, to credit-reporting
          agencies, and to help prevent fraud.      </p>
      <h2> Security</h2>
      <p class="ptop">        We take commercially reasonable physical, electronic,
         and procedural steps to help safeguard your Merchant Account Information.
        Our web site takes precautions to protect your information. When you
        submit sensitive information via the web site, we take reasonable commercial
        measures to protect your information both online and off-line.      </p>
      <p> When the registration form or a transaction form asks you to enter
        sensitive information (such as credit card number, checking account information,
        and/or your Social Security number), that information is electronically
        encrypted and is protected. While on a secure page, such as the registration
        form or transaction forms, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers
        such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes locked,
        as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn
        more about ProPay's VeriSign certificate, please <a href="javascript:popup('https://seal.verisign.com/splash?form_file=fdf/splash.fdf&amp;type=GOLD&amp;sealid=1&amp;dn=EPAY.PROPAY.COM&amp;lang=en','verisignpop1','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=550,height=425,location=yes');">click
        here</a>.      </p>
      <p> While we use VeriSign encryption to protect sensitive information transferred
        online, we also take additional reasonable commercial measures to protect
        your information offline. All your information, not just the sensitive
        information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees
        who need the information to perform a specific job (such as ProPay's
        database administrators, security department employees, and customer
        service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable
        information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security
        and privacy practices. Periodically, as well as any time new policies
        are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance
        of privacy and what they can do to ensure our customers' information
        is protected. The servers that store personally identifiable information
        are kept in a secure environment.      </p>
      <p> If you have any questions about the security at ProPay's web site,
        please e-mail <a href="mailto:webmaster@propay.com">webmaster@propay.com</a>.      </p>
      <h2> Cookies</h2>
      <p class="ptop">        ProPay's web site uses cookies only to track referrals from their Affiliates
          who have joined an affiliate program and to identify a user when they
          return to the web site.      </p>
      <h2> Links</h2>
      <p class="ptop">        ProPay's web site may contain links to other web sites. Please be aware
          that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other
          web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the ProPay web
          site and to read the privacy statement of each and every web site that
          collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement
          applies solely to information collected by this web site.      </p>
      <h2> E-mail Links</h2>
      <p class="ptop"> ProPay uses e-mail links located on the "contact us" page
        to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments. We
        read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to every one. This
        information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments.
        We may also file your comments to improve the web site and program or
        may review and discard the information. </p>
      <h2> Referral Program</h2>
      <p class="ptop">        When available, if you elect to use the ProPay referral service for informing
          a friend about ProPay, we will ask you for the friend's name and e-mail
          address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting
          them to visit the web site and register for the service. We store this
          information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.      </p>
      <h2> Newsletter, Promotions and Correspondence </h2>
      <p class="ptop"> ProPay sends all new members a welcoming e-mail. By registering
        with ProPay, you also agree to receive e-mail notifications and confirmations
          that are not optional (such as transaction details, changes made to
          your profile, etc.) when using our payment systems. Established members
          will receive information on special promotions and a newsletter, including
          product and service updates. Out of respect for your privacy, we present
          the option to not receive these types of communications. Please refer
          to the "Opting Out" section below. </p>
      <p> We may occasionally present a special promotion. To qualify for entry,
        we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that
        information with any sponsor(s), we will inform you of that intent in
        the specific newsletter or promotion.      </p>
      <h2> Opting Out</h2>
      <p class="ptop">        You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of receiving further information
          from ProPay about special promotions or product updates. The registration
          form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so you can choose whether you want
          marketing material or product updates. If you no longer wish to receive
          service updates or promotional materials from ProPay, you may opt-out
          of receiving these communications by editing your ProPay Account profile
          after you have logged into your account.      </p>
      <h2> Surveys</h2>
      <p class="ptop">
        From time-to-time we may request information from you via surveys. Participation
          in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice
          whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested
          may include contact information and demographic information. Survey
          information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the
          use and satisfaction of our service and/or this web site.      </p>
      <h2> Notification of Changes</h2>
      <p class="ptop">        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will
        notify you via your current e-mail address on file with ProPay so you
        are always aware of what information is collected, how it is used, and
        under which circumstances, if any, information is disclosed. If at any
        time we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner
        different from what is stated at the time it was collected, we will notify
        you by way of an e-mail.      </p>
      <h2> Former Customers</h2>
      <p class="ptop">        If you cancel your ProPay Merchant Account or your ProPay Merchant Account
          is closed, we will continue to treat and safeguard Merchant Account
          Information about you as described in this Notice.      </p>
      <h2> For Vermont Account Holders Only</h2>
      <p class="ptop">        If your ProPay Merchant Account has a Vermont billing
        address, we will automatically treat your account as if you had opted
        out as set forth in this notice. We may share your name and contact information,
        and information about our transactions or experiences with you, with
        credit reporting agencies.      </p>
      <h2> How to Access and Update Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p class="ptop">        You may access your personal information by clicking the Edit My Profile
          link after you log on to your ProPay Account. You may also make any
          necessary changes there. You can help ProPay maintain the accuracy
          of your personal information by updating your personal profile when
          you change your e-mail address, mailing address, or phone numbers.
