        <b>May 27, 2011</b>
        Proxy engines have been extensively upgraded to
harvest/scan/test
nearly
100,000 HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS proxies a day, with improved test yield that
will allow for much more available working proxies for subscribers. It
means many specialized filters, such as Scrapebox filter (one of a kind
in the
world) that give the subscribers the additional working proxies for
their needs. In other words, no need to deal with SEO tool's built
in proxy testers that would not be able to match Proxylist's
superior proxy testing engines.
