<p>At the time you express interest in attaining additional information, or when you register for the service, we may also ask for additional information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. Customers can update or remove their information at any time by logging into the Services and editing their information within the Administration section. Customers can view their updated profiles to confirm the edits have been made.</p>

<p>Project Insight uses the information that we collect to set up Services for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers to discuss customer interest in our company, the Services that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Customers are asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service to receive a username and password. We may email information regarding updates to the Service or company, or may also send a customer newsletter.</p>

<p>We share information, including personal information, with our third-party service providers that we use to provide hosting for and maintenance of our Websites, application development, backup, storage, payment processing, analytics and other services for us. These third-party service providers may have access to or process your personal information for providing these services for us. We do not permit our third-party service providers to use the personal information that we share with them for their marketing purposes or for any other purpose than relating to the services they provide to us.</p>

This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Services for continuous quality improvement. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p>

<div class="tile-subtitle-gray">Cookies and other tracking technologies from your use of the Services</div>
 
<p>When you interact with your Services, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to your Services, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the website previously.</p>

<p>Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to us, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a 'trial period,' you remain anonymous to us. Cookies come in two forms: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.</p>

<p>Project Insight uses session cookies containing encrypted or encoded information including your username and session ID. This information allows us to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you have logged in and are required to use the Services. Project Insight uses persistent cookies that only we can read and use, to identify the fact that you are our customer or prior Project Insight website visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our website but will not be able to successfully use our Services.</p>

<p>We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Web browsers offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information.
