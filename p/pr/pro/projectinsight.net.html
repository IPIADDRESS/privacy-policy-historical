<h1>Project Insight Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Project Insight (collectively, "Project Insight" or "Metafuse" or "Metafuse, Inc." or "we" or "us" or "our") has created this privacy statement ("Policy") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Policy as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Policy and will provide notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this Policy, our "Services" refer to the Project Insight™ Website, Project Insight SaaS project portfolio and management solution and any connectors to other cloud business applications like the Atlassian's Jira SaaS, Salesforce.com, Zendesk and others.</p>

<h2>Collected Information</h2>

<p>We require customers who register to use the Services offered on our website to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization that will be using the Services.</p>

<p>At the time you express interest in attaining additional information, or when you register for the service, we may also ask for additional information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. Customers can update or remove their information at any time by logging into the Services and editing their information within the Administration section. Customers can view their updated profiles to confirm the edits have been made.</p>

<p>Project Insight uses the information that we collect to set up Services for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers in order to discuss customer interest in our company, the Services that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Customers are asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service in order to receive a username and password. We may email information regarding updates to the Service or company, or may also send a customer newsletter. Customer email addresses and any customer information will not be distributed or shared with any third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by using the unsubscribe link provided in each email or calling 949-476-6499.</p>

<p>Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for in a Services Agreement, we do not disclose to any third-party the information provided. All financial and billing information that we collect through the website is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for Services. This billing information is not used by Project Insight for third-party marketing or promotional purposes.</p>

<p>Project Insight uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the website but they are not permitted to collect any information nor does Project Insight share any user information with these parties.</p>

<p>Our customers will be using the Services to host data and information ("Data"). Project Insight will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in a Services Agreement, or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of providing customer support, research a suspected violation of a Services Agreement, or as may be required by law. Customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.</p>

<p>Project Insight may also collect certain information from visitors to, and customers of the website, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Services in order to constantly improve the quality of the Services. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p>

<h2>Cookies and other tracking technologies from your use of the Services</h2>

<p>When you interact with your Services, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to your Services, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the website previously.</p>

<p>Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to us, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a 'trial period,' you remain anonymous to us. Cookies come in two forms: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.</p>

<p>Project Insight uses session cookies containing encrypted or encoded information including your username and session ID. This information allows us to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you have logged in and are required in order to use the Services. Project Insight uses persistent cookies that only we can read and use, to identify the fact that you are our customer or prior Project Insight website visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our website but will not be able to successfully use our Services.</p>

<p>We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Web browsers offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information. For further information on how to manage Flash LSOs please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" title="Manage Flash LSOs">here</a>.</p>
		
<h2>Log Files from use our Services</h2>

<p>As is true with most websites and services, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses, browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data as well as certain personal information such as user name, user email address and other information that may be included in open text fields. Our Services log files are subject to the same strict data security policies and procedures as apply to our Services. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve the Services that we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or Services functionality.</p>

<h2>Analytics information from your use of our Services</h2>

If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" title="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">here</a> (or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" title="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">here</a>).
