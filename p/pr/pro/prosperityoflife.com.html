This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and explains data collection and use practices for the Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris Network. The "Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris Network" includes all Web pages, newsletters, discussion forums and lists and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris, and each of its wholly-owned subsidiaries as linked directly or indirectly from the polarisglobal.com (collectively the "Site") home page (collectively hereafter "Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris"). By accessing the Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris Network, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy. We promise that we will use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy as follows:</p><p><br></p><p>What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it? Do you collect IP addresses?</p><p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as a computer's "Internet Protocol" (IP) address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our Sites. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris Network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of the visitors.</p><p><br></p><p>What are cookies?</p><p>From time to time, Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris or its advertisers may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.

The Polaris Global Network may also contain advertisements of third parties. Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party web sites or advertisers. Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris does not share any of the individual personal information you provide Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris with the third parties to which Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris links, except as stated elsewhere within this Privacy Policy, although Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris may share general, aggregate data with such third parties (such as how many people use our site). Please check with those web sites to determine their privacy policy. If you use Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris's discussion threads, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these discussion threads. In order to avoid your e-mail address or other personal information from being gathered and used by others for inappropriate or harmful purposes, Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris advises that you should be cautious about posting a real e-mail address or other personal information to newsgroups, chats, or other public forums. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through email, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Certain Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris properties use a shopping-cart feature that safeguards this information by using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Other Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris media properties do not use SSL and thereby do not offer a secure coded way to transfer information.

In connection with the foregoing, we may transfer some or all of your information in order that the service being provided to you may continue, or for other business purposes.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Your Consent To This Agreement</p><p>By using the Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris Network, you consent to the collection and use of information by Prosperity of Life powered by Polaris as specified above. We reserve the right to modify this Policy. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
