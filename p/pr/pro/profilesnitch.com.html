                <p>This privacy policy covers how we treat personal information that we collect and receive. We do not intend to 

collect any personal information from children under 13 unless we believe such collection to be permitted by law. 

Please see below for our policy with respect to children under 13. </p>

<b>General</b>
<p>
ProfileSnitch.com is a <a href="http://www.profilesnitch.com/about-myspace-trackers.php">MySpace Tracker</a> site, which
records visitor information on your MySpace profile by way of inserting special html codes in your MySpace profile. If you are unclear
what a MySpace tracker is, please <a href="http://www.profilesnitch.com/about-myspace-trackers.php">follow this link</a> for a full,
no non-sense explanation.
</p>
<p>We gather user information to provide you with a customized experience on our site. Your user information helps 

us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, we may 

ask you to register or to provide personal information when you post comments, enter a contest, order products, 

subscribe to a newsletter and/or visit certain areas of our site. If you choose not to register you may not have 

access to areas that require personal identification. </p>

<p>If you register with our site or purchase products from us, from time to time we may e-mail you with messages 

about our services or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new 

products, features, services, special offers and updated information. The newsletters may contain code that 

enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether the e-mail was opened and/or what 

links (if any) were clicked. We will combine that information with other information we have about you and may use 

that information to improve your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications to you. In 

addition, if you register with our site or purchase products you may automatically receive e-mails confirming your 

registration and/or purchase and providing you with necessary information relating to the access or use of your 

registration and/or purchase. With the exception of the e-mails described in the preceding sentence which are 

necessary to provide customer support and deliver products and services to you, you may opt-out of receiving 

e-mail from us as described below. </p>

<b>Use of Services</b>
<p>
ProfileSnitch.com makes no gauranatees to its tracking service, and by using our service the end user agrees that 

all liability and risk lies at their own expense. While we strive to offer a quality tracking service, we make no assurances 

regarding uptime, availability, functionality, etc.  Lifetime and premium monthly membership subscribers agree

not to hold ProfileSnitch liable for any amount for failing to provide the service.  By using the service, you 

understand that MySpace may render the service useless by way of blocking ProfileSnitch, or by making modifications to 

its own system that renders ProfileSnitch's tracking ability useless.  By using our service you agree to assume this risk and further agree not to hold

ProfileSnitch liable for any stoppages in the service due to MySpace or any other reason. ProfileSnitch is in no way related to or affiliated with Myspace, and is not a sanctioned

service of MySpace.
</p>

<b>Use of Information</b>
<p>
When you register, we ask for your e-mail address, a unique nickname selected by you and other information. Once 

you are a registered user you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential 

information. This e-mail, nickname and password should not be your MySpace user identity or related to your 

MySpace user identity in anyway. We will never ask for your MySpace e-mail and password.
</p>
<p>
We may use an order form for users to request information, products and services. For that order form, we collect 

a user's contact information (e-mail address) and necessary financial information to process the order (i.e. 

credit card number). Contact information from the order (including e-mail) may be used to deliver digital products 

and information. We may use third parties to accept and process orders and credit card purchases for merchandise 

and products, including software. 
</p>
<p>
We may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for 

entry in that contest or promotion, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that 

information with the sponsor(s) or with others, we will provide a statement to that effect in the contest or 

promotion terms. 
</p>
<p>
All communication on the Internet takes place between pairs of IP Addresses. Our Web servers will log the IP 

address that any connection is made from. These IP addresses are used to determine your city location for the 

purposes of tracking for other ProfileSnitch members. By using ProfileSnitch you agree to have other ProfileSnitch 

members see your IP address, and thus reveal your city location and your MySpace profile Id.
</p>

<b>Information Sharing</b>
<p>
We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties, aside from entities that perform 

services for us, such as fulfilling orders or processing payment, that either are bound to comply with our privacy 

policy or have privacy policies that protect your information unless you have “opted-in?to such sharing. If you 

have previously opted-in to such sharing under a prior privacy policy version, you are still considered to have 

opted-in under this privacy policy. As stated, and whether or not you have opted-in, we may use third parties to 

accept and process orders for merchandise and products, including software, and such third parties may get access 

to your personal information for the purposes of providing services or products to you on our behalf. In addition, 

if you opt-out, we may share that information with third parties who send e-mails on our behalf so that they do 

not e-mail you. 
</p>
<p>
However, we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief 

that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend 

our rights or property; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety. 
</p>
<p>
We may request demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level or household income) from 

time to time. We will not share that information in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other 

entity, unless we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your permission. When we share 

demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.

instructions that appear on each newsletter. You may also contact us as provided below. Please note that there 

might be a brief delay between when you submit your request to opt-out and when it is processed and reflected in 

our systems; accordingly you might continue to receive e-mails from us for a few days after you unsubscribe. We 

maintain records of those users who opt-out of specific e-mail options so that we do not e-mail them with respect 

to those types of e-mails, and we may share this information with third parties who send e-mails on our behalf so 

that they do not e-mail you; this information may also be contained in web logs (see above).

Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the sites that ask for age, we do not collect

e-mail or postal mail as listed below. We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a 

child under the age of 13. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived in web 

logs and back-up archives after we delete the information from its active database (see above regarding web logs, 

and below regarding archived information). 
</p>
<p>
We believe that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control 

tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online 

environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other 

personal information without parental permission.
