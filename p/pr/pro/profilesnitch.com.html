            <b><font size="large">Privacy Policy</font></b>
                <p>This privacy policy covers how we treat personal information that we collect and receive. We do not intend to 

collect any personal information from children under 13 unless we believe such collection to be permitted by law. 

Please see below for our policy with respect to children under 13. </p>

<b>General</b>
<p>We gather user information to provide you with a customized experience on our site. Your user information helps 

us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, we may 

ask you to register or to provide personal information when you post comments, enter a contest, order products, 

subscribe to a newsletter and/or visit certain areas of our site. If you choose not to register you may not have 

access to areas that require personal identification. </p>

<p>If you register with our site or purchase products from us, from time to time we may e-mail you with messages 

about our services or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new 

products, features, services, special offers and updated information. The newsletters may contain code that 

enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether the e-mail was opened and/or what 

links (if any) were clicked. We will combine that information with other information we have about you and may use 

that information to improve your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications to you. In 

addition, if you register with our site or purchase products you may automatically receive e-mails confirming your 

registration and/or purchase and providing you with necessary information relating to the access or use of your 

registration and/or purchase. With the exception of the e-mails described in the preceding sentence which are 

necessary to provide customer support and deliver products and services to you, you may opt-out of receiving 

e-mail from us as described below. </p>

<b>Use of Services</b>
<p>
ProfileSnitch.com makes no gauranatees to its tracking service, and by using our service the end user agrees that 

all liability and risk lies at their own expense. While we strive to offer a quality tracking service, we cannot 

promise any assurances to uptime, availability, functionality, etc. This is a free service and thusly its 

obligations to its users should be kept in mind as such. ProfileSnitch is in no way related to or affiliated with 

Myspace.
</p>

<b>Use of Information</b>
<p>
When you register, we ask for your e-mail address, a unique nickname selected by you and other information. Once 

you are a registered user you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential 

information. This e-mail, nickname and password should not be your MySpace user identity or related to your 

MySpace user identity in anyway. We will never ask for your MySpace e-mail and password.
</p>
<p>
We may use an order form for users to request information, products and services. For that order form, we collect 

a user's contact information (e-mail address) and necessary financial information to process the order (i.e. 

credit card number). Contact information from the order (including e-mail) may be used to deliver digital products 

and information. We may use third parties to accept and process orders and credit card purchases for merchandise 

and products, including software. 
</p>
<p>
We may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for 

entry in that contest or promotion, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that 

information with the sponsor(s) or with others, we will provide a statement to that effect in the contest or 

promotion terms. 
</p>
<p>
All communication on the Internet takes place between pairs of IP Addresses. Our Web servers will log the IP 

address that any connection is made from. These IP addresses are used to determine your city location for the 

purposes of tracking for other ProfileSnitch members. By using ProfileSnitch you agree to have other ProfileSnitch 

members see your IP address, and thus reveal your city location and your MySpace profile Id.
</p>
<p>
Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. A “cookie?is a small 

line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and to help us provide better 

service to you. We use cookies to save your password (in an encrypted format) on your machine so you don't have to 

re-enter it each time you visit our site. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and 

track your downloads and purchases from our site. 
</p>
<p>
We use companies [Google ( Google.com ), to serve the advertisements on some of our pages. These companies and 

advertisers may place and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject 

to their own privacy policies, not ours. We may use your information or allow advertisers or companies that serve 

advertisements access to your information to determine which advertisements you will see. This information may 

include your demographic information, geographic location, what content you access on our site, how you rate 

various content, language contained in your comments and other information. 
</p>
<p>
Our site contains links, including banner and other ads, to other Websites. We are not responsible for the privacy 

practices or the content of such Websites. Our site may also link to Websites that feature our trademarks and 

names along with trademarks and names of other companies. You should look at the privacy policy on that co-branded 

Website, as the co-branded Website may not be under our control. 
</p>
<p>
Applications you use or download from our site may contain third party digital rights management systems (DRMS) 

which may allow for communication between your software and the third party and utilize security features (e.g., 

preventing distribution of or access to the applications in the event of unauthorized use). These DRMS are subject 

to their own license agreements and you agree that we shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of any sort 

relating to the use of the DRMS or your dealings with such third parties. The applications may also contain DRMS 

produced by us which allow for communication between the applications you use or download and our systems and 

which collect information describing your computer system in order to prevent illegal or unauthorized use of the 

applications. 
</p>
<p>
For reasons such as improving member experience and providing customized communications to our users, we may 

receive information about you from third party sources and our web logs and add it to the information that we have 

received from you. Web logs automatically record anything a web server sees, which may include e-mail addresses 

you enter into a form or pages viewed by a user at a particular IP address. 
</p>

<b>Information Sharing</b>
<p>
We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties, aside from entities that perform 

services for us, such as fulfilling orders or processing payment, that either are bound to comply with our privacy 

policy or have privacy policies that protect your information unless you have “opted-in?to such sharing. If you 

have previously opted-in to such sharing under a prior privacy policy version, you are still considered to have 

opted-in under this privacy policy. As stated, and whether or not you have opted-in, we may use third parties to 

accept and process orders for merchandise and products, including software, and such third parties may get access 

to your personal information for the purposes of providing services or products to you on our behalf. In addition, 

if you opt-out, we may share that information with third parties who send e-mails on our behalf so that they do 

not e-mail you. 
</p>
<p>
However, we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief 

that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend 

our rights or property; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety. 
</p>
<p>
We may request demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level or household income) from 

time to time. We will not share that information in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other 

entity, unless we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your permission. When we share 

demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only. 
</p>
<p>
In the event that we acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred 

to the acquiring party. 
</p>

<b>Opt-Out</b>
<p>
If you provide us with your e-mail address, and do not opt-out of receiving e-mail from us, we may e-mail you with 

information, including information about selected third parties. If you do not want to receive information from 

us, you may decline to receive it (or “Opt-Out? either when you provide personal information to us or you may 

update your profile. You may also choose to Opt-Out from certain types of e-mail by following the unsubscribe 

instructions that appear on each newsletter. You may also contact us as provided below. Please note that there 

might be a brief delay between when you submit your request to opt-out and when it is processed and reflected in 

our systems; accordingly you might continue to receive e-mails from us for a few days after you unsubscribe. We 

maintain records of those users who opt-out of specific e-mail options so that we do not e-mail them with respect 

to those types of e-mails, and we may share this information with third parties who send e-mails on our behalf so 

that they do not e-mail you; this information may also be contained in web logs (see above). 
</p>

<b>Children Under 13</b>
<p>
Our site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We assume products purchased through credit card means 

are purchased by adults. We respect the privacy of parents and children and are committed to complying with the 

Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the sites that ask for age, we do not collect 

personal information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited 

circumstances where we believe that such collection is permitted under COPPA. 
</p>
<p>
If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to we, he or she can contact us via 

e-mail or postal mail as listed below. We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a 

child under the age of 13. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived in web 

logs and back-up archives after we delete the information from its active database (see above regarding web logs, 

and below regarding archived information). 
</p>
<p>
We believe that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control 

tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online 

environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other 

personal information without parental permission. 
</p>

<b>Other</b>
<p>
We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our 

control. These include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration 

information in a separate database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of 

information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information 

transmitted to us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure. We will protect 

the transmission of credit card information through industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. 
</p>
<p>
We may offer chat, user reviews, multi-player games, bulletin board, or other public functions and any posting by 

you is considered public information available to other users. Any posting is governed by our Terms of Use 

[hyperlink to this]. You should take care to not use personal information in your screen name or other information 

that might be publicly available to other users. 
</p>
<p>
If a user elects to use our site for informing a friend about our site or particular features or content, we ask 

them for the friend's name and e-mail address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting 

them to visit our site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail. 
</p>
<p>
Your personal information is password-protected, and you should take appropriate measures to protect the secrecy 

of your password. If you use a computer in a public place or share a computer with others, remember to sign out 

and close your browser window when you finish a session with us in order to prevent others from accessing your 

personal information. 
</p>
<p>
We maintain archives of our web logs, database, and other systems and information. Please note that it is possible 

some of this information may remain archived after we delete the information from its active database (see above 

regarding web logs). We maintain archives for disaster recovery, legal and other non-marketing purposes. 
</p>
