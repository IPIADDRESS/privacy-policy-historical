<p>We like to provide you with a personalised web service, which makes it necessary for us to hold and process your personal information. According to the legal definition, personal data is every data that allows the identification of a natural person. It is sufficient that the data allow us to establish a (direct or indirect) link between one or more data pieces and a natural person.</p>
<p>At Proxyclick, we are committed to making sure that your personal information is kept confidential, and that it is only used for those specific purposes that are in-line with Proxyclick’s mission to assist you with Visitor Management and/or your facility-related service requests (Service Desk). We are convinced that such privacy policy is essential to creating confidence, goodwill and stronger relationships with you, our customers. That is why we inform you in the most extensive manner about the collecting and processing of your personal data. Therefore, you will always be aware of the type, the extent of, and the purposes for which personal data are collected and used.</p>
<p>By providing you this information, we confirm our compliance with the most important strict legislative conditions as required by the Belgian data protection legislation – in particular, the Act of 8 December 1992 on Privacy Protection in relation to the Processing of Personal Data (Privacy Act), which implemented the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC.</p>
<p>We assume that the user of our applications has taken notice of this Privacy Policy and agreed to the collection and processing of personal information that are in accordance thereto. Be aware that we do occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and that it is your responsibility to examine and take notification of any change made to this document. So please do return and review this Policy on a regular basis. Any substantial change will be clearly communicated.</p>
<p>If you still have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to contact us at info@proxyclick.com. We’d love to hear your feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Who is responsible for the data processing?</strong></p>
<p>The Privacy Act draws a distinction between a ‘data controller’ and a ‘data processor’. We provide you with a clear notice of this distinction, as this is extremely important to avoid some ambiguity about responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Data Controller</strong></p>
<p>The data controller is every natural person and/or legal entity that determines the purposes and the means (legal and technical) of the processing of personal data. This determination can be done alone or jointly with others.</p>
<p>The data controller behind ‘Visitor Management’ and ‘Service Desk’ is:</p>
<em>PROXYCLICK sprl</em><br><em>Rue Fernand Bernier 15</em><br> <em>B-1060 Brussels</em><br><em>Belgium</em><br><em>Registration Number: BE0863.261.693</em><br><em>Tel:+32 25 43 44 23</em><br> <em>Email: <a href="mailto:info@proxyclick.com">info@proxyclick.com</a></em>
<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
<p>We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to be only accessed by those authorized with special access rights to our systems. Furthermore, we are always ready to perform audits on request.</p>
<p>Be aware that Proxyclick is only the data controller for what is provided underneath. You are the one assuming responsibility for the personal data of third parties you published or shared through our application, including those of your visitors. You declare to have the right to communicate or display them, thus relieving the data controller of all responsibility. Regarding these data, Proxyclick only acts as actual processor.</p>
<p><strong>Data Processors</strong></p>
<p>Proxyclick uses a number of online data processors that collect, store and process your data. These data processors are natural persons or legal entities that process the personal data on behalf of the data controller Proxyclick.The personswho, under the direct authority of the party responsible for the processing, are authorised to process the data do not fall within this category.</p>
<p>We have carefully selected these processors, which are fully listed in Section 6. The selected processors offer notably all the adequate guarantees with regard to technical and organizational security measures taken as to the processing of your personal data. They also satisfy all the other requirements of Article 16, §1 of the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>The controller is not responsible for any loss or corruption of personal data, identity theft, data theft, viruses or Trojans, SQL injections or other attacks on computer systems or online cloud portals. The processors have gained professional expertise in their domain and therefore decide in an autonomous manner the most technically appropriate application to process the data. The data controller is not expected to have the same expertise and specialty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. What information do we collect about you?</strong></p>
<p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about your computer such as hardware and software, and about your visits to and use of this website (including your IP address, geographical location, operating system and browser type).</li>
<li>Information that you provide to us for the purpose of registration, which is required to obtain access to the application (Visitor Management or Service Desk). The registration requires you to provide us with personal contact information, such as your name, company name and email address, and to select a password. In addition, upon the purchase of a subscription, we also require certain financial information, which we will not have access to as it will be managed by payment providers</li>
<li>Any other information that you choose to send to us, such as when you contact us with inquiries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dependent on whether the user makes intensive use of the website or relies on certain services, the collection of personal data may be more extensive.</p>
<p>The website also collects anonymous data, which is corresponding technical data that is used solely for internal purposes to get information on user navigation. Since these data are not used to identify users, they do fall outside this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. For what purposes do we process the data? </strong></p>
<p>We process your personal information for an overarching goal: we want to offer you the best-personalised experience when visiting our website and using our applications.</p>
<p>The information we collect about you is primarily processed to help us ensure the user the proper technical functioning of the website and to provide you access to the application in a secure, effective and user-related manner. Our aim is to provide you with the best possible services. We need your information in order to better understand how you access and use our website and services, to then be able to improve them and respond to your wishes, questions and criticisms.</p>
<p>We would like to offer our services in the most efficient and personalised way. This implies that we may use your personal information to tailor the content we send or display to you, to offer location customization, and personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using the website or our services.</p>
<p>We may also use your information internally for marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we may use it to send you news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions, or to otherwise contact you about products or information we think may interest you. You can always unsubscribe from such e-mails.</p>
<p>The way we offer you the application and its related services remains subject to constant changes, as we are still evolving. It is therefore important that you give us permission to use your personal information in a manner that allows us to develop new innovative features and services. These new developments remain within our original objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. How long will we hold your data?</strong></p>
<p>We only process your personal information as long as necessary. We do keep a record of your data as long as your account is active, or if your personal data is necessary to offer you a particular service. We promise to delete your personal data as soon as this data is no longer required for the aforementioned purposes. The deletion is comparable to deleting files on your computer using the ‘trash bin’, allowing us to recover the data to a certain extent for some time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
