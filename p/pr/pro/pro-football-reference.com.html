<h1>SPORTS REFERENCE LLC  -  Privacy Statement</h1>

<p> A combination of sites providing top-notch statistics and
resources for sports fans everywhere.

</p><p> This Privacy Statement sets forth the information-gathering, use,
and dissemination practices of Sports Reference LLC, its
subsidiaries, and affiliates (collectively referred to as "SRL") in
connection with the World Wide Web sites located at
www.sports-reference.com, www.baseball-reference.com,
www.pro-football-reference.com, www.basketball-reference.com, hockey-reference.com,
www.baseballbooks.net, and all other Web sites owned or operated by
SRL (the "Site").  This Privacy Statement addresses SRL's practices
regarding information collected only directly through or from the Site
- it does not address or govern any information gathering, use, or
dissemination practices related to information collected other than
directly through or from the Site, including, without limitation, from
or via telephone, facsimile, postal mail, personal delivery, or other
or additional offline means or media.  SRL can be contacted by mail,
phone, facsimile, or by e-mail at SRL, as provided in Paragraph 3 of
this Privacy Statement.

</p><h2>1. Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors</h2>

<p> SRL may collect or track (1) the home server domain names, e-mail
addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine
used, operating system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the
Site, (2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with SRL
via e-mail, (3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in
online forms, registration forms, surveys, e-mail, contest entries,
and other online avenues (including, without limitation, demographic
and personal profile data), and (4) aggregate and user-specific
information regarding which pages Site visitors access.

</p><p> SRL may place Internet "cookies" on visitors' hard drives.
Internet cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the
visitor's name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen
preferences, and the pages of the Site viewed by the visitor.  When
the visitor revisits the Site, SRL may recognize the visitor by the
Internet cookie and customize the visitor's experience accordingly,
for example, in pre-filling forms.  Visitors may decline or remove
Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their
Web client software, if available.

</p><p> SRL also may use Web bugs to gather, store, and track certain
information related to your visit to and activity on the Site.  A Web
bug is a file object, which can be a graphic image such as a
transparent one pixel-by-one pixel graphics file, which is placed on a
Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity.  A Web bug
can gather, for example, the IP address of your computer, the time the
Web page was viewed, and the type of browser used.

</p><p> When a visitor performs a search within the Site, SRL may record
information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the
search performed.  SRL may also record limited information for every
search request and use that information to solve technical problems
with the services available directly or indirectly in connection with
the Site, and to calculate overall usage statistics.

</p><h2> 2. Payment Information</h2>


<p> We use third-party payment service providers such as Amazon.com™
and PayPal™ to handle any monetary transactions.  SRL does not store
any of your private payment information provided by you directly to
these service providers.  

</p><h2>3. Comments, Notices and Chat Rooms</h2>


<p> Comments posted to any of our Web pages are public.  All other
notices sent to SRL should use the following address or contact
information:

</p><pre>     Sports Reference LLC
     6757 Greene St, Suite 315
     Philadelphia, PA  19119
     Fax 800/660-5292
     Phone 215/301-9181
     sf@sports-reference.com
</pre>

<p> With respect to chat rooms, SRL does not, and is not obligated to,
monitor or review any areas on the Site, or the content therein, where
users transmit or post communications or communicate with each other
regarding SRL or Content (see <a href="termsofuse.shtml">Terms and Conditions</a>) on the
Site, including but not limited to, communications in chat rooms,
bulletin boards or other user forums.  As such, SRL assumes no
liability for the accuracy of such information, no duty to update or
correct such information, and no liability for such communications
arising under the laws of copyright, libel, privacy, obscenity, or
otherwise.


</p><h2>4.	Use of Personal Data Collected</h2>


<p> Personal data collected by SRL may be used by SRL for many
reasons, for example, for editorial and feedback purposes, for
marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of
users' behavior, for product development, for content improvement, for
fulfillment of a requested transaction or record-keeping, or to
customize the content and layout of the Site.  Aggregate data on
visitors' home servers may be used for internal purposes, and
individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail
addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which
visitors voluntarily provide to SRL may be added to SRL's databases
and used for future calls and mailings regarding Site updates, new
products and services, and upcoming events.

</p><p> With respect to visitor e-mail addresses, we allow users to post
their e-mail address on comments or in sponsorships, in the event that
they wish to allow others to reach them easily.  Visitor e-mail
addresses from comments are not used by SRL to generate mailing lists.

</p><p> SRL also may use Site visitor data to contact the Site visitors
regarding account status and changes to the <a href="termsofuse.shtml">Terms and Conditions</a>, any subscriber
agreement, this Privacy Statement, and any other policies or
agreements relevant to Site visitors.

</p><h2>5.	Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties</h2>


<p> Subject to the limitations of Paragraph 4, aggregate data on
visitors' home servers may be provided to third parties such as
marketing firms.


</p><p> Identifiable and non-identifiable visitor information and data
which visitors provide to SRL may be provided to third parties who
provide products, information, or services which SRL believes that
visitors may be interested in directly or indirectly purchasing or
obtaining.  Identifiable or non-identifiable data also may be
disclosed or distributed to another party with which SRL enters or
reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as, for
example, a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or asset purchase, or
to a third party pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of
legal process, in response to a request by or on behalf of any local,
state, federal, or other government agency, department, or body,
whether or not pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of
legal process, or if determined by SRL in its sole judgment that such
disclosure or distribution is appropriate to protect the life, health,
security, or property of SRL or any other person or entity.

</p><p> While SRL will undertake efforts to see that any third party to
which SRL shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal data
is under a contractual obligation to use the personal data solely for
the purposes for which the data was disclosed, such third parties are
independent third parties over which SRL exercises no control, and SRL
is not responsible for their conduct, actions, omissions, or
information handling or dissemination practices and SRL will not be
liable therefor.

</p><p> This Site may contain links to other World Wide Web sites or
advertisements for or placed by third parties.  SRL is not responsible
for the privacy practices of such Web sites, advertisers, or third
parties, or for the content of such sites or advertisements.  It is
possible that these links or advertisements, themselves, may be used
by third parties or others to collect personal or other information
about Site visitors.  It is solely the visitor's obligation to review
and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other Web
sites and of these advertisers and third parties.

</p><h2>6.	Security Measures</h2>


<p> SRL has implemented numerous security features to prevent the
unauthorized release of or access to personal information.  For
example, SRL: undertakes all efforts to maintain a secure server; does
not store any user credit card information; and requires employees and
service providers who work for or with SRL to sign confidentiality and
security contracts restricting their use of any data related to user
information.  Please be advised, however, that the confidentiality of
any communication or material transmitted to or from SRL via this Site
or e-mail cannot be guaranteed.  Accordingly, SRL is not responsible
for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.  Instead
of communicating with SRL via e-mail or the Internet, visitors can
contact SRL by mail, phone, or facsimile, as provided in Paragraph 3
of this Privacy Statement.

</p><h2>7.	Opt-Out Right</h2>


<p> Except as necessary for SRL to provide the services, information,
or products requested by a visitor, the visitor may opt out of having
his or her personally identifiable information, which has been
voluntarily provided to SRL through an account registration, customer
order, or electronic news or information subscription, prospectively
retained by SRL, used by SRL for secondary purposes, or disclosed by
SRL to third parties by contacting SRL via postal mail, e-mail, or
facsimile at the addresses set out above.  (This does not apply to
collection of the type of Web browser of the visitor to the Site or to
information provided or collected that does not meet the above
description.)  By way of illustration, you have the option to remove
your name from any of our mailing lists at any time.


</p><h2>8.	Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Data</h2>


<p> Upon a visitor's request via postal mail, e-mail, or facsimile,
SRL will provide to the visitor a summary of any personally
identifiable information retained by SRL regarding the visitor, which
information has been voluntarily provided to SRL through an account
registration, customer order, or electronic news or information
subscription.  A visitor may modify, correct, change or update their
personally identifiable information by contacting SRL via postal mail,
e-mail, facsimile, or telephone as provided in Paragraph 3 of this
Privacy Statement.

</p><h2>9.	Right to Change Privacy Statement</h2>


<p> SRL may change this Privacy Statement at any time.  Notice of any
new or revised Privacy Statement, as well as the location of the new
or revised statement, will be posted on the Site for at least 60 days
after the change.  It is the obligation of users visiting the Site to
learn of changes to the Privacy Statement since their last visit.  Any
change to this Privacy Statement shall be effective as to all visitors
once instituted, including as to any visitor who previously visited
the Site before the change was made.
