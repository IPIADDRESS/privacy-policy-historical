<p>1. Acceptance of Policy</p>

<p>Clicksmart and its parent, subsidiary, and affiliated
companies ("Clicksmart", "We", or "Us") are
committed to protecting your privacy. Accordingly, we have adopted this Privacy
Policy to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy and explain how we may and
may not use the information you provide us. In consideration of the information
and services Clicksmart provides to you on the Clicksmart Web site (the
"Site"), you agree to Clicksmart’s collection and use of your
personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, which may be updated
by us from time to time without notice. You can review the most current version
of the Privacy Policy at any time at http://www.clicksmart.com/privacy. Please
read the Privacy Policy in its entirety. By using and continuing to use this
Site, you agree to and accept the Privacy Policy, as it may be revised from
time to time. If you do not agree with the Privacy Policy, you must immediately
stop using the Site.</p>

<p>2. What This Policy Covers</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers Clicksmart’s treatment of
personally identifiable information that Clicksmart collects when you are on
the Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that
Clicksmart does not own or to people that Clicksmart does not employ. This
includes companies and Web sites that Clicksmart may link to on the Site.</p>

<p>3. Collection of Information</p>

<p>Clicksmart collects personal information from you when you
register on the Site and when you interact with our corporate office. We may
also receive personal information from our business partners. Clicksmart also
automatically receives and records information from our server logs from your
browser, such as your IP address, Clicksmart cookie information, the date and
time of your visits, and the pages of our Site you are viewing.</p>

<p>4. Use of Your Information</p>

<p>We use the personal information that you provide to us to
generally provide you with the best possible information and services. In
addition, we use the information to customize the content you see, to provide
you with services, to improve the Site and our services and operations, and to
contact you when appropriate.</p>

<p>5. Sharing of Your Information</p>

<p>Because we value your privacy, Clicksmart limits the people
with whom we may share your information. We will only share your personally-identifiable
information with: (a) our employees and agents, in the regular course of their
providing services to us, (b) our parent, subsidiary, and affiliated companies,
(c) other third parties if we have your consent to share the information, (d)
other third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, or
otherwise as required by law or to protect our legal rights.</p>

<p>6. Email and Requests For Information</p>

<p>Clicksmart allows you to email advertisers or request
information from them through the Clicksmart website. Any information you enter into forms when
emailing or requesting information from specific advertisers will be sent to
those advertisers.</p>

<p>7. Telephone Calls</p>

<p>In the event you utilize Clicksmart’s Click to Call feature
or dial a telephone number of an advertiser on the Clicksmart site, we may
forward to the advertiser details of the phone call, such as your phone number,
your location, the time and duration of the call, and other information.</p>

<p>8. Aggregate Information</p>

<p>Clicksmart collects and compiles aggregate information about
our Site, our users, and our users’ demographic and behavioral information,
such as how much traffic the Site receives. So long as such aggregate information
does not contain personally identifiable information, we reserve the right to
freely share this information.</p>

<p>9. Changing Your Preferences</p>

<p>In certain areas of the Site, Clicksmart may give you the
opportunity to specify how certain information should be used. For example, if
you want to be removed from receiving marketing emails from us, you may reply
to any email with the word “unsubscribe” as the subject.</p>

<p>10. Cookies</p>

<p>Clicksmart uses cookies to identify you and your
preferences, to customize the site to your preferences and improve your user
experience, and to help us measure our audience and traffic patterns. Cookies
are small files that are stored on your computer that allow us to recognize you
through several visits. By default, your browser is set to accept cookies, but
if you prefer you may change your preferences to disable cookies. Companies
doing business with Clicksmart, such as advertisers or business partners, may
also place cookies on your computer. Those cookies are governed by their
privacy policies, not this one.</p>

<p>11. Children</p>

<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially
important. Clicksmart websites are not
designed to attract children and Clicksmart does not knowingly collect personal
information from children. Clicksmart
asks parents and legal guardians to assist Clicksmart by supervising the
activities of children at this web site.</p>

<p>12. Security</p>

<p>Your Clicksmart account information is password-protected
for your privacy and security. Please do not share your password with anyone. Clicksmart
will never ask you for your password. As an additional security measure,
certain areas of the Site may be protected using industry-standard
SSL-encryption to protect data as it is being transmitted.</p>
