		<h2>2. Information we receive</h2>
        <p>

            information.
        </p>        
        <p>
            <strong>Tasks</strong>.  In using Producteev, you will record tasks and store information

            <strong>Cookie Information</strong>. We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for

            to make Producteev easier to use and to protect both you and Producteev.
            For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password)
            to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to Producteev.
            We also use them to confirm that you are logged into Producteev.

        </p>

		<h2>5. How we use your information</h2>
        <p>
            We use the information we collect to try to provide a customized, safe,
            and efficient experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>To provide the service</strong>. We use the information we collect to provide our
            services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and
            features, and to provide you with customer support.
        </p>		
        <p>

            with additional offers related to Producteev.
        </p>				


		<h2>6. How we share information</h2>
        <p>
            Producteev only shares your information with third parties when we believe
            the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our
            services, or when legally required to do so. For example:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>When you make a payment</strong>. When you make payments on Producteev, we will
            share transaction information with only those third parties necessary
            to complete the transaction.  We will require those third parties to
            agree to respect the privacy of your information.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>To help improve or promote our service</strong>. Sometimes we share aggregated
            information with third parties to help improve or promote our service.
            But we only do so in such a way that no individual user can be identified
            or linked to any specific action or information.
        </p>            		
        <p>
            <strong>To provide you with services</strong>. We may provide information to service providers
            that help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use
            third parties to help host our website, send out email updates about
            Producteev, or process payments. These service providers may have access
            to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this
            occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to
            limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>To offer joint services</strong>. We may provide services jointly with other
            companies. If you use these services, we may share your information to
            facilitate that service. However, we will identify the partner and
            present the joint service provider’s privacy policy to you before you
            use that service.
        </p>

            use that service.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm</strong>. We may disclose information
            pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal
            and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is
            required by law. We may also share information when we have a good faith
            belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Transfer in the event of sale or change of control</strong>. If the ownership of
            all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your
            information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate.
            In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made
            in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <p>

            copies for up to 90 days.
        </p>		

		<h2>8. How to protect your information</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Steps we take to keep your information secure</strong>. We keep your account
            information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive
            information (such as credit card numbers and passwords), we encrypt that
            information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Risks inherent in sharing information</strong>. Although we do our best to keep
            your information secure, please be aware that no security measures are
            perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with 
            whom you share your information. We are not responsible for third party
            circumvention of security measures on Producteev. You can reduce these
            risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong
            password, using different passwords for different services, and using
            up to date antivirus software.
        </p>		

		<h2>9. Other terms</h2>

        <p>

            please do not attempt to register for Producteev or provide any personal
            information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected
            personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that
            information as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
