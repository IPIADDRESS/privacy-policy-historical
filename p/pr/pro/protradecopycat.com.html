          <p>Your  privacy is important to us. This statement outlines   our   policy on how  we manage the personal information we hold about   our   customers,  shareholders and others.<br>
            <br>
            It is  our policy to respect the confidentiality of     information and the  privacy of individuals. We are bound by the Data     Protection Principles  contained in the Data Protection Act 1998. <br>
  <br>
            Our Privacy Policy  Statement will be reviewed from time to     time to take account of new  laws and technology, changes to our     operations and practices and to  make sure it remains appropriate to the     changing environment. Any  information we hold will be governed by   our   most current Privacy Policy  Statement. <br>
            <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Why do we collect personal information?</strong> <br>
            Our  business is to meet our customers' needs for a range of     services. To do  this effectively, we need to collect certain   personal   information. <br>
  <br>
            <strong>What kind of personal information do we ask for? </strong><br>
            The type of personal information we may collect can include     (but is not limited to) name, address and contact details. <br>
  <br>
            We  obtain most of the information directly from our   customers   through  application or other forms, and from maintaining   records of   information  provided in the course of ongoing customer   service. We may   also obtain  information from other sources. <br>
  <br>
            We may ask for other  information voluntarily from time to     time (for example, through market  research, surveys or special offers)     to enable us to improve our  service or consider the wider needs of   our   customers or potential  customers. <br>
  <br>
            If you choose not to provide the information we  need to     fulfil your request for a specific product or service, we may  not be     able to provide you with the requested product or service. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How do we use this information and who may we disclose it to?</strong> <br>
            While  we may send you marketing material from time to time     that we think will  be useful to you, we are conscious of the need to     respect your privacy. <br>
  <br>
            Unless you are informed otherwise, the personal information   we    hold is used for establishing and managing your account, reviewing     your  ongoing needs, enhancing customer service and products and   giving   you  ongoing information or opportunities that we believe may   be   relevant to  you. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Management of personal information</strong> <br>
            We  train our employees who handle personal information to     respect the  confidentiality of customer information and the privacy of     individuals.  We regard breaches of your privacy very seriously and   will   impose  appropriate penalties, including dismissal. <br>
  <br>
            We have an  appointed Privacy Officer to ensure that our     management of personal  information is in accordance with this statement     and the Privacy Act. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How do we store personal information?</strong> <br>
            Safeguarding  the privacy of your information is important   to   us, whether you  interact with us personally, by phone, mail, over   the   internet or other  electronic medium. We hold personal information   in a   combination of  secure computer storage facilities and   paper-based files   and other  records, and take steps to protect the   personal information   we hold  from misuse, loss, unauthorised access,   modification or   disclosure. <br>
  <br>
            We  may need to maintain records for a significant period of     time. However,  when we consider information is no longer needed, we     will remove any  details that will identify you or we will securely     destroy the records. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How do we keep personal information accurate and up-to-date?</strong> <br>
            We  endeavour to ensure that the personal information we   hold   is accurate  and up-to-date. We realise that this information   changes   frequently  with changes of address and other personal   circumstances. We   can  generally update your customer information over   the telephone. <br>
  <br>
            You have the right to check what personal information about you is held by us <br>
  <br>
            Under  the Data Protection Act, you have the right to obtain   a   copy of any  personal information which we hold about you and to   advise   us of any  perceived inaccuracy. The Act does set out some   exceptions   to this. <br>
            <br>
            To make a request, please write to us, verifying your identity and specifying what information you require. <br>
  <br>
            We  may charge a fee to cover the cost of verifying the     application and  locating, retrieving, reviewing and copying any     material requested. We  will acknowledge your request and respond to it     within 40 days of  receipt of your application and any applicable fee. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What if you have a complaint?</strong> <br>
            If  you consider that any action of of ours breaches this     Privacy Policy  Statement or the Data Protection Principles or otherwise     doesn't  respect your privacy, you can make a complaint. This will be     acted upon  promptly. Please visit our Contact Us page - link at the bottom of this page - to do so.<br>
