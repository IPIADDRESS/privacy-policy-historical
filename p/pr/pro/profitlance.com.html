      forth the ProfitLance.Com Online Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") for 
      this Web site, http://www.ProfitLance.Com (the "Site"). If you have 
      objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Site.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Changes in Privacy Policy</b><br>
      All "personal information" ("personal information" is defined as any 
      information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate 
      the person to whom such information pertains) that we collect and maintain 
      will be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time 
      of such collection. ProfitLance.Com reserves the right to change the 
      Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion, and will provide 
      notice of material changes on the home page of the Site. If as the result 
      of such changes, you want to alter the ways in which ProfitLance.Com is 
      allowed to use your personal information, you can do so by following the 
      procedure described below in the section titled "Updating your personal 
      information and privacy preferences." You will be deemed to have been made 
      aware of, and will be subject to, the changes to the Privacy Policy by 
      your continued use of the Site after such notice has been posted for 
      thirty (30) days with the following exception: If at the time you provide 
      personal information to ProfitLance.Com you are given the opportunity (as 
      you currently are) to limit how such information will be used to 
      communicate with you, either by ProfitLance.Com or by third parties, 
      ProfitLance.Com will not change your preference in this regard without 
      your express consent. However, if ProfitLance.Com sells assets (or the 
      assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or ProfitLance.Com 
      (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another 
      entity, ProfitLance.Com may provide to such entity customer information 
      that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged 
      with the other entity without your consent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Entities collecting personal information</b><br>
      Personal information on this Site is collected by ProfitLance.Com.<br>
      <br>
      The Site contains links to other sites at which personal information is 
      collected. In such instances, unless expressly provided to the contrary, 
      the collection and use of your personal information will be governed by 
      the privacy policy applicable to that site. That privacy policy should 
      identify the entity that is collecting your personal information.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Collection of personal information</b><br>
      As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without 
      providing any personal information. In connection with other activities, 
      such as subscribing to the collaboration services offered on the Site or 
      utilizing online software applications, ProfitLance.Com may ask you to 
      provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting 
      an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these 
      activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, 
      ProfitLance.Com may ask that you provide us personal information, such as 
      your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail 
      address, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile 
      numbers, and other personal information. When ordering products or 
      services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. 
      Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to 
      provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not 
      provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will 
      not be able to engage in that activity.<br>
      <br>
      When you use the Site, ProfitLance.Com or third parties authorized by 
      ProfitLance.Com may also collect certain technical and routing information 
      about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. 
      For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, 
      operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of 
      your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and 
      track your use of the Site and its services. ProfitLance.Com also uses 
      such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. 
      Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do not 
      match such information with any of your personal information.<br>
      <br>
      When you submit personal information to ProfitLance.Com through this Site, 
      you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across 
      national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the 
      countries in which ProfitLance.Com and its affiliates and subsidiaries 
      maintain offices, including, without limitation, the United States. You 
      also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain 
      activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your 
      information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of ProfitLance.Com. Such 
      vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for 
      their own purposes or provide it to any third parties. One instance where 
      this could occur is in conjunction with framed pages in which the URL for 
      the pages is not visible and the pages are being hosted by a vendor of 
      ProfitLance.Com.<br>
      <br>
      ProfitLance.Com has established relationships with various service 
      providers whose services are available to you from this Site or from Web 
      sites that are linked to this Site. Typically, these providers offer 
      services that ProfitLance.Com customers might find useful, such as those 
      that can be used in conjunction with ProfitLance.Com services and 
      products. In order to use those services, you may be required to provide 
      personal information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the 
      contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a 
      provider's Web site will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such 
      site, and personal information that you provide while on this Site in 
      conjunction with a provider's service will be subject to this Privacy 
      Policy. You should be aware that our agreements with these service 
      providers often provide that they will share with ProfitLance.Com personal 
      information collected from you. In such instances, ProfitLance.Com may use 
      this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In the 
      situation where sites have an ProfitLance.Com "look and feel," and you 
      reasonably believe you are on an ProfitLance.Com site, the site is 
      collecting information in a solely intermediary capacity and does not use 
      personal information for secondary purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>How your personal information is used </b><br>
      ProfitLance.Com collects your information in order to record and support 
      your participation in the activities you select. <br>
      <br>
      ProfitLance.Com may collect information about the use of the Site, such as 
      the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This 
      information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user 
      individually. ProfitLance.Com may use this aggregate, non-identifying 
      statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar 
      promotional purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Your choices with respect to personal information </b><br>
      ProfitLance.Com recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible 
      use of information collected on this Site. Without your consent, 
      ProfitLance.Com will not communicate any information to you regarding 
      products, services, and special offers available from ProfitLance.Com, 
      although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your 
      use of the services on this Site. Except in the particular circumstances 
      described in this Privacy Policy, ProfitLance.Com will also not provide 
      your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.<br>
      <br>
      There are other instances in which ProfitLance.Com may divulge your 
      personal information. ProfitLance.Com may provide your personal 
      information if necessary, in ProfitLance.Com's good faith judgment, to 
      comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or regulatory body or in 
      response to a valid subpoena, warrant, or order or to protect the rights 
      of ProfitLance.Com or others. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Protection of your personal information </b><br>
      The personal information that you provide in connection with registering 
      yourself as a user of ProfitLance.Com products or services or registering 
      an ProfitLance.Com product is classified as Registration Information. 
      Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to 
      your Registration Information is available through a password and unique 
      customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that 
      you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your Registration 
      Information resides on a secure server that only selected ProfitLance.Com 
      personnel and contractors have access to via password. ProfitLance.Com 
      encrypts your personal information and thereby strives to prevent 
      unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted 
      to ProfitLance.Com.<br>
      <br>
      Personal information that you provide that does not constitute 
      Registration Information also resides on a secure server and is only 
      accessible to selected ProfitLance.Com personnel and contractors via 
      password. Since this information is not accessible by you, you will not be 
      asked to select a password in order to view or modify such information.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Use of cookies </b><br>
      When you visit this Site, you can browse the Site and access important 
      information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our Site, 
      we use "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is a small amount of data 
      that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read 
      by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification 
      card, and enables ProfitLance.Com to record your passwords, purchases, and 
      preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.<br>
      <br>
      Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your 
      browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to 
      decide whether to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an 
      authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept 
      cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)<br>
      <br>
      While ProfitLance.Com uses cookies to track your visit to ProfitLance.Com, 
      and our Web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your 
      computer, ProfitLance.Com does not use this information to identify you 
      personally.<br>
      <br>
      Updating your personal information and privacy preferences<br>
      You have the right to access and correct your personal information and 
      privacy preferences at any time. With respect to Registration Information, 
      this may be accomplished by linking to your account at Edit Your Account, 
      where you can view and make changes to your personal information. You may 
      also access and correct your personal information and privacy preferences 
      (such as whether you wish to receive promotional communications from 
      ProfitLance.Com or third parties) by writing ProfitLance.Com at:</font></p>
