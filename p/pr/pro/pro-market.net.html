									<font class="textTitle">What is Pro-Market and the Universal Profile Bank (UPB)?</font><br><br>
									AlmondNet's patent-pending Pro-Market serves as the infrastructure for the AlmondNet solution by allowing advertisements to reach their target audience based on selected attributes chosen by the advertiser.  Pro-Market allows advertisers to reach their target audience through precision targeting, with a built in flexibility that allows for real-time budget re-allocation, instantaneous campaign launch and immediate feedback.  Pro-Market helps to facilitate an efficient match between buyers and sellers of anonymous profile-based ad space.<br><br>
									AlmondNet's patent-pending Universal Profile Bank (UPB) supports the Pro-Market technology and further enables advertisers to reach their target audience through the use of anonymous profiles.  The Universal Profile Bank builds anonymous visitor profiles with accurate attributes acquired from reliable sources and uses those profiles in order to serve advertisements to web users through Pro-Market technology.<br><br><br>
									<font class="textTitle">What information does Pro-Market and the Universal Profile Bank collect?</font><br><br>
									Neither Pro-Market nor the UPB collect or store personally identifiable information, such as one's name, email address or mailing address, from individuals passing through the AlmondNet system.  Pro-Market and the UPB, however, do collect certain types of anonymous information, i.e., information that is non-personally identifiable and cannot be associated with any individual. Pro-Market and the UPB collect non-personally identifiable information from visitors in order to build what AlmondNet refers to as web user profiles, which in turn are used to serve targeted advertisements.
