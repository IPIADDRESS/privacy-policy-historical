HP and its subsidiaries respect your privacy.  This Privacy Statement informs you of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online and how that information is used. This statement is readily available on our home page and at the bottom of every HP Web page. Some HP Web pages are <a class="udrline" href="/country/us/en/privacy/p3p_popup.html">P3P-enabled</a>, which allows you additional control over your personal information.&nbsp;<br><br>
				HP is a founding sponsor of the Council of Better Business Bureau's <a class="udrline" href="http://www.bbbonline.org/"> BBBOnLine</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbbonline.org/"><img height="13" alt="non-HP site" width="14" border="0" src="http://welcome.hp-ww.com/img/hpweb_1-2_exit.gif"></a> Privacy Program for privacy certification. HP privacy practices meet the requirements of the Privacy Program and we are proud to display the BBBOnLine Privacy Seal.

    <p>HP has also self-certified its privacy practices as consistent with U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor principles: Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Access and Accuracy, Security, and Oversight/Enforcement. More information about the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program can be found at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" class="udrline">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>&nbsp; <a class="udrline" href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/"><img height="13" alt="non-HP site" width="14" border="0" src="http://welcome.hp-ww.com/img/hpweb_1-2_exit.gif"></a>.<br>

    HP is a licensee of the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal  Program. TRUSTe is a worldwide, independent, non-profit organization whose  mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting  the use of fair information practices. Because HP wants to demonstrate its  commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices  and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.<br>

    The TRUSTe program only covers the information  that is collected through the Web site at <a class="udrline" href="http://www.hp.com/">www.hp.com</a> and <a class="udrline" href="http://www.hewlettpackard.com/">www.hewlettpackard.com</a>. The  TRUSTe program <strong>does not</strong> cover  information that may be collected through any software downloaded from this Web  site.<strong></strong><br>
      <br>
    If you have questions or concerns regarding  this statement, you should first contact HP using the contact information  included at the end of this statement.

This Privacy Statement applies to all HP-owned websites and domains and the websites and domains of our wholly owned subsidiaries ("HP website"), except that a privacy policy or statement posted on HP websites specific to a particular HP program or service will apply instead of this Privacy Statement. <a href="" class="udrline"></a>&nbsp;<p>

                    <p>To serve you better and  understand your needs and interests, HP collects, exports, and uses personal  information with adequate notice and consent, along with required filings with  data protection authorities, when applicable. For  example, when you order products or services, apply for instant credit,  request information, subscribe to marketing or support materials, register  yourself or your HP products, enter contests or participate in surveys, or  apply for a job at HP, we will ask you to provide personal information to  complete these transactions. The types of personal information you provide to  us on these pages may include contact information such as your name, address,  telephone number, and email address; financial information such as your credit  card number; and other unique information such as user IDs and passwords,  billing and transaction information, product and service preferences, contact  preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data. If  you apply for instant credit, we will ask you to provide additional sensitive personal  information such as salary, Social Security number and banking information.  This information will be used by our financial services providers in  determining whether to extend you credit. <br>
                      <br>
                      If you choose to use a tell-a-friend program on our site, we will ask you  for your friend’s e-mail address and automatically send your friend a one-time  e-mail inviting your friend to visit the site. HP uses  and stores this  information only for the purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and to provide  tell-a-friend message blocking, where available.<br>
                      <br>
                  In addition to the information you provide, HP may also collect information  during your visit to an HP website through our Automatic Data Collection Tools,  which include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, and other commonly used  information-gathering tools. These tools collect certain standard information  that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language,  access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at an HP  website. They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP)  address, clickstream behavior (i.e. the pages you view, the links you click,  and other actions you take in connection with HP websites) and product  information. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your  computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and  identify your computer. Computers use IP addresses to communicate on the  Internet, allowing users to browse and shop. HP may also use some of these  Automatic Data Collection Tools in connection with certain emails sent from HP  and therefore may collect information using these tools when you open the email  or click on a link contained in the email. To learn more, read&nbsp;<a class="udrline" href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/privacy/cookies_beacons.html">How HP  uses automatic data collection tools</a>. </p>
                    HP also collects information from commercially  available sources that it deems credible. Such information may include your  name, address, email address and demographic data. The information HP collects  from its commercial sources may be used along with the information HP collects  when you visit HP’s websites. For example, HP may compare the geographic  information acquired from commercial sources with the IP address collected by  Automatic Data Collection Tools to derive your general geographic area. &nbsp;

                    <p>HP will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to  others except as described in this Statement. HP shares personal information in  the following ways:</p>
                  <p>HP retains service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products,  services and customer solutions and to assist HP with marketing and  communication initiatives. These providers and suppliers include, for example, credit  card processors, providers of customer support and live-help, email service  providers, automated data processors, and shipping agents. Suppliers and  service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information  received on behalf of HP and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry  out the services they are performing for HP. </p>
	<p>From time to time, HP participates in marketing initiatives with other  companies. As part of these initiatives, certain HP services and marketing  communications are delivered at the same time as those from other companies.  Some of these services and communications offer you the option to share  personal information with both HP and the other companies participating in  these initiatives. For example, you may receive marketing communications from  HP and other companies or have the opportunity to register online for software  products from multiple companies. If you choose to provide personal information  only to HP, HP will not share this information with the other companies  participating in that marketing initiative. If you choose to provide personal  information to the other companies, that personal information will be handled  according to the privacy policy of those companies.	</p>
	<p>HP will require the  export of your personal information to other HP-owned business entities in the US and Worldwide in accordance with  this Statement to satisfy your request.&nbsp;Such export is a requirement of  providing the information to HP.<br>
	    <br>
	      Except as described in this Statement, HP will not share the personal  information you provide to HP with non-HP third parties without your  permission, unless to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of police  and governmental authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena,  or court order; (iii) help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights  and properties of HP or its subsidiaries; or (iv) protect the personal safety  of HP employees and third parties on HP property. <br>
Circumstances may arise where, whether for  strategic or other business reasons, HP decides to sell, buy, merge or  otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may  involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual  purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is HP’s practice to seek  appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

HP gives you the choice of receiving a variety of information that complements our products and services. You can subscribe to receive certain product- and service-specific information and also choose to receive HP general communications.  We give you a choice regarding delivery of HP general communications by postal mail, email and telephone. 
	<p>You can make or change your choices about receiving either subscription or  general communications at the data collection point or by using other methods,  which are listed in the following sections. This option does not apply to  communications primarily for the purpose of administering order completion,  contracts, support, product safety warnings, driver updates, or other  administrative and transactional notices as the primary purpose of these  communications is not promotional in nature. </p>
	<p>The email communications that you receive from HP will be provided in 
	accordance with this statement. Some email communications may utilize 
	automatic data collection tools. To learn more, read  
	<a class="udrline" href="/country/us/en/privacy/cookies_beacons.html">How HP uses automatic data collection tools</a>.	</p>
	<p></p><h3 class="bold">Subscription communications </h3>
	<p>Subscription communications include email newsletters,  software updates, etc. that may be expressly requested by you or which you  consented to receive. After you request such communications, you may opt out of  receiving them by using one of the following methods: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Select the email "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each subscription communication.	</li>
	<li>Return to the Web page(s) where you originally registered your preferences and follow the opt-out instructions. Access to many HP subscriptions is available at the 
	<a class="udrline" href="http://www.hp.com/united-states/subscribe/gateway/">Subscriber’s Choice web page</a>.	</li>
	<li>Write to the 
	<a class="udrline" href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/privacy/privacy_contact.html">HP Privacy Office</a>. Be sure to provide your name, email and postal address, and specific relevant information about the HP subscriptions that you no longer wish to receive.	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Please be aware that when you opt out of receiving certain subscription communications, it may affect the services you have chosen to receive from HP where accepting the communications is a condition of receiving the services.                    </p>

HP general communications provide information about products, services, and/or support. This may include new product information, special offers, or invitations to participate in market research.  
	<p>You will often be able to use 
	<a class="udrline" href="https://passport2.hp.com/hpp/priprefs.do?s_lang=en&amp;hpappid=privacy">HP Passport</a> to indicate whether you want to receive general communications from HP. HP Passport is a single-login service that lets you register with HP Passport-enabled websites using a single-user identifier and password of your choice. HP Passport uses cookies to store your basic personal information so you don't have to retype it when you return to one of HP's many websites in the future. HP Passport also allows you to set your privacy preferences. Your preferences will apply across HP websites, email, and other communication vehicles that use HP Passport.<br>
	<br> 
	If you are unable to use HP Passport, you may opt out of receiving these general communications by using one of the following methods:	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Select the email "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each communication.	</li>
	<li>Write to the 
	<a class="udrline" href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/privacy/privacy_contact.html">HP Privacy Office</a>. Be sure to provide your name, email and postal address, and specific relevant information about your privacy preferences.

HP takes seriously the trust you place in us. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, HP utilizes appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect.

	<p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption  when collecting or transferring sensitive information such as credit card  information. SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by  anyone but us. This security measure is working when you see the symbol of  either an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser) at the  bottom of your browser window.</p>
	<p>Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments and are not used for other purposes. As part of real-time payment processing, HP subscribes to a fraud management service. This service gives you and HP an extra level of security to guard against credit card fraud and to protect your financial data.
