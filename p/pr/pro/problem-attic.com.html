          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Problem-Attic is a web-based program developed by EducAide Software. We are pleased to make the program available to everyone in the educational community: teachers, homeschoolers, tutors, researchers, parents and students.</p>
          <p>Because of the wide appeal of Problem-Attic and its many possible uses (classroom instruction, assessment, personalized learning), you should carefully read this Privacy Policy and related <a href="terms">Terms of Service</a> to see what rules govern your particular situation. If you do not agree with the rules, then you must not make any further use of Problem-Attic.</p>
          <h2>Collection of Information</h2>
          <p>EducAide Software (hereinafter “EAS”) collects and stores certain types of personal information, as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>To use the main features of Problem-Attic (the “Program”), you need to create an account. If you choose to do so, then EAS will ask for your first and last name and your personal email address.  Also, EAS will require you to confirm your address through an email that we send you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>After creating an account, you may use the features of the Program that are freely-available without providing EAS any additional personal information; however, you may voluntarily provide other information to EAS through separate communications, such as a request for technical support, or EAS may ask for more information in order to respond to such a request.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If you create an account, then EAS will collect information about any documents that you create.  This includes, among other things, the problems you have chosen, your page header and formatting options, and whether you create/download a PDF version of a document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Regardless of whether you create an account, EAS will collect information about your general use of the Program, such as the pages you visit and whether you have taken the Problem-Attic Tour.  EducAide will also collect details that are publicly-available about your web browser and computer, such as IP address, operating system, and browser type and version.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Safeguarding and Use of Information</h2>
          <p>The information collected by EAS will be stored securely on EAS’s or other host servers. (EducAide uses some third-party vendors to provide hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technologies required to run the Program. See <a href="terms">Terms of Service</a> for more details.)</p>
          <p>The information collected by EAS will <em>not</em> be sold, traded, bartered, given away, or used for solication by a third-party without your explicit permission.</p>
          <p>EAS may use the information it collects to improve Program performance and quality of service, to study operation of the Program and user preferences, and to notify you of changes to the Program, including service interruptions, bugfixes, new features, or changes to <a href="terms">Terms of Service</a> or this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>EAS may share information it collects with any agent or direct affiliate, such as a content- or application-development partner or company hired by EAS to assist with emails, newsletters, marketing, and other customer and public relations activities.</p>
          <p>EAS may share the information it collects with third-parties, as EAS deems necessary, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving threats to another person, violations of <a href="terms">Terms of Service</a>, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, which a web server sends to your browser and which gets saved on your local hard drive.  In order to use the Program, you may need to change your browser settings so that it can save cookies.</p>
          <p>EAS uses cookies to record current session information, to track usage of the Program, and at your option to store login information.</p>
          <p>EAS does not put any cookies on your computer that track web-browsing activities or track sites that you visit after using the Program.</p>
          <h2>Changes</h2>
          <p>EAS reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time.  If we make any significant changes, we will notify you by email (using the address you supplied when you created an account), and we will announce the changes on the Problem-Attic website and on your document home page, which you see after creating an account and logging in.  It then becomes your responsibility to review the changes and decide if you agree with them. If you do not, then you must discontinue use of the Program.</p>
