				Workflow

Workflow is the operational aspect of a work procedure: how tasks are structured, who performs them, what their relative order is, how they are synchronized, how information flows to support the tasks and how tasks are being tracked. As the dimension of time is considered in Workflow, Workflow considers "throughput" as a distinct measure. Workflow problems can be modeled and analyzed using Petri nets.

While the concept of workflow is not specific to information technology, support for workflow is an integral part of groupware software.

Distinction can be made between "scientific" and "business" workflow paradigms. While the former is mostly concerned with throughput of data through various algorithms, applications and services, the latter concentrates on scheduling task executions, ensuring dependencies which are not necessarily data-driven and may include human agents.

Scientific workflows found wide acceptance in the fields of bioinformatics and cheminformatics in the early 2000s, where they successfully met the need for multiple interconnected tools, handling of multiple data formats and large data quantities. Also, the paradigm of scientific workflows was close to the well-established tradition of Perl scripting in life-science research organization, so this adoption represented a natural step forward towards a more structured infrastructure setup.

Business workflows are more generic, being able to represent any structuring of tasks, and are equally applicable to task scheduling within a software application server and organizing a paper document trail within an organization. Their origins date back to the 1970s, when they were purely paper-based, and the principles from that period made the transition to modern IT infrastructure systems.

As a way of bridging the gap between the two, significant effort is being put into defining workflow patterns that can be used to compare and contrast different workflow engines across both of these domains.

Workflow systems

Workflow diagram systems are defined as "systems that help organizations to specify, execute, monitor, and coordinate the flow of work cases within a distributed office environment". Workflow diagrams rely on the use of standardized graphical notations to describe workflow structures. The Business Process Modeling Notation is an example of this system.

The system contains two basic components: first component is the workflow modeling component (sometimes called the specification module or the build time system), which enables administrations and analysts to define process and activities, analyze and simulate them, and assign them to people. The second component is the workflow execution component, sometimes called the run-time system. It consists of the execution interface seen by end-users and the workflow engine, an execution environment which assists in coordination and performing the processes and activities.

Business Process Management
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
Jump to: navigation, search

The term Business Process Management (or BPM) refers to a set of activities which organizations can perform to either optimize their business processes or adapt them to new organizational needs. As these activities are usually aided by software tools, the term BPM is synonymously used to refer to the software tools themselves.

Although it can be said that organizations have been performing BPM for some time, a new impetus has been given to the theme with the advent of software tools (business process management systems or BPMS) which allow for the direct execution of the business processes without a costly and time intensive development of the required software. In addition, these tools can also monitor the execution of the business processes, providing the management of an organization the means to analyze their performance and make changes to the original processes with the aim of improving them. Using the BPMS the modified processes can then be quickly placed into operation.

Business Process Management encompases other process elements, such as Total Quality Management (TQM), Six Sigma, Performance Management, etc.. Where Business Process Reengineering (popular in the 1990s) dealt with one-off changes to the organization, Business Process Management deals much more with the continuity and embedding of process-thinking and doing in the organization. Business Process Management is not about technology but about management.
