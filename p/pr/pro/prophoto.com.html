<h3>Log Data</h3>
<p>Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site (“Log Data”).&nbsp;This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,&nbsp;browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit,&nbsp;the time spent on those pages and other statistics.</p>
