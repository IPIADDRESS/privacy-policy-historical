        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">The privacy of   your personally-identifiable information is important to us. As part of our   commitment to the privacy of your personally-identifiable information, we   provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices   you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this   notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point   where personally-identifiable information may be requested. </p>
        <p align="left" class="heading2">The Information   We Collect </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">In general, when   you visit our Web site you remain anonymous, but on some pages, you need to   provide personally-identifiable information to order products and contact   Mitchell 1. The types of personally-identifiable information collected at these   pages include: </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">Name <br>
          Company <br>
          Customer Number <br>
          Address <br>
          City <br>
          State/Province <br>
          Zip Code/Postal   Code <br>
          Country <br>
          Email Address <br>
          Phone Number <br>
          Fax Number <br>
          Credit/Debit Card/Procurement Card Information </p>
        <p align="left" class="heading2">The Way We Use   Information </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">We   use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete   that order or to provide a more personalized shopping experience. We do not and   will not share this information with third parties other than Mitchell 1's   affiliates except to the extent necessary to complete that order. We maintain   credit/debit card/procurement card information only until payment for your order   is processed unless you authorize the information to be stored for future   visits. If you later decide that you do not want us to store such information,   you may contact us at <a href="mailto:CustomerSupport@mitchell1.com">CustomerSupport@mitchell1.com</a> and ask us to delete such information. </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">We   also use return email addresses and customer addresses which you provide to us   when placing an order or accessing this website to answer the email and   correspondence we receive, confirm your order, send renewal notices, notify you   of important changes in the functionality of the web site, update you on new   products, and communicate special offers we think you might be interested in.   Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with third   parties. If you do not want to receive this information in the future, please   contact us at <a href="mailto:CustomerSupport@mitchell1.com">CustomerSupport@mitchell1.com.</a></p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">We   use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site and   gather information for product management and development at Mitchell 1. For   example, we may tell our sales and marketing staff that X number of individuals   visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of software licenses   were ordered during a particular time period, but we would not disclose anything   that could be used to identify those individuals. This information may also be   shared with Mitchell affiliates. </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">Finally, we will not use or share the   personally-identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to   the ones described above without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out   or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. </p>
        <p align="left" class="heading2">Our Commitment to   Data Security </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">We have put in   place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure   the information we collect online. </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">When you place   orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server.   The secure server software receives encrypted information through the Secure   Sockets Layer (SSL) of your internet browser which encrypts the information you   input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, we have taken appropriate safeguards   to protect customer data against unauthorized access. </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">We make limited   use of cookies on this site. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are   stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. The only purpose for which   we use cookies is to keep track of items ordered during your current shopping   session in our Product Catalog. This is necessary to facilitate a streamlined   checkout process. </p>
        <p align="left" class="heading2">Our Commitment to   Children's Privacy </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">Protecting the   privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never   collect or maintain information at our Web site from those we actually know are   under 13, and no part of our Web site is structured to attract anyone under 13.   Any parent or guardian that learns that their child may have submitted   personally-identifiable information should contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:CustomerSupport@mitchell1.com">CustomerSupport@mitchell1.com</a>. </p>
        <p align="left" class="heading2">How You Can   Access or Correct Your Information </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">You can access   and correct all your personally-identifiable information that we collect online   and maintain by clicking on Your Account and entering your user id and password.   You are solely responsible for the maintenance and security of your user id and   password. For other questions related to updating or changing your account   information, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:CustomerSupport@mitchell1.com">CustomerSupport@mitchell1.com</a>.   We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy" style="">If any errors in   your personally identifiable information cannot be corrected by accessing Your   Account, please contact us using the contact information below. </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">To protect your   privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity   before granting access or making corrections. </p>
        <p align="left" class="heading2">Opportunity to   Opt Out </p>
        <p align="left" class="bodycopy">At any time you   can contact us using the information below to ask us to remove your   personally-identifiable information from our records, electronic or otherwise. </p>
