  </strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong>5.1.</strong> The primary use for Your information is to provide You with services You have requested and/or paid for. We also use Your information to deliver customized services to You. Non-personal and aggregate information, such as that collected passively is used in order to improve User experience or to customize the use of Our Site for an aggregate group of customers.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong>5.2.</strong> We generally will use Your information for the purposes for which You specifically provide it, for example, to ensure payment for subscription or other services, if applicable. We also use Your information for market research purposes – in order to increase Your (and other Users’) experience according to tracked interests, to analyze and target potential new markets, and for other marketing/statistical purposes.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong>5.3.</strong> We may provide, at Our sole discretion, Your registration information to third parties as a means of marketing and/or advertising.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong class="turquoise">6) SPECIAL CASES</strong><br>
    It is Our policy not to use or share the personal information about Browsers or Members in ways unrelated to those described in this Policy without also providing You an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, We may disclose personal information about Browsers or Members, or information regarding Your use of the Services or websites accessible through Our Services, for any reason if, in Our sole discretion, We believe that it is reasonable to do so, including, but not limited to:<br>
    </p>
  <p align="center"><strong>6.1.</strong> To satisfy any laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such information;<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong>6.2.</strong> To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Our User Agreement or other User policies;<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong>6.3.</strong> To operate Our Services properly;<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong>6.4.</strong> To protect Ourselves, Our Members, and the general public. We will always cooperate with law enforcement authorities when legally compelled to do so. We specifically reserve the right to disclose any and all information to law enforcement in the event that a crime is committed, is suspected, or if We are compelled to do so by lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong>6.5.</strong> Private-party litigants, governmental administrative or regulatory agencies, and investigative reporters or journalists will not be cooperated with unless We have been legally advised to do so..<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong>6.6.</strong> If We have reason to believe that the User is not the owner of a credit card, even if the credit card use is authorized, We will provide information about You to the credit card holder. We will absolutely provide Your information to the credit card holder if We believe that fraud is a possibility. However, We do not require that there be fraud, as it is Our policy that the credit card holder always has an absolute right to access any and all of Your personal information.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong class="turquoise">7) TRANSMITTALS FROM US</strong><br>
    We may send You periodic announcements including the details of Our existing and new programs. You may opt out of these announcements by contacting support@projectvoyeur.com or by clicking the opt-out link at the bottom of these emails, if applicable. If You opt out of these marketing emails, You may still receive system notices and other information that is specifically related to Your account. For example, We may send You messages in response to a lost password request, when other members contact You via the Site’s services, or for other reasons associated with the features of the Site.<br>
    If You provide Your information to Us, use the Site, or subscribe to any of Our services, You will have created a commercial relationship with Us. In having done so, You understand that even unsolicited commercial email sent from Us or Our affiliates is not SPAM as that term is defined under the law.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong class="turquoise">8) OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY.</strong><br>
    We take various measures to protect the transmission of all sensitive end-User information. We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of Our network and systems by storing User data in an secure encrypted network database. We do not have access to this data unless requested by authorized personnel for specific legal or billing reasons. Only Your provided name and email address will be retained in-house for confirmation purposes. Nevertheless, We cannot guarantee that Our security measures will prevent third-party ‘hackers’ from illegally obtaining this information. We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals We are unable to guarantee that Our security is 100% breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite Our reasonable security measures.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong class="turquoise">9) HOW TO ACCESS OR MODIFY YOUR INFORMATION.</strong><br>
