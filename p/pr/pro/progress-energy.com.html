<p>Progress Energy understands your concerns about the use of your personal information online and is committed to maintaining high standards for the protection of your privacy.&nbsp; This notice explains Progress Energy's online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.</p>

<p><strong>How Progress Energy Protects Your Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>Progress Energy uses industry-standard encryption technologies to secure and protect your personal information.&nbsp; As an added level of security, several online forms on this Website utilize Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") when transmitting and receiving data.&nbsp; SSL helps prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintains data accuracy and ensures the appropriate use of information.&nbsp; SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data before it is transmitted over an Internet connection.&nbsp; Both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator support SSL.&nbsp; Unfortunately, no security system is fail-safe, and Progress Energy cannot guarantee the information you provide will never be obtained by unauthorized persons.</p>

<p>To protect information off-line, access to the information you provide is limited to those employees who specifically need it to conduct their business responsibilities.&nbsp; Your information is stored on secure servers protected inside controlled facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Why We Collect Information</strong></p>

<p>In general, you are not required to register or provide personally identifiable information in order to view much of this Website.&nbsp; Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Statement, we limit the collection of personally identifiable information to what is needed to administer accounts, provide customer service, offer products and services and process online employment applications.&nbsp; For example, if you choose to use online customer services, including account access, e-bill and product or service enrollment, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information, which may include your account number, name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address.&nbsp; You may be asked to submit additional personal or financial information in order to use certain specific services offered in these customer account transaction areas.&nbsp; If you choose not to provide this information, we may not be able to provide you with the requested service or complete your transaction.</p>

</i>Progress Energy and its subsidiaries do not sell, rent or lease to others your personally identifiable information without your consent.&nbsp; Absent your consent, Progress Energy will share the personal data you provide only with other Progress Energy subsidiaries and affiliates and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf.&nbsp; In addition, we may make information available to third-parties and/or service providers who are providing the product(s), service(s) or information you requested.&nbsp; For example, we may share billing and collection information about you for a home appliance warranty service with the third-party providing such service if we bill you for this service as part of the monthly statement that you receive from us.<br>
