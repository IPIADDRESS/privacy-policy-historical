      <p><b>Your California Privacy Rights</b></p>

      <p></p><p>Informed Consent to Be Contacted by Telephone</p>
      By registering on the Site, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR § 310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the "Rule") and applicable state do-not-call regulations. As such, notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we (and the Partners) retain the right to contact you via telemarketing (where you supply your telephone number to us) in accordance with the Rule and applicable state do-not-call regulations.

      <p>In addition, where you provide "prior express written consent" within the meaning of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 USC § 227), and its implementing regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (47 CFR § 64.1200), as amended from time-to-time ("TCPA"), you consent to receive telephone calls, including artificial voice and pre-recordeded messages and/or calls delivered via automated technology, to the telephone number(s) that you provided. You understand and agree that this consent applies even if your telephone number is a wireless number. You further acknowledge and agree that you are not required to consent to the above stated terms to gain access to the One on One Offerings.</p>

      <p><b>Collection of Anonymous Information and Cookies</b></p>
      <p>If you do not provide us any of your Personal Information, we are limited in the information that we may collect from you. For example, we may be able to determine your IP address when you access the Site for the purposes of administering the One on One Offerings and tracking One on One Offerings usage. However, your IP address may vary each time you visit the Site or it may remain the same depending on the type of Internet connection you are using or the location from which you access the Site.
