  <li>to <strong>our subsidiaries</strong> who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of our Services);</li>

In addition, Advertisers use technologies (such as cookies, pixels, and Web beacons) to collect information about your browsing behavior on our Sites and via our Services which they may match with information they have previously collected (including personally identifiable information you have provided to them). Our Privacy Notice does not cover any use of information that Advertisers may collect from you or that you choose to provide to them.

<p>Please be aware that whenever you share information on a publicly available page or any other public forum on the Sites or Services, others may access that information. In addition, please remember that when you share information in any other communications with third parties, that information may be passed along or made public by others. This means that anyone with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications.</p>

<h3 id="security">SECURITY</h3>
<p>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information and other information transmitted to us. For example, we control physical building access and monitor our offices with video surveillance; authorized staff utilize multi-factor authentication mechanisms to access development and engineering locations; and we have implemented security training for all new employees. However, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Sites or Services, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Sites or Services, and you do so at your own risk. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us using the information provided in the "<a href="#contact">How to Contact Us</a>" section below.</p>

<h3 id="children">CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h3>
<p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.</p>

<h3 id="international">INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h3>
<p>Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are a resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). Specifically, our Sites and Services are hosted in the United States and our group companies and third-party service providers operate around the world.</p>
<p>However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. Procore participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.</p>

<h4>Privacy Shield</h4>
<p>Procore participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Procore is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework's applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Commerce</a>.</p>
<p>Procore is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Procore complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Procore is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Procore may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge).</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on privacyshield.gov/welcome, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>

<h3 id="eea">LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EEA VISITORS ONLY)</h3>
<p>If you are a visitor from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>
<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, or for more details on our legitimate interests, please contact us using the contact details provided in the "<a href="#contact">How to Contact Us</a>" section below.</p>
<p>See section below entitled "<a href="#privacy">Privacy for Procore Platform Users</a>." In most cases Procore is acting on the instructions of its Clients, who determine the legal basis.</p>

<h3 id="retention">DATA RETENTION</h3>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or where we have an ongoing business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable, legal, tax, or accounting requirements). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<h3 id="rights">YOUR RIGHTS</h3>
<p>Upon request Procore will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. You can always review, correct, delete or update your Personal Information by changing the relevant settings in your Procore account or by emailing us. We will respond to your request at the latest within a month.</p>
<p>You can opt out of receiving certain emails by changing notification settings on the Sites or in our applications, clicking the unsubscribe link provided in an email, or by emailing us. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Notice, please contact us using the information provided in the "<a href="#contact">How to Contact Us</a>" section below.</p>

<h4 id="privacy">Privacy for Procore Platform Users</h4>
<p>Procore collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.</p>
<p>Procore has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes on behalf of its Clients. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Procore's Client (the data controller). If requested to remove data by our Client we will respond in line with appropriate data protection laws.</p>
<p>We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. Procore will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h4>Rights of EEA Users</h4>
<p>If you are a visitor from the EEA, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you wish to <strong>access</strong> your Personal Information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided in the "<a href="#contact">How to Contact Us</a>" section below. If you wish to <strong>correct, update or request deletion</strong> of your personal information, you can always do so by changing the relevant settings in your Procore account or emailing us.</li>
  <li>In addition, if you are a resident of the EEA, you can <strong>object to processing</strong> of your Personal Information, ask us to <strong>restrict processing</strong> of your personal information or <strong>request portability</strong> of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided in the "<a href="#contact">How to Contact Us</a>" section below.</li>
  <li>You have the right to <strong>opt-out of marketing communications</strong> we send you at any time.  You can exercise this right by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing emails we send you.  To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the contact details provided in the "<a href="#contact">How to Contact Us</a>" section below.</li>
  <li>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
  <li>You have the <strong>right to complain to a data protection authority</strong> about our collection and use of your personal information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA, Switzerland and certain other countries (including the US) are available <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights promptly and at the latest within a month.</p>
<p>However, see above section for situations when Personal Information has been collected by a Client of Procore's that has contracted with us for use of the Services.  You should contact them directly to exercise your data protection rights, and refer to their separate privacy notices.</p>

<h4>Third Parties/Links</h4>
<p>Our Sites and Services may contain links or integrate with other websites and online services, or allow others to send you such links. Procore is not responsible or liable for any damage or loss related to your use of any third-party website or online service. You should always read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of a third-party website or online service before using it, whether directly or in connection with your use of the Sites or Services. Third parties may collect, but we do not authorize them to collect, personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Sites or Services.</p>

<h3 id="changes">PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</h3>
<p>From time to time, we may change this Privacy Notice. When we do, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make; for example we may give you or our Client notice by posting the revised Privacy Notice on the Sites prior to the change becoming effective.</p>
<p>Those changes will go into effect on the effective date shown in the revised Privacy Notice. You can see when this Privacy Notice was last updated by checking the "Effective date" displayed at the top of this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p><strong>Please print a copy of this privacy policy for your records.</strong></p>
