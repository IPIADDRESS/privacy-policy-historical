                    &nbsp;<br>
                    <span class="style11">This privacy policy describes the privacy and data handling practices of ProductTestPanel.com, a website of the Consumer Research Corporation (CRC).<br>                    
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    Please note, to become a ProductTestPanel.com member and participate in its membership incentive promotion, you must be at least 18 years old and a legal resident of the United States with a valid email and mailing address. If you do not meet these requirements, we ask that you do not complete the registration process.<br>                    
                    &nbsp;</span><br>
&nbsp;<span class="style4"><br>
What Information We Collect/How We Use It</span><span class="style2"><br>
</span><span class="style11">We store and use the information you give us in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Our registration form requests that you provide certain contact and profile information (like your name, e-mail address, postal address, and phone number). Some of the requested information is required in order to receive CRC Services including products to test; other information is optional. The required information is indicated as such on the registration pages of the ProductTestPanel.com Web Site. Depending on the specific CRC Services for which a user registers, certain category specific information will be requested. We use this additional data to personalize the delivery of CRC services to you. By obtaining and using this information, we can provide you with the most timely, relevant and individualized service according to your preferences and interests.</span><span class="style2"><br>
&nbsp;<br>
</span><span class="style11">Other than the information we require in order to provide one or more CRC Services to you, you do not have to provide any further information. But your election to withhold certain information may limit our ability to deliver a full array of services to you.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Additionally, we may receive information about you from outside sources and add it to your CRC membership information. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We also collect information such as the identification of the server your computer is logged onto and whether you responded to e-mail messages delivered to you on our behalf. We also may compare our member list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members. You can add and modify any of the information you have provided by following the instructions set forth below.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We use all of this information in the following ways:<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; to provide you with personalized marketing information via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; to send you targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; to send you general and administrative information about your CRC membership via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; and<br>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; to provide your contact information to CRC marketing partners to allow them to send you special offers via electronic delivery and direct mail.&nbsp;&nbsp; This most often occurs when you request that we do so such as when completing an online survey;<br>
6.&nbsp; to deliver products to you for the purpose of review and testing.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis. These agents have access to member personal information as needed to perform their functions for CRC but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Right to Sell/License Data:&nbsp; CRC may sell and/or license the personal information that you provide to us to third party businesses. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation,&nbsp;email marketing, and telemarketing.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Cookies. We may use cookies to, among other things, save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit any CRC Web Site. Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting any CRC Web Site may result in certain parts of the Web Site not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed. For example, if you are a CRC member, you may need to enter your username and password each time you visit memberâ€™s only areas of any CRC Web Site.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Third-Party Action Tags.&nbsp; We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf.&nbsp; These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifts or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness.&nbsp; Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.&nbsp; If you would like more information about this practice and your choices,</span> <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" class="style11">click here</a>.<br>
&nbsp;<br><span class="style11">
E-mail Links. In some instances we may include certain links in our e-mails that will allow us to monitor whether you access specific content or advertisements contained in that e-mail. When you click on one of these links, we will record that click and certain activities on the Web page associated with that link. We may use this information for various purposes, such as to conduct internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior in and to our e-mail advertisements and content, and to better understand and serve you.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Disclosures. CRC may disclose information about you and your use of any CRC Web Site and the CRC Services if CRC believes such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with the law or legal process; (ii) to protect or defend the rights or property of CRC or others; (iii) to enforce the CRC Terms and Conditions or this Privacy Policy; and (iv) to respond to claims that the content(s) of a communication violates the rights of another. In addition CRC may share or transfer information about you and that you provide to CRC, to one or more third party entities pursuant to a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion, or all of, the assets or stock of CRC or its affiliated entities, or as otherwise provided herein. CRC may also disclose information to allow third party business partners and affiliates deliver marketing offers to you.</span></td>
