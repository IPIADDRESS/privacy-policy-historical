							<h3>YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE, AND CONTINUED USE OF THE WEBSITE FOLLOWING ANY CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, SIGNIFIES YOUR CONSENT TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY BOTH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THOSE SET FORTH IN OUR TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE OR PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO US.</h3>
				
							<p>In order to use the Website to and surveys and earn rewards, you will need to create an account. To set up an account, we will collect several personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). We may also collect certain indirect and/or aggregate information as a result of your use of, and interaction with, the Website ("Usage Information").</p>
				
							<ol>
								<li><strong>What Personal Information is collected from me?</strong><br>
								We collect information in several ways from different parts of our website. Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, we require a unique email address and private password. We may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests so we may target the surveys you receive and contact preferences. Wherever ProductReportCard.com collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. You may choose not to provide your Personal Information; however creating an account is a prerequisite for using the full functions of the Website. If, outside of the Website, you provide any Personal Information to a third party company on whose behalf you are completing a survey, for example, in order to receive delivery of a product to be tested, then the use of your Personal Information will be governed by the privacy policy and practices of such third party company. You should always review the website and privacy policies of any party to whom you intend to provide your Personal Information. WE WILL NOT AND CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO ANY OTHER PARTY BY A MEANS OUTSIDE OF THE SITE.</li>
				
								<li><strong>What Usage Information is collected from me?</strong><br>
								<p>We may also collect certain indirect and/or aggregate information as a result of your use of, and interaction with, the Website. We may use certain standard web measurement and tracking technologies such as "cookies," web server logs, or other statistics programs to collect Usage Information and track and record how you use the Website. This data is anonymous and does not personally identify you. We use cookies to (a) remind us of who you are in order to deliver you better service; (b) estimate our audience size by determining repeat usage of the Web site to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior; (c) track your progress in surveys; and (d) measure certain traffic patterns for use as a research tool to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. By not accepting cookies, some Web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information. We also collect IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to track your session while maintaining your anonymity. We analyze this data for certain trends in statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. In those limited cases where session information is not anonymous, ProductReportCard.com will provide notice of the practice and an opportunity to "opt out". Research companies that you may take surveys with through ProductReportCard.com may also use their own cookies. The content of such cookies and the use of the information they contain is controlled by the individual research companies, not by ProductReportCard.com. In connection with our online ad exposure program, you can participate in surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that we are testing for our clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, our clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies, and/or any other related technology (each a “Third Party Technology” and collectively the “Third Party Technologies”). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set, or read in various locations, including, without limitation, our servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and our client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, our client will send your UID and the specific survey, and we will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey.</p>
