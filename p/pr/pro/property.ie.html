<p>
    Daft collects personal data to operate our business and to provide you with the product and services that we offer.  You provide some of this data to us directly, for example when you open an account with us, contact an advertiser on the site, or send a query to our support team.  Other data is collected when you interact with our products, by using cookies and other technologies.
</p>
<p>
    When using our site, you have choices about what data we collect, and when you are asked to provide personal data you may decline.  If you decline to provide data that is necessary to provide you with a particular product or feature, you may not be able to use this product or feature.

</ul>

<h2 id="rights">Your Rights and Choices</h2>

</p>

<ul class="legal-margin-left legal-ul">
    <li><i>Data Retention</i></li>
    <p>
        The amount of time that we retain data for, depends on the type of data being retained, and how that is used.  In some cases, there will be a legal requirement for us to hold data for a specified amount of time.  In other cases, we will not retain the data for any longer than necessary for the purpose that it was collected and processed.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you register an account with us, we will retain the information that you provide to us for as long as you hold this account.  Once an account has been closed, we will continue to retain this data for a period of seven years. This timeframe is in line with the Irish statutory limitation periods.  If you don't actively close your account with us, it automatically become inactive after 3 months of you not accessing it. After this, the data you have provided us will be retained for seven years.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have provided data to us without registering an account, this data will be retained for 7 years after your last date of activity with us.
    </p>

    </p>

    <li><i>Right to Data Deletion</i></li>
    <p>
        Non- registered and registered users of our sites can request we delete any personally identifiable information we hold by using our data request feature.

    </p>

    <li><i>Right to Data Portability</i></li>
    <p>
        Registered users of our site have the right to data portability.
