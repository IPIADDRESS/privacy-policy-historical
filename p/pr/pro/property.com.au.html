The Internet Privacy Policy relates to the collection and use of personal information you may supply to us through your conduct on the web site.<br>
<br>
We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify or remove portions of this Internet Privacy Policy at any time. This Internet Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms and conditions applicable to our www.property.com.au web site or our other web sites. We do not make any representations about third party web sites that may be linked to the web site. This Internet Privacy Policy is also separate from the Privacy Policy of realestate.com.au Ltd, which is available upon reasonable request to our Privacy Officer
<br>
<br>
We recognise the importance of protecting the privacy of information collected about visitors to our sites, in particular information that is capable of identifying an individual ("personal information"). This Internet Privacy Policy governs the manner in which your personal information, obtained through the web site, will be dealt with. This Internet Privacy Policy should be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any changes. We welcome your comments and feedback.<br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
<br>
Personal information about visitors to our sites is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide you with further services or to answer or forward any requests or enquiries. It is our intention that this policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of Information</strong><br>
<br>
Personal information that visitors submit to our sites is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted or for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose, unless we disclose other uses in this Internet Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Copies of correspondence sent from the web site, that may contain personal information, are stored as archives for record-keeping and back-up purposes only. You should be aware that providing information to a real estate agent through our site will result in the information being passed to the real estate agent and your information will then be held subject to the privacy obligations of the real estate agent which may not conform with this Internet Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Disclosure</strong><br>
<br>
Apart from where you have consented or disclosure is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was submitted, personal information may be disclosed in special situations where we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or property, users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Also, we may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure.<br>
<br>
We may engage third parties to provide you with goods or services on our behalf. In that circumstance, we may disclose your personal information to those third parties in order to meet your request for goods or services.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Security</strong><br>
<br>
We strive to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal information submitted to our sites, and we review and update our security measures in light of current technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure.<br>
<br>
However, we will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information you may transmit to us or from our online products and services. Once we do receive your transmission, we will also make our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems.<br>
<br>
In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us. However, we will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
<br>
Cookies are data that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are industry standard and are used by most Web sites, including those operated by us, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. They allow us to customise the web site to your needs. If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature. But you should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide you with some features of our on-line services.<br>
<br>
Like many web site operators, we also use the independent company Nielsen//NetRatings to measure and analyse the internet usage across our web sites. Nielsen//NetRatings is a leader in the internet industry in interactive measurement technologies and market research. We use Nielsen//NetRatings' services to collect the following core information on the usage of our web sites, including:
<ul>
<li>The number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on our web sites;</li>
<li>The number of unique browsers to our web sites;</li>
<li>How long these unique browsers (on average) spend on our web sites when they do visit; and</li>
<li>Common entry and exit points into our web sites.</li>
</ul>
This aggregate, non-personal information is collated by Nielsen//NetRatings and provided to us to assist in analysing the usage of our web sites. The Nielsen//NetRatings data is also accessible by media organizations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other Internet portals.<br>
<br>
All pages on our web sites are coded with software provided by Nielsen//NetRatings. This is transparent to the user as the software makes use of an invisible image (via Javascript) or an invisible Java Applet*, at the bottom of the web page. This software stores a "cookie" in the browser, which contains a unique identifier. This enables Nielsen//NetRatings to track the number of unique browsers to our web sites. This information is collected and aggregated by Nielsen//NetRatings, and in no way does this unique identifier identify a user personally. We do not and will not marry any data collected by Nielsen//NetRatings with any personal information collected on our web sites.<br>
<br>
Nielsen//NetRatings software code cannot be disabled entirely on our web sites, as Nielsen//NetRatings Red Measure code takes into account all web-browser configurations, including the disabling of Java and Javascript. Nielsen//NetRatings' methods of measuring unique visitors takes into account the proportion of visitors who have disabled cookies in their browser.

<em>
* The use of Javascript and/or Java Applet is dictated by the browser you use. Typically Internet Explorer users with Version 4 or above will use the Javascript method. Netscape users, or users whose browser does not support Javascript 1.1, will use the Java Applet method.</em><br>
<br>
