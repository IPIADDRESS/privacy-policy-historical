              is a lot of confusion about cookies, how they are used, and what 
              they can do. Cookies only contain information that the server computer 
              "knew" in the first place, and can only be read by the serving domain 
              that placed them. For instance, if XYZ.com (a fictitious company) 
              utilizes cookies, Webstakes.com's servers can't read their contents 
              nor can XYZ.com's servers read ours. Cookies are an essential part 
              of how the Internet works today, and allow server computers to recognize 
              your computer's browser when you return. If you have ever visited 
              a Web page that automatically provides personalized content without 
              you having to "sign in," such as your own stock portfolio, this 
              is almost certainly being accomplished with a cookie. Since cookies 
              are only text files, they cannot "run" on your computer and have 
              no ability to search your computer for other information, or transmit 
              it to anyone.</font></p>

              <font size="1">Our services have been designed to enable Webstakes.com 
              to provide personalized content to those members who wish to receive 
              it. The majority of the services that are provided for free at Webstakes.com 
              are the result of advertising revenues. Our ability to provide enhanced 
              services and content to our members is dependent on our ability 
              to provide venues for our advertising partners that reach specific 
              demographic segments of our member base. Generally, advertisers 
              have little interest in reaching a specific member - and as a matter 
              of policy we provide no mechanism for an advertiser to reach you 
              or any other specific member unless you request that contact. Instead, 
              our advertising partners have the need to reach members who share 
              common demographic characteristics such as a specific gender or 
              age range. For instance, certain products are more often purchased 
              by men than by women; and, therefore, when advertising those products, 
              in this example the advertiser would prefer to target their messages 
              just to men. The better job Webstakes.com does in providing a mechanism 
              for advertisers to reach specific sub-segments of our members, the 
              more revenue we can generate from advertising and that ultimately 
              is what allows you to get to the wealth of free content that is 
              available at Webstakes.com. </font></font></p>

                a summary report might be "12,000 people clicked on Advertisement 
                'X' today, and of those people, 35% had previously indicated they 
                had an interest in sports." Our advertisers, who make it possible 
                for you to use Webstakes.com for free, need this information to 
                determine how effective their advertising investments are. We
