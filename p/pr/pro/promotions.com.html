              <font size="1">Our services have been designed to enable Promotions.com 
              to provide personalized content to those members who wish to receive 
              it. The majority of the services that are provided for free at Promotions.com 
              are the result of advertising revenues. Our ability to provide enhanced 
              services and content to our members is dependent on our ability 
              to provide venues for our advertising partners that reach specific 
              demographic segments of our member base. Generally, advertisers 
              have little interest in reaching a specific member - and as a matter 
              of policy we provide no mechanism for an advertiser to reach you 
              or any other specific member unless you request that contact. Instead, 
              our advertising partners have the need to reach members who share 
              common demographic characteristics such as a specific gender or 
              age range. For instance, certain products are more often purchased 
              by men than by women; and, therefore, when advertising those products, 
              in this example the advertiser would prefer to target their messages 
              just to men. The better job Promotions.com does in providing a mechanism 
              for advertisers to reach specific sub-segments of our members, the 
              more revenue we can generate from advertising and that ultimately 
              is what allows you to get to the wealth of free content that is 
              available at Promotions.com. </font></font></p>
