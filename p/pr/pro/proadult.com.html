			<b>1. What information do we collect? How do we use it?</b><br>
When you register, we need to know your name, e-mail address, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, mailing address, phone number and payment information. This allows us to safely process and fulfill your purchase process, as well as to notify you of your delivery status. We log the IP address for address verification purposes. However, the "IP" address is never used for any other purpose than to process your purchase. <br>

			<b>3. What about "cookies"? </b><br>
