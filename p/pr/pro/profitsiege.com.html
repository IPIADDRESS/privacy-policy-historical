  <h2 class="style21">Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Java  Script</h2>
  <p class="style21"><a name="4" id="4"></a><strong><em><u>Cookies:</u></em></strong> “Cookies” are a feature in your browser software. If  enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your  computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us  in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you  may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can  enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use  cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate  and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver  specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save  your password for ease of access to our Site.&nbsp;  You can disable cookies, although the Site may not function properly for  you. Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies,  or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about cookies  at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and  functionality of Profit Siege’s websites, you need to accept cookies. </p>
  <p class="style21">    We predominately use “session” cookies,  which are not permanently stored on your hard drive. Session cookies expire  after two hours of inactivity or when you close your browser. When you carry  out the purchase of a service or product on our website, a large amount of data  is processed by our system and transferred through each page of the search or registration.  This information includes all information you input on a registration page or &nbsp;questionnaire you complete as part of the registration  process as well as demographic information that is not unique to you. “Session”  cookies allow us to keep track of this data until you have completed your  search or registration. </p>
  <p class="style21">    We may use “persistent” cookies  primarily to ensure that we do not show you pages that you have already seen  and to personalize your site experience and save you time. “Persistent” Cookies  enable us to recognize whether you have responded to any questionnaire or  registration or have already been presented with an advertisement or  information placed on the site so that we do not show you the same information  again the next time you visit our site. The “persistent” cookies we use will  remain on your computer after you have left our site and will expire when you  log out of the Site or 60 days after your last visit for security cookies, 90  days after your last visit for payment tracking cookies, or two years after  your last visit for advertisement cookies.</p>
  <p class="style21">    We may also allow other companies to  display advertisements to you while you are visiting our Sites. Because your  web browser must request these advertisements from the other companies’  servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if  you had requested a web page from their site. We have no control over the  practices of those third party advertisers and are not responsible for their  technology or tracking. &nbsp;We encourage you  to review the policies of such advertisers when you link to their website.</p>
  <p class="style21"><em><u>Removing Cookies:</u></em>You have the ability to accept, decline  or move cookies at any time by modifying your browser settings. Please see http://cookiecentral.com.  If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and  negatively impact your experience on the web site.</p>
  <p class="style21"><a name="5" id="5"></a><strong><em><u>Web Beacons</u></em><u>: </u></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also use  electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs,  clear gifs or action tags) that allow us to collect certain information about your  visit to these Web pages (including the number of users who have visited those  pages), measure and improve the effectiveness of advertisements, and deliver  services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable  information; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about  web site usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including  a cookie number, time and date of page view and a description of the page on  which the Web beacon resides. This information may be shared with one or more  third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Web  pages, how those visitors use those Web Pages, and the effectiveness of their  advertisements. WE may also use web beacons in email messages sent to  individuals listed in our database.</p>
  <p class="style21"><em><u>Disabling Web Beacons.</u></em>Because Web beacons are the same as any  other content request, you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, they can be  rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie  setup in your browser.</p>
  <p class="style21"><strong><em><u>JavaScript:</u></em></strong> We may also use JavaScript within certain advertisements.  JavaScript is a computer language that enhances the functionality of websites,  particularly in respect to pictures.

  <p class="style21"><em><u>Disabling JavaScript:</u></em>You may deactivate JavaScript via your  browser settings or activate it the same way. If you disable JavaScript you  will not be able to use some of the functions of the website.</p>
  <p class="style21"><em><u>IP  Addresses. </u></em>&nbsp;We  automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the site.  We may use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics,  interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our  community. This information may include the URL that you just came from  (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether  this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP  address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet  "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider  ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable  modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular  computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting  information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not  identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be  used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can,  however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you  are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may  collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.</p>
  <p class="style21"><em><u>Computer  Profiles. </u></em>&nbsp;Profit  Siege may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us  understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, Profit  Siege may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type  of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color  capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search  engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal  Identification Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify  you. </p>

  <p class="style25">Security </p>
  <p><span class="style25"><a name="7" id="7"></a></span><span class="style21">We endeavor to safeguard and  protect your information. When you submit information at the website, such  information is protected both online and offline. The servers in which we store  Personal Information are kept in a secure physical environment. We have security  measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of  personal information under our control. Currently, We use Secure Socket Layer  Software ("SSL") to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL  encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses as  they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although We  take commercially reasonable technological precautions to protect your data, no  data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Therefore, We cannot and do not warrant that your information will be  absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through this site is at your  own risk. However, access to your information is strictly limited, and not  accessible to the public.</span></p>
  <h2 class="style21">Changes to Privacy Statement</h2>
  <p class="style21">We reserve the right to make material  changes to the substance of this Privacy Statement.&nbsp; We will post those changes through a  prominent notice on the web site so that you will always know what information  we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it.</p>
  <h2 class="style21">Your California Rights</h2>
  <p class="style21">A California  resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she  has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household  purposes (“California  customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has  disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’  direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a  disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California  customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to  whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well  as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.</p>
  <p class="style21">    However, under the law, a business is  not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and  discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing  customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing  purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as  long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business  may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to  prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to  exercise that right.</p>
  <p class="style21">    As stated in this policy, you have  agreed to allow us to share information with third parties for their direct  marketing purposes until you remove your information and thus, agreement for  such disclosure. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in  direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide  personally identifiable information on one of our sites or contact us via email  to remove your information from our database. Please note that whenever you opt  in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will  be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do  not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the  third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use  information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that  collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your  information.</p>
  <p class="style21">    California customers may request  further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing info@profitsiege.com.  Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer  each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other  than through this e-mail address.</p>
