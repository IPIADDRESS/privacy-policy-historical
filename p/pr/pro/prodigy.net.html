Personally   identifiable information is any information in Prodigy's possession that is   associated with a specific Member (such as a name or address) and information we   collect about how individual Members use Prodigy Internet (such as the fact that   a Member visits sports pages, or has purchased merchandise through Prodigy   Internet.) It does not include aggregate information, which is general   demographic information (such as the total number of Members who are more than   35 years old), or information which a Member has made public on Prodigy   Internet.

                                                <p>From time to time, we'll make our membership list available to carefully   selected outside organizations. Prodigy may also send approved commercial   communications to Members on behalf of outside parties. If you do not want your   name, address, e-mail address or other personal information to be provided for   such purposes, indicate your intent by going to <a href="https://stage-uverse.stage.att.com/wps/myportal/ProfileManagement" target="_blank">Member   Preferences</a> and choosing to opt out. Prodigy respects the privacy of   personal files in Members' computers. Prodigy does not access, read, upload or   store data contained in or derived from private files without the Member's   authorization. Once a Member gives us that authorization, Prodigy may from time   to time record information about your computer, communications equipment,   browser type and version number, mail application, and operating system software   (but no other non-Prodigy software). Prodigy will use this information on an   individually-identifiable basis only to:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                  <li>analyze how current or future Prodigy Internet features may operate on your   equipment;   
                                                  </li><li>monitor or improve the performance of Prodigy Internet software on your   equipment; or

                                                </ul>
                                                Your authorization also allows Prodigy   to provide you with consistently fast and reliable network access by sending   diagnostic data about your computer and your connections with Prodigy Internet.   Such data includes call failure data, communications bit rate, local access   number used, version numbers, and modem type. Prodigy will use this information   to evaluate and improve the quality of your connections.<br>
                                                Prodigy uses strict   procedures and safeguards designed to protect the privacy of all personal   information. All Prodigy employees with access to personal information are   required to follow specific practices concerning its proper handling. Prodigy's   employees never inspect or disclose to others the contents of these private   messages except with the specific consent of the sender or recipient, or as   specifically authorized or required by law.<br>
                                                Prodigy complies in all respects   with the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, as amended, ("ECPA").

The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them almost   everywhere on the Internet. There are three cookies used throughout Prodigy   Internet pages. The first cookie allows Prodigy to know whom the Member is and   that he or she properly authenticated into our network.

The second cookie is used to   display specific service related messages, such as highlighting upcoming changes   to the service or alerting users to new features and functionality. The third   cookie is an "advertising" cookie that Prodigy uses to keep track of the ads   that the Member has seen. Prodigy tracks which ads have been viewed, and we tie   it to Members' demographic data, but not to personally identifiable information.

                                              Prodigy asks that visitors, providing us personally identifiable   information, be 18 years of age or older. Prodigy believes that parents should   supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control   tools available from Prodigy, online services and software manufacturers that   help provide a kid-friendly online environment. Please instruct your children   not to give us their name, address or e-mail address, sign up to receive our   software, or provide any other personal information to anyone without your   permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please   consult the Privacy Action section of the Direct Marketing Association's website   (<a href="http://www.the-dma.org">www.the-dma.org</a>).

                                                Members of Prodigy Internet are required to be 18 years of age or   older. In fact, you confirmed that you were 18 or older when you enrolled in   Prodigy Internet. However, Members may want to allow their children to use   Prodigy Internet to access the Internet. Although the Internet offers a wealth   of information and exciting opportunities to explore, some of its content may   not be suitable for children. Understandably, as the popularity of the Internet   has grown, so have concerns among parents. Prodigy believes that parents should   supervise their children's online activities and Prodigy suggests that they   consider using parental control tools available from Prodigy, such as Cyber   Patrol, and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online   environment.<br>
                                                <strong>Please instruct your children not to give us their name,   address or e-mail address, or provide any personal information to anyone without   your permission.</strong> It may also be wise to carefully note all the people with   whom your child frequently corresponds over the Internet or on any online   service.   
                                              </p><div align="right">+&nbsp;<strong><a href="#top">TOP</a></strong></div>

                                                Chat, newsgroups, and bulletin boards offer children and parents   alike the unique opportunity to make friends and talk to people all over the   world. Please remember, though, that these interactive features are just like   other public places where strangers meet. If you allow your children to access   interactive features, please remind them of the dangers involved when   corresponding or communicating with strangers or new acquaintances on the   Internet (especially in Chat and Newsgroups, as well as when using   e-mail).<br>
                                                We strongly recommend that you supervise your children's activities   on these areas as you would in any public area. You should help your children   understand that people they do not know will be reading their notes. They should   be careful when choosing what to post (particularly information about   themselves), as well as when choosing the people with whom they correspond.   Also, only you, as a parent, can establish which topics and individual notes are   appropriate for your family, just as you would for television programs or   movies.<br>
                                                Children and teenagers get a lot of benefit from being online, but   they can also be targets of crime and exploitation in this as in any other   environment. Trusting, curious, and anxious to explore this new world and the   relationships it brings, children and teenagers need parental supervision and   common sense advice to ensure that their experiences in "cyberspace" are happy,   healthy, and productive.

                                                  Take advantage   of Prodigy's offer of Cyber Patrol, <a href="#cyberpatrol">which we talk about   below</a>. Also, to further restrict your child's access to discussions, forums,   or bulletin boards that contain inappropriate material, some Internet sites and   private bulletin boards have systems in place for parents to block out parts of   the sites that they feel are inappropriate for their children. If you are   concerned, you should contact the site find out how you can add these   restrictions to any accounts that your children can access.<br>
                                                  The Internet and   some private bulletin boards contain areas designed specifically for adults who   wish to post, view, or read sexually explicit material. Most private bulletin   board operators who post such material limit access only to people who attest   that they are adults but, like any other safeguards, be aware that there are   always going to be cases where adults fail to enforce them or children find ways   around them. The best way to ensure that your children are having positive   online experiences is to stay in touch with what they are doing. One way to do   this is to spend time with your children while they're online. Have them show   you what they do and ask them to teach you how to access the sites. While   children and teenagers need a certain amount of privacy, they also need parental   involvement and supervision in their daily lives. The same general parenting   skills that apply to the "real world" also apply while online.<br>
                                                  If you have   cause for concern about your children's online activities, talk to them. Also   seek out the advice and counsel of other computer users in your area and become   familiar with literature on Cyber Patrol and other filtering devices. Open   communication with your children, utilization of such computer resources, and   getting online yourself will help you obtain the full benefits of these devices   and alert you to any potential problem that may occur with their use.

                                                  By taking   responsibility for their children's online computer use, parents can greatly   minimize the potential risks. Make it a family rule to:   
                                                </p><ul>
                                                  <li>Never give out identifying information - home address, school name, or   telephone number - in a public message such as chat or bulletin boards, and be   sure you are dealing with someone that both you and your child know and trust   before giving it out via e-mail. Think carefully before revealing any personal   information such as age, marital status, or financial information. Consider   using a pseudonym or unlisting your child's name from Internet sites in which   they participate.   
                                                  </li><li>Consider keeping the computer in a family room rather than the child's   bedroom. Be sure to make this a family activity. Get to know their "online   friends" just as you get to know all of their other friends.   
                                                  </li><li>Get to know the Internet sites your child uses. If you don't know how to get   to them, get your child to show you. Find out what types of information it   offers and whether there are ways for parents to block out objectionable   material.   
                                                  </li><li>Never allow a child to arrange a face-to-face meeting with another computer   user without parental permission. If a meeting is arranged, make the first one   in a public spot, and be sure to accompany your child.   
                                                  </li><li>Never respond to messages or bulletin board items that are suggestive,   obscene, belligerent, threatening, or make you feel uncomfortable. Encourage   your children to tell you if they encounter such messages. If you or your child   receives a message that is harassing, or of a sexual nature, or threatening,   alert the appropriate law enforcement agency. You may also send an alert to   Prodigy if the message is from another Prodigy Internet Member, or to the online   service from which the message originated.   
                                                  </li><li>Should you become aware of the transmission, use, or viewing of child   pornography while online, immediately report this to the Federal Bureau of   Investigation and to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children by   calling 1-800-843-5678.   
                                                  </li><li>Remember that people online may not be who they seem. Because you can't see   or even hear the person, it is easy for someone to misrepresent him- or herself.   Thus, someone indicating that "she" is a "12-year-old girl" could really be a   40-year-old man.   
                                                  </li><li>Remember that everything you read online may not be true. Any offer that's   "too good to be true" probably is. Be very careful about any offers that involve   your coming to a meeting or having someone visit your house.   
                                                  </li><li>Set reasonable rules and guidelines for computer use by your children.   Discuss these rules and post them near the computer as a reminder. Remember to   monitor their compliance with these rules, especially when it comes to the   amount of time your children spend on the computer. A child or teenager's   excessive use of the interactive features of the Internet, especially late at   night, may be a clue that there is a potential problem. </li>

                                                To respond to the concerns of our Members, Prodigy offers Cyber   Patrol, which is easy-to-use filtering software from Microsystems Software, Inc.   Cyber Patrol allows you to control which features on the Internet and on your   computer are not suitable and are off-limits to your children. These features   can include Chat, Newsgroups, the World Wide Web, FTP and gopher sites, and even   specific programs on your hard drive, such as games or your financial software.   You have the option either to totally restrict access to these features, or set   limitations to the kinds of features your children can see. Cyber Patrol loads   during Windows start-up and runs in the background. It's password-protected so   inquisitive youngsters can't change your settings or disable the   program.<br>
                                                Cyber Patrol continually researches Internet content to develop a   list of areas it considers inappropriate for children. This CyberNot Block List®   is organized by categories such as violence, nudity, sex, etc. To block access,   parents simply select the categories of content they feel are unsuitable for   their children. They can also add sites not already on the CyberNot list, right   down to the directory or page level. So, if one particular area of a site isn't   suitable for children, parents can block access to just that area. Likewise,   they can allow access to a site that is on the CyberNot list. All Cyber Patrol   settings are per machine, rather than per user, but settings can be unlocked   with a password so that adult family members are not restricted. Cyber Patrol   also allows you to restrict your children's Internet access to certain times of   the day, and limit the total number of hours spent on the Net per day or per   week -- a great way to manage your family's budget and preferences for online   activities.<br>
                                                Cyber Patrol is available for download at the <a href="http://help.prodigy.net/help/enhance/">Enhancements &amp; Upgrades</a> site. Download and install instructions are included. In addition to Cyber   Patrol, parents may take advantage of e-mail filters that are available from   Prodigy.

                                              Please keep in mind that some of the bulletin boards, chat areas,   and newsgroups on Prodigy Internet pages are controlled and operated by a third   party, not by Prodigy. Because of this, remember that when you use these   interactive features, that you may not just be speaking with Prodigy Internet   Members, but with anyone on the Internet. Some third party content is not   protected behind a Prodigy Internet firewall, that is, it is not proprietary to   Prodigy Internet, and is therefore open to anyone to participate. The search   engine technology automatically produces search results that reference sites and   information located worldwide throughout the Internet. Because neither Prodigy   nor the third party service provider has control over such sites and   information, there are no guarantees as to such sites and information, including   as to:<br>
                                              <ul>
                                                <li>the accuracy, currency, content, or quality of any such sites and   information, or   
                                                </li><li>whether a search may locate unintended and objectionable content. </li>
                                              </ul>
                                              Because some of the content on the Internet consists of material that   is adult-oriented or otherwise objectionable to some people, the results of your   search may automatically and unintentionally generate links or references to   objectionable material. Prodigy has no control over, and can make no claim that   such surprises will not occur. Computerized search technology does not give you   search results limited to only the hits that you were seeking. There may be   extraneous hits as well.<br>
                                              There may be extraneous hits as well.
