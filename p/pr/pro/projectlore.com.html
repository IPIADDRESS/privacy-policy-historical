				<p><strong>1.	BACKGROUND</strong><br>
<br>
This is the official privacy policy and statement of California privacy rights (”Privacy Policy”) of Project Lore, LLC (“PROJECT LORE”) and related websites (collectively, the “PROJECT LORE WEBSITE”, or “Website”) and is part of and subject to the terms of use for THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE (the “Terms of Use” or “Agreement”), which can also be found at THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.  Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have such meanings as are set forth in the Terms of Use.  By using THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE or any of the updates and by providing information through or at THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.  If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, do not use THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, or provide any information through or at THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy is intended to apply only to the Personal Information collected by PROJECT LORE (“PROJECT LORE” or “us”) as a result of your use of THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE and does not cover any information collected in any other manner, for any other purpose or by any other web site or enterprise.  For purposes herein, when we refer to “Personal Information,” we mean information such as your name, address, telephone number, blog or other personal website URL, date of birth, e-mail address and any other information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you.  Personal Information also includes information about your personal preferences, survey responses and your transactions or relationship with THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, if you have been a user or you have provided this type of information to PROJECT LORE.  Your provision of such Personal Information may enable you to participate in beta tests, contests, promotions, trial offers, chat rooms, on bulletin boards, to receive text messages and/or emails, to subscribe to newsletters or mailing lists, or to purchase products, content and services using THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.<br>
<br>
PROJECT LORE reserves the right, without advance notice to you, to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revisions and/or the revised Privacy Policy on THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.  Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting.  PROJECT LORE encourages you to check this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use often for updates.  PROJECT LORE may also e-mail you about any changes to this Privacy Policy when they have been made.  Keeping the Personal Information you share with us on THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE secure and ensuring your understanding of how PROJECT LORE collects, uses, discloses and maintains your Personal Information is important to PROJECT LORE. PROJECT LORE endeavors to maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information.<br>
<br>
<strong>2.	RESTRICTED ACCESS</strong><br>
<br>
THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE is offered and made available only to users 13 years of age or older and if you are not yet 13 years old, or your use of our THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE is prohibited or restricted in any way by the laws, regulations or other governmental requirements of the jurisdiction in which you live or reside, or if, for any reason and at any time, you do not agree with all of the terms and conditions of our Terms of Use, please discontinue using THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE immediately because by using or attempting to use THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, you are certifying that you are at least 13 years of age and meet all other eligibility requirements for your use of THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.<br>
<br>
In the event that PROJECT LORE or our affiliates unknowingly send an e-mail or other message to a child (a person under the age of 13 years) who has improperly registered with THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, the child or the child’s parent or legal guardian always have the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future e-mails or text messages using the opt-out (e.g., unsubscribe) mechanism contained in the e-mail or message, or to request termination of the child’s registration and status as a registered user with THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.<br>
<br>
<strong>3.	GENERAL PRIVACY INFORMATION</strong><br>
<br>
THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE is designed and targeted to United States (”U.S.”) audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of “United States.”  PROJECT LORE makes no representation that THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations or is governed by other nations.  If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you use THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, you do so at your own risk and initiative and you are responsible for compliance with all of the laws and regulations that apply to you.  Please be aware that any Personal Information you provide to PROJECT LORE or PROJECT LORE obtains as a result of your use of THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, will be transferred to the U.S and subject to U.S. law.  By using THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, participating in any PROJECT LORE WEBSITE activities and/or providing PROJECT LORE with your Personal Information, you consent to the transfer and processing of Personal Information to the U.S. and in other countries that may not have an equivalent level of protection or a level of data protection considered adequate in the European Union or European Economic Area.  Consequently, you hereby waive any claims that may arise under the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
All users of THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and PROJECT LORE will reject and delete any entry that PROJECT LORE  believes in good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
Your continued participation on THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.  PROJECT LORE may, from time to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information collected off-line to online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format.  PROJECT LORE may also combine Personal Information PROJECT LORE collects online with information available from other sources, including information received from our affiliates, marketing companies, or advertisers.  This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect until terminated in accordance with paragraph 11 of the Terms of Use, even if your use of or participation in any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason.<br>
<br>
<strong><br>
4.	CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong><br>
<br>
A California resident who has provided Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purpose is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request by a user, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed.<br>
 <br>
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business maintains and adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless (1) the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure or (2) the customer refrains from exercising an option that prevents the disclosure.  Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.<br>
<br>
As stated in this Privacy Policy, PROJECT LORE does not share Personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you agree to such disclosure — either by opting in to receive information from such a third party, or choosing not to opt-out from receiving such information.  To prevent disclosure of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites, or, if applicable, opt-out from such use.  Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party or refrain from opting out from such sharing, your Personal Information will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy.  If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use Personal Information.  You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.<br>
<br>
If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you may send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:customerservice@projectlore.com">customerservice@projectlore.com</a>, or you may contact us by regular mail at:  PROJECT LORE, Attention: VP, Programming, 525 Broadway, Ste. 240, Santa Monica, CA 90401.<br>
 <br>
All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled “Your California Privacy Rights” on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request.  For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. (Your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via e-mail.  Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping.) PROJECT LORE will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. PROJECT LORE is not responsible for notices that are not labeled or not sent properly or do not have complete information.<br>
<br>
To all users of THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, if you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:customerservice@projectlore.com">customerservice@projectlore.com</a>, or you may contact us by regular mail at:  PROJECT LORE, Attention: VP, Programming, 525 Broadway, Ste. 240, Santa Monica, CA 90401.<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>6.	CONTESTS AND SWEEPSTAKES </strong><br>

  <br>
<strong>9.	SHARING OF AGGREGATE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</strong><br>
<br>
Some of the aggregate data PROJECT LORE collects in connection with THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE may be shared with advertisers and other business partners of PROJECT LORE and/or its affiliates, but PROJECT LORE does not give any Personal Information to them as part of the relationship except as described in this Privacy Policy.

<br>
<strong>10.	USE OF COMMUNITIES</strong><br>
<br>
If you use any of the community features and functions that may be made available on or through THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, please remember that any information disclosed in these venues is automatically made public.

PROJECT LORE will be in no way responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any information that you disclose or receive through these venues, if any, and you should assume that any disclosure you do make in these venues will be available publicly, even without your knowledge or authorization.  Additionally, to the extent that THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE may have certain features that allow you to send information to others, PROJECT LORE may monitor such messages via electronic software or personnel to check for obscenity, defamation or other types of abusive language, as well as for content that may infringe PROJECT LORE’s rights or the rights of others, all of which we may remove at any time.  PROJECT LORE will not otherwise access these messages except in certain cases, including but not limited to times when we receive specific complaints related to a particular message or are compelled to do so by law.  Also for administrative purposes, PROJECT LORE may opt to keep a mail log that will include a record of which users sent messages and to which users or email addresses they were sent. We will use the addressee information you enter only to send the emails you request.<br>
<br>
<strong>11.	COOKIES </strong><br>
<br>
When you visit THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, PROJECT LORE may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.  PROJECT LORE uses ‘cookie’ technology to collect data regarding your visits to THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.  This data is stored in aggregate form and is not used to identify any particular user or individual.  PROJECT LORE uses cookies and similar tracking technologies in a variety of ways.  PROJECT LORE uses both session cookies and persistent cookies.  A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser.  Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.  Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions.

<br>
<strong>12.	LOG FILE INFORMATION</strong><br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>13.	WEB BEACONS</strong><br>
<br>
When you use The PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, we may employ “clear GIFs” (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Users anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner).  In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.<br>
Although PROJECT LORE may track the numbers of visitors to inform PROJECT LORE on how best to improve and update THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE and enhance the experience for all visitors, Personal Information is not extracted in this process.  PROJECT LORE uses tracking information on an aggregated basis to help PROJECT LORE operate THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, enhance and improve PROJECT LORE’s service, improve the look of THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE and display advertising and marketing information.<br>
<br>
<strong>14.	ADVERTISEMENTS/LINKS</strong><br>
<br>
THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE may contain advertisements, references and links to other websites and organizations.  PROJECT LORE may also use third parties to display or serve advertising on THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE and web-based newsletters or other communications which you may choose to receive.  Often these third party advertisers employ cookie and web bug technologies to measure advertising effectiveness.  You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites you encounter on the Internet.  The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not in the control of PROJECT LORE.  Even if PROJECT LORE has a relationship with the third party, PROJECT LORE does not control their sites or their policies and practices regarding your Personal Information.  This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Personal Information that an Advertiser or ad server may collect from you. PROJECT LORE encourages you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard.<br>
<br>
<strong>15.	DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES</strong><br>
<br>
PROJECT LORE does not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal Information to unaffiliated entities or entities that are not our advertisers, except in the limited circumstances listed below.  When PROJECT LORE plans to disclose your Personal Information to advertisers, PROJECT LORE will ask you to opt-in to do so, in which case their use of your information is subject to the advertisers’ own privacy policies.  PROJECT LORE may disclose Personal Information to affiliates for marketing or administrative purposes.<br>
<br>
<strong>16.	OPERATIONAL SERVICE PROVIDERS</strong><br>
<br>
PROJECT LORE retains the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE services, features, functions and operations.  PROJECT LORE will refer to these third parties as “operational service providers” and PROJECT LORE uses operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of Content and the services, features and functions we bring you and we request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.  Additionally, such operational service providers are not permitted to use your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.<br>
<br>
<strong>17.	OTHER NON-AFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES</strong><br>
<br>
PROJECT LORE will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>When PROJECT LORE  is compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process);</li>
<li>If PROJECT LORE believes your actions violate any law, regulation, our Agreement, this Privacy Policy, or any of our other terms and conditions, rules, offerings or any other services, features or functions of THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, its affiliates, or any of its or their service providers, suppliers, advertisers, customers, users, registered users or any other party;</li>
<li>If, in its sole discretion, PROJECT LORE believes such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect PROJECT LORE ’s business and assets, to defend PROJECT LORE’s interests and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations;</li>
<li>Or, in the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving PROJECT LORE.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>18.	SECURITY &amp; PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
<br>
PROJECT LORE maintains reasonable standards of security and confidentiality.  However, for most Internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission.  PROJECT LORE also limits access to THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes.  PROJECT LORE requests that our service providers follow the same policy.<br>
<br>
<strong>19.	REVIEW, UPDATE OR DELETE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
<br>
Generally, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information collected by THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.  You may also correct factual inaccuracies.  However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility cannot be deleted, but can be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information.  Deletion or attempted deletion of certain Personal Information, such as your user name, may not be permitted and/or may result in suspension or termination of any registration you may have made.  To review, update or delete your Personal Information collected by THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, please go to your account page from either the projectlore.com home page or any of the links to edit your preferences or the information associated with your account on THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.<br>
 <br>
If you wish to review Personal Information collected for Promotions such as contests and sweepstakes, you will need to send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:customerservice@projectlore.com">customerservice@projectlore.com</a>, or you may contact us by regular mail at:  PROJECT LORE, Attention: VP, Programming, 525 Broadway, Ste. 240, Santa Monica, CA 90401.  Personal Information collected for certain Promotions, such as contests or sweepstakes entries are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.<br>
 <br>
Parents (including legal guardians) of children that registered on THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE in violation of the Terms of Use who wish to terminate their child’s registration must send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:customerservice@projectlore.com">customerservice@projectlore.com</a> and provide us with their child’s User ID or alternatively, a parent must provide verifiable identification that they are the parent of the ineligible child.  Children under the age of 13 that are unknowingly registered on THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE are in violation of our Terms of Use.  PROJECT LORE will not allow direct access to a user’s registration and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID (Please see above for how to change your preferences or the information associated with your account). If a parent does not have his or her child’s User ID, the parent will be required to send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:customerservice@projectlore.com">customerservice@projectlore.com</a>, or you may contact us by regular mail at:  PROJECT LORE, Attention: VP, Programming, 525 Broadway, Ste. 240, Santa Monica, CA 90401.  Note, you must include the parent’s name, address, telephone and e-mail address, in addition to the child’s name and e-mail address associated with the child’s User ID registered on THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, plus the child’s date of birth.  PROJECT LORE will send a confirming e-mail to the parent via the e-mail address provided to verify that the parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s registration.  The parent must then confirm by sending a reply e-mail to the designated return address.  PROJECT LORE will then terminate the child’s account but will notify the child of the termination request via e-mail and will identify the name, address and e-mail address of the person making the request.<br>
<br>
<strong>20.	RESERVATION OF RIGHTS</strong><br>
<br>
PROJECT LORE reserves the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including, without limitation, a user of any services, features or functions of THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, if PROJECT LORE believes there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access any services, features or functions of THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.  If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information.  In such cases, PROJECT LORE will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.<br>
<br>
