This is the official privacy policy and statement of California privacy rights (”Privacy Policy”) of Project Lore, LLC (“PROJECT LORE”) and related websites (collectively, the “PROJECT LORE WEBSITE”, or “Website”) and is part of and subject to the terms of use for THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE (the “Terms of Use” or “Agreement”), which can also be found at THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.&nbsp; Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have such meanings as are set forth in the Terms of Use.&nbsp; By using THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE or any of the updates and by providing information through or at THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.&nbsp; If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, do not use THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, or provide any information through or at THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.<br>
This Privacy Policy is intended to apply only to the Personal Information collected by PROJECT LORE (“PROJECT LORE” or “us”) as a result of your use of THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE and does not cover any information collected in any other manner, for any other purpose or by any other web site or enterprise.&nbsp; For purposes herein, when we refer to “Personal Information,” we mean information such as your name, address, telephone number, blog or other personal website URL, date of birth, e-mail address and any other information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you.&nbsp; Personal Information also includes information about your personal preferences, survey responses and your transactions or relationship with THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, if you have been a user or you have provided this type of information to PROJECT LORE.&nbsp; Your provision of such Personal Information may enable you to participate in beta tests, contests, promotions, trial offers, chat rooms, on bulletin boards, to receive text messages and/or emails, to subscribe to newsletters or mailing lists, or to purchase products, content and services using THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE.</p>

4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>A California resident who has provided Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purpose is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request by a user, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed.</p>
<p>However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business maintains and adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless (1) the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure or (2) the customer refrains from exercising an option that prevents the disclosure.&nbsp; Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.</p>
<p>As stated in this Privacy Policy, PROJECT LORE does not share Personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you agree to such disclosure — either by opting in to receive information from such a third party, or choosing not to opt-out from receiving such information.&nbsp; To prevent disclosure of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites, or, if applicable, opt-out from such use.&nbsp; Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party or refrain from opting out from such sharing, your Personal Information will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy.&nbsp; If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use Personal Information.&nbsp; You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you may send an e-mail to customerservice@projectlore.com, or you may contact us by regular mail at:&nbsp; PROJECT LORE, Attention: VP, Programming, 525 Broadway, Ste. 240, Santa Monica, CA 90401.</p>
<p>All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled “Your California Privacy Rights” on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request.&nbsp; For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. (Your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via e-mail.&nbsp; Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping.) PROJECT LORE will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. PROJECT LORE is not responsible for notices that are not labeled or not sent properly or do not have complete information.</p>
<p>To all users of THE PROJECT LORE WEBSITE, if you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please send an e-mail to customerservice@projectlore.com, or you may contact us by regular mail at:&nbsp; PROJECT LORE, Attention: VP, Programming, 525 Broadway, Ste. 240, Santa Monica, CA 90401.</p>
