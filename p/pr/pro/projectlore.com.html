A California resident who has provided Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purpose is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request by a user, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 21.25pt; vertical-align: baseline;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business maintains and adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless (1) the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure or (2) the customer refrains from exercising an option that prevents the disclosure.&nbsp; Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.   As stated in this Privacy Policy, DECA does not share Personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you agree to such disclosure -- either by opting in to receive information from such a third party, or choosing not to opt-out from receiving such information.&nbsp; To prevent disclosure of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites, or, if applicable, opt-out from such use.&nbsp; Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party or refrain from opting out from such sharing, your Personal Information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy.&nbsp; If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use Personal Information.&nbsp; You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 21.25pt; vertical-align: baseline;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you may send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:customerservice@deca.tv">customerservice@deca.tv</a>, or you may contact us by regular mail at: DECA, Attention: VP, Programming, 1299 Ocean Ave., Ste. 410, Santa Monica, CA 90401.</span></p>
