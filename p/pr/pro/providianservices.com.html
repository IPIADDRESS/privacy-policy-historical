<p><strong>Your Privacy</strong><br>
At Washington Mutual, respecting the privacy and security of your personal information is important to us. We know, however, that not everyone who takes their privacy seriously is necessarily well-versed in "legal or regulatory-ese." There are plenty of legal terms in Washington Mutual's own privacy policy, which you will find on the following pages. We urge you to read it carefully, and make note of your rights under this policy. We've tried to provide easy-to-understand explanations of the most frequently used legal terms—terms we are required to use to ensure clarity and consistency. We want to make sure that your personal information is protected, and that you understand the policies that protect you. You'll find the same terms used in many companies' privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Browsers</strong><br>
This site uses a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign a "User ID." Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. Your Washington Mutual User ID automatically identifies your computer—but not you—to our servers when you visit any one of Washington Mutual Web sites. Unless you specifically tell us who you are (for example, by completing an application), or if you are just browsing our site, we will never know who you are even though we assign you a cookie. This site contains links to other sites. If you use a link to visit the site of another company, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of that company or its site.</p>
<p><strong>Safeguarding Customer Information</strong><br>
We only grant access to nonpublic personal information about you (such as your name, address, Social Security number and credit history) to company employees and affiliated and nonaffiliated service providers so that they can provide or offer products and services to you, process and service your accounts, and administer our business.</p>
<p>Our Code of Conduct requires that your information remain confidential. Even if you are no longer our customer, we will continue to treat your nonpublic personal information in the same way as if you were still a customer. In addition, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard this personal information. Some state laws may further restrict the sharing of your nonpublic personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Information</strong><br>
We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:</p>
<ul class="list11">
<li>From you, on forms, via the Internet, by telephone or otherwise. Examples of this type of information include your name, address, Social Security number, credit history and other financial information.</li>
<li>From transactions with us, our affiliates or with others. For example, your payment histories, account balances, and other transaction records.</li>
<li>From credit reporting agencies, such as information relating to your creditworthiness, your credit score and credit usage.</li>
<li> From third parties to verify information you have given us.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Uses of Shared Information</strong><br>
We may share all the information that we collect, as described above, for the following purposes:</p>
<ul class="list11">
<li>To provide you with the products and services you requested.</li>
<li>To offer you additional products and services, from us or from others, that may be of interest to you.</li>

<li>To otherwise conduct business.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information Sharing Among Our Family of Affiliated Companies*</strong><br>
Washington Mutual, Inc. is the holding company for a group of companies which includes financial services providers such as depository institutions, insurance agencies, mortgage companies, consumer finance companies and securities broker-dealers.

That information is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "transaction information."</p>
<p>Unless you request otherwise, we also share all of the other information we collect among our affiliated companies. This information—that is, information other than transaction and experience information—is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "other information."</p>
<p>You have the right to ensure that other information is not shared among our affiliates. <span style="text-decoration:underline; ">If you prefer that we not share other information among our affiliates, you may opt out of those disclosures, as follows:</span></p>

We are permitted by law to share all the information we collect, as described above, with (1) companies that perform marketing services on our behalf and (2) with other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing arrangements. For example, we may share information with financial services providers with which we offer products such as credit cards or accelerated loan payment programs.</p>
<p>We may also share all the information we collect, as described above, with other nonaffiliated third parties that assist us with preparing monthly statements and with the processing and printing of checks. These other nonaffiliated third parties also include credit reporting agencies to whom we report information about your transactions with us.</p>
<p>Please be advised that the opt out rights described below will not apply to the sharing of information with these third parties or to the sharing of information with marketing service providers and joint marketers as described above.</p>

Your opt out will not apply, however, to any accounts your joint account holders hold individually or jointly with persons other than you. If your joint account holders wish to opt out as to such other accounts, they will need to submit a separate opt out request.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing of Nonpublic Personal Health Information</strong><br>
If you engage in an insurance transaction with or through us, we may collect nonpublic personal health information about you. We <strong>do not</strong> share nonpublic personal health information with any nonaffiliated third party unless you have authorized the disclosure, the disclosure is made in connection with an insurance transaction that was initiated by you or the disclosure is otherwise permitted by law.</p>

<p><strong>Your Choice to Limit Marketing</strong><br>
You may limit our affiliates from marketing their products or services to you based on information that we share with them, such as your income, your account history with us, and your credit score.</p>

<p><strong>General Security Tips</strong><br>
While anyone can fall prey to fraud and identity theft, many ways exist to minimize your risk. Washington Mutual provides these security tips so you can guard against fraud and identity theft.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>
<ul class="list11">
<li>Never give out personal information online or over the phone unless you have initiated the contact. Washington Mutual will never request that you submit confidential information over non-secure channels such as e-mail or phone calls initiated by us. </li>
<li>Don't include information such as your driver's license or Social Security number on your pre-printed checks.</li>
<li>Memorize all Personal Identification Numbers (PINs), such as your credit card or ATM card PIN and online passwords. Do not keep these numbers in your wallet or purse. </li>
<li>Avoid using easily guessed or learned information for your online password or PIN.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Safeguard Accounts</strong></p>
<ul class="list11">
<li>Store new and cancelled checks in a secure place and shred unnecessary financial documents. Consider signing up for a check safekeeping service.</li>
<li>Avoid writing your account number on envelopes or other items that may be thrown away later.</li>
<li>Register your credit cards, ATM, check and debit cards with a liability protection service.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Protect Your Mail</strong></p>
<ul class="list11">
<li>If you stop receiving bills, statements or other monthly mailings, or if a bill is not received when expected, contact the issuing company immediately. </li>
<li>Promptly collect incoming mail, and use a locking mailbox if possible. </li>
<li>Send outgoing mail from a secured mailbox or a post office; try to avoid leaving outgoing mail in your home mailbox. </li>
<li>Shred all unwanted pre-approved offers for credit cards, convenience checks or loans. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Personal Computer Security</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
One way a thief can get personal information about you is from your home computer. The following tips tell how you can add to the security of personal information on your home computer.</p>

<p><strong>Passwords and User IDs</strong><br>
For each computer or online service you use, you should have a user ID and password. Try to create the most bizarre and original password, and make sure you protect it. Commit your password to memory and don't share it with anyone.</p>

<p>The following easily identifiable items should be avoided when creating passwords:</p>

<ul class="list11">
<li>Your birth date or a family member's birth date</li>
<li>Names of family members or pets</li>
<li>Social Security number</li>
<li>Phone numbers</li>
<li>Dates of important events, such as anniversaries</li>
</ul>

<p>Tips for creating strong passwords:</p>

<ul class="list11">
<li>Use a combination of numbers, letters and punctuation.</li>
<li>Longer passwords are better.</li>
<li>Make sure it's something you can remember without writing it down.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Install and Use Anti-Virus Programs</strong><br>
Viruses can infect a home computer in many ways: through floppy disks, CDs, e-mail, Web sites and downloaded files. Anti-virus programs help protect your computer against most viruses, worms, Trojans and other unwanted invaders that can make your computer "sick." Viruses, worms and the like often perform malicious acts, such as deleting files, accessing personal data or using your computer to attack other computers. If a file is found to be infected with a virus, most anti-virus programs provide you with options of how to respond, such as removing the harmful item or deleting the file. Installing an anti-virus program and keeping it up-to-date is the best defense for your home computer.</p>

<p><strong>Firewalls: What Are They and How Do I Use Them?</strong><br>
Before you connect your computer to the Internet, you should install a firewall. A firewall can be generally described as a security guard for your home computer. The guard is a piece of software or hardware that helps protect your PC against hackers and many computer viruses and worms. With a firewall, you define which connections between your computer and other computers on the Internet are allowed and which are denied. There are firewall programs, both free and available for purchase, that provide the capabilities you need to help make your home computer more secure.</p>

<p><strong>E-mail Scams: Phishing</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is phishing?</strong><br>
All Internet users should be aware of the online scam known as "phishing" (pronounced "fishing"). Phishing involves the use of e-mail messages that appear to come from your bank or another trusted business, but are actually from imposters.</p>

<p>Phishing e-mail typically will ask you to click a link to visit a Web site, where you're asked to enter or confirm personal financial information such as your account numbers, passwords, Social Security number or other data. Although these Web sites may appear legitimate, they are not. Thieves can collect whatever data you enter and use it to access your personal accounts.</p>

<p><strong>How can I spot a phishing scam?</strong><br>
Look for these warning signs:</p>
<ul class="list11">
<li><strong>Language and tone.</strong> The message you receive may urge you to act quickly by suggesting that your account is threatened. It may say that if you fail to update, verify or confirm your personal or account information, access to your accounts will be suspended. The wording may also be sloppy and contain misspellings.</li>

<li><strong>Requests for personal information.</strong> Scam e-mail typically will ask for personal or account information such as:<br>- Account numbers<br>
- Credit and check card numbers<br>
- Social Security numbers<br>
- Online banking user IDs and passwords<br>
- Mother's maiden name<br>
- Date of birth<br>
- Other confidential information</li>
</ul>
<ul class="list11">
<li><strong>E-mailed instructions to download software.</strong> All your online banking should be done through our secure Web site, and we will not send you e-mail instructions to download any banking software to your computer. Do not install software downloads directly from e-mail messages, or from companies or Web sites you do not recognize. When in doubt, contact the company directly or call our customer service number located on your statement.
</li>
<li><strong>Non-secure Web pages.</strong> Clever thieves can build a fake Web site that looks nearly identical to an authentic one. They can even alter the URL (the Web address) that appears in your browser window. Watch out for non-secure Web pages that ask for sensitive information (secure sites will typically display a lock in the status bar at the bottom of your browser window).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How can I decrease my risk of being a phishing victim?</strong><br>
Here are some safety tips:</p>
<ul class="list11">
<li><strong>Be suspicious of demanding messages.</strong> Messages threatening to terminate or suspend your account without your quick response should be treated as suspicious. A legitimate bank or business should not request personal information from you over an unsecured Web site. When in doubt, call the customer service number of the business (available on your account statement) to confirm the status of your account. Do not use telephone numbers found on the suspected Web site.</li>
<li><strong>Be cautious of downloads.</strong> Installing unknown software on your computer can put your personal information at risk and potentially harm your computer's hard drive. Make sure the software comes from a legitimate Web site, not an e-mail message. If you're not sure whether you should download a program, contact a customer service representative for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Always type in the URL of the Web page you need.</strong> Phishing scams rely on embedded links that take you to fake Web sites. It's safer to type your bank's Web address directly into your browser so you know you're visiting the legitimate site.</li>
<li><strong>Protect your password.</strong> Don't write down sensitive personal information such as your password or Social Security number. Change your password frequently.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your computer up-to-date.</strong> Washington Mutual recommends that you install anti-virus and firewall programs to help keep your computer safe.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Report an online scam</strong><br>
If you receive suspicious e-mail that appears to come from Washington Mutual, please notify us immediately by forwarding the e-mail to <a href="mailto:spoof@wamu.com">spoof@wamu.com</a> (do not open any attachments or click any links found in the suspicious e-mail).</p>
<p>You may also want to forward it to the Federal Trade Commission at <a href="mailto:spam@uce.gov">spam@uce.gov</a>, or contact them at <a href="http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft">www.consumer.gov/idtheft</a>**  or (877) IDTHEFT  [(877) 438-4338)].</p>
<p>If you believe you have provided personal or account information in response to a fraudulent e-mail or Web site, please contact us and contact the other financial institutions with which you have accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Learn more about phishing</strong><br>
To learn more about phishing, read the <a href="http://www.occ.treas.gov/Consumer/phishing.htm">phishing brochure</a>**  provided by The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The OCC charters, regulates and supervises all national banks.</p>

Washington Mutual is not responsible for the quality, delivery or timeliness of goods or services of outside Web sites.</p>

<p><strong>Recent phishing scams</strong></p>
<ul class="list11">
<li>Customers have reported receiving an e-mail message urging them to download software programs to assist them in online banking. By clicking on a link in the message, users are taken to a fake page that appears to be part of a Washington Mutual Web site, and they're given the chance to download the free software. Installing software applications from an unknown or fraudulent source can be extremely dangerous and could give scammers access to your personal banking details.</li>
<li>Some customers have recently received e-mail messages stating that "there have been a large number of identity theft attempts targeting Washington Mutual customers." The e-mail requests that customers confirm their identity for personal online banking by clicking a link and logging onto their accounts.</li>
<li>Another recent fraudulent e-mail pretends to be a "Security Center Advisory" that informs customers their account "has been randomly selected for maintenance," and that they need to click a link to verify their identity.</li>
<li>Yet another fraudulent e-mail states that there is a pending charge (often a quite large one) to the customer's account, and in order to decline the transaction, the customer needs to click a button or a link in the e-mail.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these e-mail messages include links that appear to take customers to Washington Mutual's Web site—however, the Web pages they go to are not legitimate. They actually take customers to fake Web pages where the scammers collect personal and account information. If you receive a suspicious e-mail message or are directed to an unfamiliar Web page, call Customer Service at the number on your statement or, if you have a credit card account, on the back of your card, before giving any personal details or downloading software.</p>
<p><strong>E-mail Attachments</strong><br>
E-mail viruses and worms are fairly common. Here are steps you can use to help you decide what to do with every e-mail message attachment you receive. You should only open and read a message that passes all of these tests:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>know</strong> test—is the e-mail from someone you know? </li>
<li>The <strong>received</strong> test—have you received e-mail from this person before? </li>

<p><strong>Purchasing and Installing Programs</strong><br>
Do the following when you select software for your home computer.</p>
<ul class="list11">
<li><strong>Learn</strong> as much as you can about the product and what it does before you purchase it. </li>
<li><strong>Understand</strong> the refund and return policy before you make your purchase. </li>
<li><strong>Buy</strong> from a local store that you already know or a national chain with an established reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keep Your System Up-to-Date</strong><br>
Most software vendors provide free patches to fix problems in their products. You can usually download these patches from the vendor's Web site. When you purchase a program, it's a good idea to find out how the vendor provides customer support.</p>

<p><strong>Backups: How Important?</strong><br>
It is a good practice to back up important files and folders on your computer. To back up files, you can make copies onto media that you can safely store elsewhere, such as CDs or floppy discs.</p>
