        Progressive uses comprehensive measures on our Web site to protect your

        from visitors to progressive.com, we use it to provide service to you 
        and better understand what our customers want so that we can continue 
        to enhance your online experience. Visitors to Progressive's Web site 
        browse anonymously, and are not required to provide any personal information 
        in order to access our Web site. We do receive from your computer <b>Web 
        Site Information</b> to help us evaluate what our consumers want, provide 
        adequate capacity for our visitors, and display information in the best 
        manner. <br>
        <b><br>

        you looked for when you visited our site, so that the next time you visit 
        progressive.com, your experience will be even better. For example, if 
        you visit our site and obtain an insurance quote, but decide to come back 
        later to continue processing that quote, we are able to save your information 
        so you can pick up where you left off. Information that does not identify

        When you quote or buy insurance on progressive.com, we collect your e-mail

        information. At your request, we will also use this address to provide 
        you reminders about our products and services. Even if you request them,

        <b>Cookie:<a name="cookie"></a></b> A small text file of information saved 
        in the browser when you access certain Web pages. Cookies hold information 
        that identifies you to the Web site (and only that Web site) that gave 
        you the cookie.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Digital certificate:<a name="digital_certificate"></a></b> A small 
        file that can be transferred to your computer over the Internet and used 
        for authentication. Once installed, a digital certificate can be automatically 
        detected and used as needed. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Internet protocol (IP) address:<a name="IP"></a></b> The numbers that 
        are translated into a domain name (e.g., progressive.com). The address 
        is a string of four numbers separated by periods (such as 111.22.3.244) 
        used to represent a computer or other device on the Internet. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Operating system:</b><a name="operating_system"></a> The program responsible 
        for overseeing the basic hardware resources of a computer such as disk 
        drives, memory, keyboard, screen, and CPU. UNIX, DOS, Windows, and Macintosh 
        System 7 are examples of operating systems. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Secure server:<a name="secure_server"></a> </b>A computer and software 
        set up to provide privacy, integrity, and authentication in communications 
        such as a connection on the Internet between a Web browser and a Web server. 
        (See SSL).<br>
        <br>
        <b>Security protocol:<a name="security"></a></b> A specification that 
        describes how computers will talk securely to each other on a computer 
        network. <br>
        <b><br>
        Secure Sockets Layer (SSL):</b><a name="SSL"></a> A protocol that delivers 
        server authentication, data encryption, and message integrity. With SSL 
        implemented, Internet communications are transmitted in a secure, encrypted 
        manner. The information you send is safe, so a third party cannot read 
        or access the information while in transit. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Session ID:</b><a name="session_id"></a> The code used to keep track 
        of a person (using a browser) as they interact with a server. Since the 
        server may interact with many people simultaneously, a session ID is needed 
        to keep track of each person individually. <br>

        Site certificate:</b><a name="site_certificate"></a> Same as a digital

        <b>128 bit encryption:<a name="128_bit"></a></b> A way of making data 
        unreadable to everyone except the receiver. An increasingly common way
