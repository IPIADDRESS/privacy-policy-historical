 <p>This section sets out how we obtain or collect information about you from third parties.</p>

 <h4 class="h4">Information received from third parties</h4>

 <p>Generally, we do receive information about you from third parties. The third parties from which we receive information
 about you will generally include
 <strong>Beauhurst&nbsp;</strong>and
 <strong>&nbsp;Morning Star</strong>.</p>

 <p>It is also possible that third parties with whom we have had no prior contact may provide us with information about
 you.

 us (such as your name and email address) in order for us to provide services to you, we will process your information
 in order to take steps at your request to enter into a contract with you and perform a contract with you (as the
 case may be).</p>

 information to us.</p>

 <strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: where a third party has shared information about you with us and you have not consented
 to the sharing of that information, we will have a legitimate interest in processing that information in certain
 circumstances.
 </p>

 <p>For example, we would have a legitimate interest in processing your information to perform our obligations under
 a sub-contract with the third party, where the third party has the main contract with you. Our legitimate interest
 is the performance of our obligations under our sub-contract.</p>

 <p>Similarly, third parties may pass on information about you to us if you have infringed or potentially infringed any
 of our legal rights. In this case, we will have a legitimate interest in processing that information to investigate
 and pursue any such potential infringement.</p>

 <h4 class="h4">Where we receive information about you in error</h4>

 <p>If we receive information about you from a third party in error and/or we do not have a legal basis for processing
 that information, we will delete your information.</p>

 <p>
 <strong>Information obtained by us from third parties</strong>
 </p>

 <p>In certain circumstances (for example, to verify the information we hold about you or obtain missing information
 we require to provide you with a service) we will obtain information about you from certain publicly accessible
 sources, both EU and non-EU, such as Companies House, online customer databases, business directories, media publications,
 social media, and websites (including your own website if you have one).</p>

 <p>In certain circumstances will also obtain information about you from private sources, both EU and non-EU, such as
 <strong>Beauhurst&nbsp;</strong>and
 <strong>&nbsp;Morning Star</strong>.</p>

 <p>

 <strong>&nbsp;</strong>necessary to perform a contract or to take steps at your request to enter into a contract (Article
 6(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation).
 <br>
 <strong>Reason why necessary to perform a contract</strong>: where you have entered into a contract or requested that we
 enter into a contract with you, in certain circumstances, we will obtain information about you from public sources
 in order to enable us to understand your business and provide services to you or services to a sufficient standard.</p>

 <p>For example, we would obtain and/or verify your email address from your website or from a directory where you ask
 us to send you information by email but we do not possess the information or we need to confirm that we have recorded
 your email address correctly.</p>

 <p>
 <strong>Legal basis for processing</strong>:
 <strong>&nbsp;</strong>our legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation).
 <br>
 <strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: in certain circumstances, we will have a legitimate interest in obtaining information
 about you from public and private sources. For example, if you have infringed or we suspect that you have infringed
 any of our legal rights, we will have a legitimate interest in obtaining and processing information about you from
 such sources in order to investigate and pursue any suspected or potential infringement.</p>

 <p>
 <strong>Legal basis for processing</strong>:

 imposed by relevant law or regulation);</li>
