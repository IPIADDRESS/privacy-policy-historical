AdHarmonics, Inc. (herein referred to as "we", "us" or "our") considers your privacy a very important issue.  We design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy as a primary concern.

</p>
<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>
Personally identifiable information ("PII") is information that identifies you, is not generally available to the public and may include information about your family as well as you personally.  We collect the PII that you provide us via the Site so that we may provide you with the service(s) we offer. You are not obligated to provide us with PII; however, if you do not provide us with certain information that we request, we may not be able to respond to your requests, process your applications or otherwise conduct the business contemplated between you and us.
</p>
<p>
For example, in order to provide you with insurance quotes, we collect your personal contact information including name, telephone number, mailing address, email address, gender, birthday and marital status.  For home insurance quotes, we also collect details about your home and personal property.  For auto insurance quotes, we collect information about your vehicles and drivers and may also collect information about your credit and your existing insurance coverage.
</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
A "cookie" is a test file that is placed in the browser files of your computer when you visit a website. The cookie enables us to relate your use of our website to information that you specifically and knowingly provided to us. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and to provide content we believe may be of interest to you. Additionally we track usage statistics to better understand how people interact with our site. Cookies do not collect personally identifiable information; the information collected is in an aggregate, non-identifiable form.  We do, however, store a unique identifier in the cookie that may tie back to a consumer record in our databases that contains PII.
</p>
<p>
When you visit our site, we also capture the user agent string from your device which helps us classify the type of device you are using to interact with the Site (e.g. desktop, tablet, mobile device).  The user agent string does not, however, collect any personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we partner with a third party ad network to provide display advertising on our Site and/or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners use cookies, web beacons, images, and scripts to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. We do not tie the information gathered by our third party advertising partners to personally identifiable information in our databases.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by
<a href="http://preferences.truste.com/">clicking here</a>.
Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
</p>
<h3>Use of Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
By submitting your e-mail address and/or phone number (as the case may be) via this Site, you authorize us to use that e-mail address and phone number to contact you periodically, via e-mail and manually-dialed and/or auto-dialed telephone calls, concerning (i) your quote requests, (ii) any administrative issue regarding the Site or our services and/or (iii) information or offers that we feel may be of interest to you.  We may also send e-mails to you periodically regarding updated quotes. You may opt out of receiving e-mails from us at any time by unsubscribing as set forth in the applicable e-mail.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Additionally, by filling out information on this Site as part of your request for information about insurance policies and quotations, you authorize us to provide that information to various insurance companies, insurance agents and other related third parties that participate in our insurance quote network (collectively "Insurance Providers"). The Insurance Providers may provide your personal information to their insurance carriers, suppliers and other related vendors in order to generate price quotations and information relevant to insurance policies that you have requested, and the Insurance Providers may use the contact information (including telephone number(s)) you have provided to contact you directly with quotations by means of telephone (manually or auto-dialed), fax, email and postal mail, even if you have registered your phone number(s) on local and/or national no-call lists. You further acknowledge and agree that each Insurance Provider that receives your quote request from this website or from our affiliates may confirm your information through the use of a consumer report, which may include among other things, your driving record and/or credit score. For purposes of faxing, it is understood that Insurance Providers have an established business relationship with each user of this website, if required to comply with the then current law.
</p>
<p>
Please be aware that, once you submit a quote request, there is no way for you to access or update the information you have submitted in connection with that request.  If you make a mistake in a request, you should re-submit your request and information in full.
</p>
<p>
We will retain your information for as long as required to provide you services.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
</p>
<p>
We use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Insurance Providers are obligated to protect your PII to at least the degree established in this Policy. Additionally, it is our policy to require Insurance Providers to use commercially reasonable means to secure the receipt and processing of your PII.  You should be aware, however, that after an Insurance Provider contacts you directly, any information you provide directly to the Insurance Provider, which may be the same as or similar to the PII you submitted to us through this Site, will no longer be covered by this Policy.  Before providing your information directly to an individual Insurance Provider, you should make sure that you have read and understand that Insurance Provider's privacy policies and practices.  We have no control over the Insurance Providers and their practices and we are not and will not be responsible or liable, financially or otherwise, for their respective privacy policies and practices. Also, be aware that the Insurance Providers may use the PII they acquire from this Site in connection with other information they acquire about you (from other sources that have collected PII about you such as credit reporting companies, etc.) as well as information you provide them directly. We are not and will not be responsible or liable, financially or otherwise, for any of the PII that you provide directly to any Insurance Provider or that they acquire from sources other than this Site.  In addition, if you no longer want to receive communications from the Insurance Providers regarding insurance quotes, you must contact the respective Insurance Provider(s) directly and request that they no longer contact you.  You may not opt out of communications from any Insurance Provider by contacting us.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We may also share your PII with the following types of entities and/or under the following circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We may share your information with third parties with whom we have promotional or advertising relationships (provided that we are not otherwise restricted from this sharing of information).  If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us at compliance@adharmonics.com.
</li>
<li>
We may provide your PII to, or permit access to it by, our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, vendors and/or service providers, such as our ISP or infrastructure hosting companies, for the purpose of processing such information and/or contacting you on our behalf, or where such access is incidental to their providing assistance to us. In such cases, we expect these parties to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this privacy policy.
</li>
<li>
At some point, we may establish subsidiaries or other related companies, or merge with or be acquired by another company. Should that happen, then we may disclose your information to them, in which case we will request that they abide by this Policy. We may also disclose some information to a potential acquirer, although such disclosure would be subject to normal and customary requirements.
</li>
<li>
We reserve the right to disclose your PII as required by law or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a court order, legal process or judicial proceeding served on us.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Opt-out</h3>
<p>
If you no longer desire to receive communications from us, you may opt-out by emailing our Customer Support at compliance@adharmonics.com or by contacting us by postal mail at provide-insurance.com, 210 Broadway, Suite 302, Cambridge, MA 02139.
</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
The security of your personal information is important to us and we take commercially reasonable precautions in an effort to safeguard it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at compliance@adharmonics.com.
</p>
<h3>Affiliated and Other Third Party Websites and Advertisements</h3>
<p>
This Policy applies only to provide-insurance.com. The Site may contain links to other websites that we believe may be beneficial to our users.  Please be aware, however, that we do not exercise control over the website(s) of any third party that you may click to or view as part of a frame on a page on this Site.  These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personally identifiable information from you.  We are not responsible or liable, financially or otherwise, for the privacy policies or practices of these sites or the actions or policies of any third party.  You should read and understand the applicable privacy policies of those third parties before providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.  You should always be careful in how you share any sensitive personal information with any third party.
</p>
<h3>Changes in this Policy</h3>
<p>
If we change our privacy practices, we will post a revised version of the Policy on this Site and the revised Policy will be effective when posted. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, so please review the Site frequently for any changes.  By continuing to use the services or the Site after the revised Policy is posted, you will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, and you will be subject to, such amended or revised Policy.  If we make any material changes we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. By continuing to use the services or the Site after the revised Policy is posted, you will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, and you will be subject to, such amended or revised Policy.
