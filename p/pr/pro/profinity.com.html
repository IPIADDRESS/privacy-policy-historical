   <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h5>We Are Committed to Safeguarding Customer Information </h5>
  <p>In order to better serve your needs now and in the future, we may ask you to provide us with certain information. In order to provide the products and services you request from us, we may also obtain consumer reports and other information from consumer reporting agencies, our affiliate consumer reporting agency companies, and other data and information providers. We understand that you may be concerned about what we will do with such information - particularly any personal or financial information. We agree that you have a right to know how we will utilize such information. Therefore, we have adopted this Privacy Policy to govern the use and handling of your personal information. </p>
  <h5>Applicability </h5>
  <p>This Privacy Policy governs our use of the information that you provide to us or we otherwise obtain in providing our products and services to you. Our partner company, CSIdentity Corporation, Inc.

  <h5>Types of Information </h5>
  <p>Depending upon which of our services you are utilizing, the types of nonpublic personal information that we may<br>
    collect include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information we receive from you on applications (either applications with us directly or through our clients), forms and in other communications to us, whether in writing, in person, by telephone or any other means </li>
    <li>Information about your transactions with us, our affiliated companies, or others; and </li>
    <li>Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency and other data and information providers. </li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Changes to Information </h5>
