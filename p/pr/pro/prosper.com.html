users.&nbsp; We always let you know which is which.&nbsp;
Additional information may be gathered during your subsequent use
of the site, whenever you choose to provide it.&nbsp; We also
collect information about your loan account balance and payment
history.</p>

<p>Certain personal information must be supplied during the
investor and borrower registration processes, as indicated below,
in order to (a) enable registered users to login to the site, (b)
determine borrowers' eligibility for loans through our proprietary
credit scoring process, (c) verify borrowers' and investors'
identities, (d) establish borrowers' and investors' ability to
invest in and request loans by verifying that they are at least 18
years of age, and (e) guard against potential fraud.&nbsp; This
basic personal information includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name (member registration).</li>

<li>Your email address (member registration).</li>

<li>Your date of birth (borrower/investor registration).</li>

<li>Your home address and telephone number (borrower/investor
registration).</li>

<li>Your Social Security number (borrower/investor
registration).</li>
</ul>

<p>When you register as a borrower, we will use this basic personal
information to pull a credit report from a credit bureau to
determine your creditworthiness as well as to help investors assess
your loan request in the context of your overall financial
situation.&nbsp; We will also use your required and optional
information to facilitate activities and transactions that need to
occur during online person-to-person lending, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generating public borrower profiles on the site.</li>

<li>Assigning you a Prosper Rating based on your credit history and
financial circumstances.</li>

<li>Enabling our financial services partners to implement automatic
payments and fund transfers.</li>

<li>Contacting you if there is a problem completing a transaction
you requested or to discuss a problem with your account.</li>

<li>Implementing collection activities as needed.</li>

<li>Maintaining regular communications with you concerning
transactions you initiate, such as requesting information or
assistance, submitting a loan request, making payments,
transferring funds, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you register as an investor, we will request the basic
personal information and additional optional information in order
to facilitate such activities as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generating a public investor profile on the site.</li>

<li>Enabling our financial services partners to implement fund
transfers and the receipt of borrower payments.</li>

<li>Contacting you if there is a problem completing a transaction
you requested or to discuss a problem with your account.</li>

<li>Maintaining regular communications with you as may be necessary
to execute transactions you request, such as transferring funds or
submitting Quick Invest orders.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, we gather names and email addresses of people who
contact us through our website with questions about our company or
investing/borrowing operations.&nbsp; We collect this information
for the sole purpose of responding to such inquiries.</p>

<p>Finally, we collect information about your computer and your
visits to our website, such as your IP address, geographical
location, browser type, referral source, length of visit, and page
views through the use of log files.&nbsp; We use this aggregated
information in the administration of our website to improve its
usability and to evaluate the success of particular
marketing/advertising campaigns, search engine optimization
strategies and other marketing activities.&nbsp; We use
non-identifying and aggregated information to help optimize our
website based on the needs of our users.&nbsp; No personal or
personally identifiable information about any individual user is
collected.</p>

<p>We retain this information to satisfy legal requirements such as
recordkeeping and tax and credit reporting requirements, as well as
for purposes of fraud prevention, audit and data integrity.</p>

<p>Tell-a-Friend and Other User Referral Activities</p>

<p>Users may choose to refer friends to the site or directly to
their loan listings via email.&nbsp; If this referral occurs
independently of our site or a partner's site, we do not track the
referral other than as a unique page view.&nbsp; Since we do not
collect any information from the referring party or the recipient
of the external email referencing our site, we do not capture or
store any information about either party.&nbsp; If friends refer
each other to our site or to their loan listings via a partner's
site, we will store and track information about the referring and
receiving parties only long enough to determine the effectiveness
of our marketing activities which contributed to the referral.</p>

<p>Users may choose to electronically forward a link or page to a
friend by clicking the "Email" link.&nbsp; Users may also choose to
share something from our blog (<a href="http://blog.prosper.com/">http://blog.prosper.com/</a>) with
a friend through our referral service.&nbsp; The users must provide
their own list of recipients in order for these emails to be
sent.&nbsp; This information is not used for any other purpose and
we do not store the names or email addresses of your friends.&nbsp;
These are one-time only emails initiated by friends of the
recipients, and the recipients are not added to any mailing list or
contacted by Prosper apart from this specific email.</p>

<p>Our users can also refer friends to the site by completing a
simple form to generate an email invitation.&nbsp; In this case,
the email invitations do not track back to any particular loan
request, and the sender will not know whether you are a borrower,
investor or simply a member.&nbsp; This information is stored for
the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the
success of our referral program. In the case where a bonus is
offered to a member in return for the referral, Prosper will only
retain the information about the referred parties to properly
credit the account of the member initiating the referral.&nbsp; The
information is not used for any other purpose.</p>

<p>Communications From Us</p>

<p>When you register on our site you will receive emails that
confirm specific actions you requested.&nbsp; These notifications
are typically sent to notify you of a change in status, or for
legal or security purposes. For example, you will receive
notifications confirming your registration, the successful
verification of email addresses and bank accounts, and the
successful submission of loan requests and investment orders; you
will receive notifications regarding certain changes to legal
agreements and required loan and privacy disclosures; and you will
receive progress updates on the status of loan requests and
investment orders.&nbsp; These are transactional notifications that
you generally cannot opt out of receiving.&nbsp; We may also send
you responses to emails you send us, if appropriate or
applicable.</p>

<p>From time to time, we will also send user surveys, requests for
user feedback regarding user experience and site operations,
newsletters, event notifications, group leader notifications, or
marketing offers from us or from us on behalf of our marketing
partners.&nbsp; The completion of these surveys or requests for
feedback, receipt of these newsletters or notifications, or
acceptance of any offer is strictly voluntary.&nbsp; If you do not
wish to receive these surveys or user feedback emails, newsletters,
notifications or marketing offers, please log in to your account,
go to "My Account" &gt; Settings &gt; Communication Preferences"
and click on the "Edit" button.&nbsp; A link to your Communication
Preferences page will be included in any offer email you receive
from us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How and When Your Information Is Shared With Other Parties</p>

<p>Information is shared with other parties in the following
ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Required and optional information about borrowers and investors
is displayed on public profiles that members can update at any
time; certain information is optional and you can choose not to
supply it and/or can remove the optional information at any
time.</li>

<li>Personal but not personally identifiable information about
borrowers is contained in loan listings that can be viewed by all
users; this information is also filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and as such is made publicly available.</li>

<li>Financial and credit information about borrowers is displayed
to qualified investors on loan listing pages; is filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and as such is made publicly
available; and is contained anonymously in loan data files
available through Prosper's Developer Tools and Marketplace
Performance pages.</li>

<li>Information is shared directly between users and/or potential
users.&nbsp; Information shared directly by users and/or potential
users might contain personally identifiable information.</li>

<li>If we sell a loan originated through our platform to an
investor, we may provide that investor with personally
identifiable, financial and credit information about the
borrower.&nbsp; However, we do not provide this information in
connection with sales of our Borrower Payment Dependent Notes
("Notes").</li>

<li>Information may be shared to meet any applicable law,
regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, for
the purposes of limiting fraud or in connection with the sale of
Prosper to a third party.</li>

<li>Information may be shared with a number of trusted partners
that perform vital functions as part of our operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>For privacy purposes, borrowers and investors remain anonymous
on the site and are identified only by their chosen screen
names.&nbsp; However, borrowers have public profiles and loan
listings on the site that display their information to any users
who view these pages.&nbsp; The loan listing pages include
borrowers' credit grades and other financial information that is
shown to qualified investors so that they can effectively evaluate
loan requests.&nbsp; As noted above, this information is also
contained anonymously in loan data files available through
Prosper's Developer Tools and Marketplace Performance pages.&nbsp;
Loan listings also contain certain personal information.&nbsp;
Investors also have public profiles on the site that display
personal information that they have opted to include.&nbsp;
Finally, members creating blog/forum posts are identified by the
names they choose to provide.&nbsp; To protect borrowers' and
investors' privacy, however, the blog/forum posts do not track back
to loan listings or loan funding decisions, respectively.</p>

<p>Prosper is not responsible for any personal information that
borrowers or investors may choose to reveal about themselves in
their screen names, loan requests, public profiles, or blog/forum
posts.&nbsp; Given the community nature of any person-to-person
transaction site, however, it may be in the best interests of
borrowers and investors to share some level of personal information
in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome (e.g., it may be
necessary for a borrower to share a certain amount of personal
information in order for the borrower's loan to receive full
investor commitments).</p>

<p>If you use our blog on this site, you should be aware that any
personally identifiable information you submit there can be read,
collected, or used by other users of this forum, and could be used
to send you unsolicited messages.&nbsp; We are not responsible for
the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in
this forum.To request removal of your personal information from our
blog or community forum, contact us at privacy@prosper.com.&nbsp;
In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal
information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to
do so and why.</p>

<p>In order for a borrower listing to become a loan, a borrower
must receive aggregate funding commitments from investors that
equal or exceed the minimum funding amount applicable to such
listing. When a borrower submits a listing, it will automatically
be allocated to one of three investor funding channels, based upon
a random allocation methodology determined by Prosper: (i) the
first channel allows investor members to commit to purchase Notes
from Prosper, the payments of which are dependent on the payments
the borrower makes on his or her loan (the "Note Channel"); (ii)
the second channel allows investor members to commit to purchase
100% of a borrower's loan directly from Prosper ("Loan Channel A");
and (iii) the third channel reserves a borrower's loan for sale to
an investor member who has already committed to purchase certain
loans from Prosper ("Loan Channel B"). We provide information
obtained about a borrower during the loan application and approval
process, including personally identifiable, financial and credit
information, to the investor who purchases such borrower's loan
through Loan Channel A or Loan Channel B. &nbsp;We do not provide
this information to investors who purchase Notes through the Note
Channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may share your information with law enforcement or other
government agencies as required by law or for the purposes of
limiting fraud.&nbsp; We reserve the right to disclose your
personally identifiable information when we believe that disclosure
is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial
proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.</p>

<p>Prosper works with a number of trusted partners that perform
vital functions as part of our operations, including platform
administrators, loan servicers, credit bureaus, collection
agencies, electronic payment service providers, quality assurance
agents, and companies that distribute our emails for us or collect
survey information from our customers.&nbsp; In addition, since all
loans originated through Prosper are made to borrowers by WebBank,
if you request a loan, your information will be shared with
WebBank. <a href="http://www.prosper.com/WebBank-privacy-policy.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a copy of WebBank's privacy
policy.&nbsp; Information is shared with these third parties only
to the extent necessary for us to process the transactions you
initiate or to perform other specific services, like
collections.&nbsp; Our partners are legally required to keep your
information private and secure.</p>

<p>How Your Credit History and Loan Status Information Are
Shared</p>

<p>When you create a loan listing, we display your
listing-including your screen name, Prosper Rating, and state of
residence-publicly on the Prosper website. Registered Prosper
investors will also see certain credit data collected from or
calculated based on your credit bureau file in the credit profile
section of your listing.&nbsp; The credit profile section includes
the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Credit score range.</li>

<li>Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.</li>

<li>Stated income.</li>

<li>Employment status, occupation and tenure in current
position.&nbsp;</li>

<li>The number of accounts on which you are currently late on a
payment; this includes any unpaid charge-offs or other derogatory
balances.</li>

<li>The total past-due amount you owe on all delinquent and
charged-off accounts.</li>

<li>The number of 90+ days past-due delinquencies in your credit
file in the last 7 years.</li>

<li>The number of negative public records in your credit file over
the last 12 months, and over the last 10 years; negative public
records include, among other things, bankruptcies, liens, and
judgments.</li>

<li>The month and year your first recorded credit line was opened;
credit lines may include, among other things, revolving,
installment, and mortgage credit.</li>

<li>The total number of credit lines appearing in your credit file,
along with the number that are open and current; credit lines may
include, among other things, revolving, installment, and mortgage
credit.</li>

<li>The total balance on all of your open revolving credit
lines.</li>

<li>Your bankcard utilization ratio, expressed as a percentage,
reflecting the ratio of the total balance used, to the aggregate
credit limit on, all of your open bankcards.</li>

<li>The number of inquiries made by creditors in the last six
months, as shown in your credit file.</li>

<li>Whether you own a home.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is necessary to allow prospective investors to see this
information as they evaluate your loan request.&nbsp; As noted
above, this and other financial and credit information obtained
from a credit bureau is also contained anonymously in loan data
files available through Prosper's Developer Tools and Marketplace
Performance pages.</p>

<p>If you successfully receive a loan through Prosper, we will also
display status information about your loan to your investors.&nbsp;
Your loan tracks back to you by your screen name, so it is
important that you choose a screen name that will protect your
anonymity.&nbsp; You should not choose a screen name that resembles
your actual name or that of any other person.&nbsp; Further, you
should not include your name or personally identifiable information
in your loan request.&nbsp; Your payment performance information
such as late payments, collections activity or any other instances
of delinquency will be displayed to your investors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where You Can Find and/or Correct Your Information</p>

<p>You can access all of your personal and personally identifiable
information that we collect online and maintain by logging in to
your account and going to "My Account &gt; Settings".&nbsp; This
section of the site is password-protected to better safeguard your
information.&nbsp; As a registered user, you can update your
password, email address, secret question, screen name, physical
address, phone numbers, bank account information, and member page
at any time on the website, and if you need to change any other
information in your profile or request that we delete/remove your
information, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@prosper.com">support@prosper.com</a>.&nbsp; To
protect your privacy and security, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@prosper.com">support@prosper.com</a> to make
changes to your sensitive account information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will retain and use your information as needed to provide you
services, to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve
disputes, to enforce our agreements or as otherwise required by
law.</p>

<p>Web-related Information Collection</p>

<p>Cookies are small text files created by a website that store
information on your computer, such as your preferences when
visiting that site. Prosper uses cookies when you sign in, to keep
track of your personal session, including some account identifiers
so that we can ensure that you are the only person making changes
to your account. Cookies are also used to gather statistical data,
such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the ISP's
domain name and country of origin, and the addresses of sites
visited immediately before and after coming to our site, as well as
your "click stream" activity (meaning, the paths taken by visitors
to our site as they navigate from page to page) and transactional
attributes in accordance with information you voluntarily submit in
the course of using our site. These anonymous data are aggregated
for analysis to ensure proper functioning of our site, in terms of
navigation and usability, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness
of our marketing efforts. We also use cookies to track your
activity on our site as a unique person. We use session ID cookies
to make it easier for you to navigate our site. Session ID cookies
expire when you close your browser. We use a persistent cookie that
remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time, so that
we can recognize you when you return to our website. You can remove
persistent cookies by following directions provided in your
Internet browser's "help" file; however, because we use cookies for
our sign-in functionality, if you choose to disable cookies you
will not be able to log on to the Prosper website.&nbsp; All of
this information is stored in an encrypted fashion for security
reasons, and no personal information about you is stored.</p>

<p>We do not process or respond to "do not track" signals or other
similar mechanisms whereby a visitor to a website requests that it
disables collection of information about the visitor's online
activities over time and across different websites.&nbsp;
Additionally, we may permit affiliates and partners to collect such
information.&nbsp; For instance, we might do so to track the source
of traffic to our website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We use third-party tracking services (e.g., Google Analytics)
that use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information
about visitors to our site in the aggregate (such as page views and
referral page information to track the success of our marketing
efforts to bring people to our site as well as overall site
performance).&nbsp; We also employ a software technology called
clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better
understand user interaction with our website. Clear gifs are tiny
graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,
and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In
contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard
drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about
the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie
the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally
identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Links to Other Sites</p>

<p>We may offer links to partners' sites. We make the decision to
provide links to these sites based on the quality of information
provided at the time the links are enabled, and we make every
effort to monitor the continuing quality of content provided on
these sites. However, these external sites are not subject to this
privacy policy. Further, Prosper has no control over the content of
these sites. Please consult the privacy policies on these sites
before you provide them with any of your personal information.</p>

<p>Social Media Features</p>

<p>Our website includes social media features and widgets
("Features"), such as the Facebook Like button. These Features may
collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site,
and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function
properly. Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted
directly on our website. Your interactions with these Features are
governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

<p>Compliance With State and Federal Laws</p>

<p>This privacy policy may not constitute your entire set of
privacy rights, as these may also vary from state to state. To be
certain of your privacy rights, you may wish to contact the
appropriate agency in your state that is charged with overseeing
privacy rights of consumers. Certain regulations issued by state
and/or federal government agencies may require us to maintain and
report demographic information on the collective activities of our
membership. We may also be required to maintain your personal
information for at least seven years in order to be in compliance
with applicable federal and state laws regarding recordkeeping,
reporting and audits.</p>

<p>Prosper's Security Policy</p>

<p>Expert fraud prevention and protection</p>

<p>Prosper takes strong steps to safeguard your personal and
personally identifiable information through vigorous physical,
electronic and operational policies and practices.&nbsp; All data
are considered highly confidential.&nbsp; Data can only be read or
written through defined service access points, the use of which is
password-protected.&nbsp; The physical security of the data is
achieved through a combination of network firewalls (there is no
direct communication allowed between the database server and the
Internet) and servers with hardened operating systems are all
housed in a secure facility.&nbsp; Access to the system, both
physical and electronic, is tightly controlled and limited to only
those employees or third parties who have a need to know.&nbsp; We
do not allow visibility to Social Security number, bank account
information, or credit card information via the website.&nbsp;
Further, we also equip our servers with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
certificate technology to ensure that when you connect to our
website you are actually on our site. SSL also ensures that all
data entered into the website are encrypted. To verify that SSL is
being used, look for the key or padlock icon on your browser. For
further encryption protection, we use a 128-bit secure browser for
logins and transactions.</p>

<p>100% Identity Theft Guarantee</p>

<p>Although Prosper has a stringent process in place to prevent
fraudulent persons from using stolen identities to acquire loans,
there are still limited times when identity theft occurs. Prosper
will work with law enforcement authorities to track down and
prosecute persons who have committed identity theft. If you are an
investor who suspects that you've invested in a loan belonging to a
person who has committed identity theft, please <a href="http://www.prosper.com/help/support.aspx">email customer
support</a>and include the loan number and the reason you suspect
identity theft.</p>

<p>Secure data center</p>

<p>We store all sensitive financial information in a
state-of-the-art, highly secure data center that adheres to SSAE 16
standards. Physical access to the data center is strictly
controlled and we use the latest in threat prevention technologies
including the very best in firewall, VPN, antivirus, Web filtering
and antispam technologies.</p>

<p>Session time-outs</p>

<p>We also employ session time-outs to protect your account. You
will be logged out of the site automatically after a specified
period of inactivity. This time-out feature reduces the risk of
others being able to access your account if you leave your computer
unattended.</p>

<p>Protection of account numbers</p>

<p>When we contact you about your account to confirm a funds
transfer, we only reference the last four digits of your bank
account number; this is done for your protection so that you will
recognize the source or destination account as one which you
own.</p>

<p>Passwords</p>

<p>At a minimum, we require the use of both numbers and letters in
your password. We have also instituted secure steps by which you
can regain access to your account should you forget your password,
including the use of a security question. Your password is not
known to any employee or third party with whom we may partner, and
we will never ask for your password as a means of identifying
yourself. You should never share your password with anyone, and if
you ever receive an email purporting to come from Prosper that asks
for your password, you should immediately report this
development.</p>

<p>What you can do</p>

<p>In addition to our own substantial efforts, you can take several
precautions to protect the security of your computer and personal
information. For instance, you can start by using a well-chosen
password. You should avoid using any information that others can
easily learn about you, such as a family member's name or birthday,
and you can also use special characters in place of letters. In
addition, we recommend that you change your password
frequently.</p>

<p>You can install and regularly update antivirus and firewall
software to protect your computer from external attacks by
malicious users. When you are finished with a session on our site,
be sure that you log out and close the browser window.</p>

<p>To protect your account, we send automatic notifications
confirming certain actions taken on your account, such as changes
to a password or external linked account. We do this for your own
protection so that you can be sure no one else is making changes to
your account without your knowledge. However, the security offered
through these notifications can be undermined if other people have
access to your email account. Therefore, you might consider
restricting access to the email account you registered with on this
site and/or changing your password on that email account
frequently.</p>

<p>If you use a computer that is accessed by other people, such as
in a public library or Internet cafe, we recommend that you take
special precautions to protect the security of your account and
personal data. When you are finished using our site, you should log
out completely, then close the browser window and clear the
browser's cache files.</p>

<p>You should also be aware of fraudulent attempts to gain access
to your account information known as "phishing." Phishing is a
tactic used by scammers in which unsuspecting people are brought to
a website by a genuine-looking email purporting to be from a
legitimate company. The phony or "spoof" email takes the person to
a website that looks legitimate but in fact is not. Either in the
email itself or on this fake site, scammers will ask for login
information to gain access to people's accounts and withdraw their
money. Prosper will never ask you for your login information in the
context of any email. In general, you can protect yourself against
phishing by never providing personal or login information via an
email-instead, go the website directly. You might also make it a
habit to check the URL of a website to be sure that it begins with
the correct domain. In the case of Prosper, you should always
ensure the URL begins with http://www.prosper.com,
https://www.prosper.com or http://blog.prosper.com.</p>

<p>Changes to This Policy</p>

<p>If we make updates to this privacy policy, we will update the
privacy policy with the changes and revise the "last updated"
information posted at the bottom of this privacy policy. Any
updates to the privacy policy become effective when we post the
updates on the website.&nbsp; If we make any material changes we
will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in
your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the
change becoming effective. Your use of the website following the
update to the privacy policy means that you accept the updated
privacy policy.</p>

<p>For additional information, or if you have any questions
regarding this policy or the privacy practices at Prosper, please
submit your questions or comments directly to <a href="mailto:privacy@prosper.com">privacy@prosper.com</a> via
email. Any personal information you submit will be used solely to
respond to your requests.</p>

reserved.</p>

<p>**All personal loans are made by WebBank, a Utah-chartered
Industrial Bank, Member FDIC. All Prosper personal loans are
unsecured, fully amortized personal loans.</p>

<p>Notes offered by Prospectus. Notes investors receive are
dependent for payment on personal loans to borrowers. Not
FDIC-insured; Investments may lose value; No Prosper or bank
guarantee. Prosper does not verify all information provided by
borrowers in listings. Investors should review the prospectus
before investing.</p>

<p>*Seasoned Return calculations represent historical performance
data for the Borrower Payment Dependent Notes ("Notes") issued and
sold by Prosper since July 15, 2009. To be included in the
calculations, Notes must be associated with a borrower loan
originated more than 10 months ago; this calculation uses loans
originated through May 31, 2012. Our research shows that Prosper
Note returns historically have shown increased stability after
they've reached ten months of age. For that reason, we provide
"Seasoned Returns", defined as the Return for Notes aged 10 months
or more.</p>

<p>To calculate the Return, all payments received on borrower
loans, net of principal repayment, credit losses, and servicing
costs for such loans, are aggregated and then divided by the
average daily amount of aggregate outstanding principal. To
annualize this cumulative return, it is divided by the
dollar-weighted average age of the loans in days and then
multiplied by 365.</p>

<p>All calculations were made as of September 30th, 2013. Seasoned
Return is not necessarily indicative of the future performance on
any Notes.</p>
