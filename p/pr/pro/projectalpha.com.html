  <p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Under
  California Law, California residents may have the right to request in
  writing from businesses with whom they have an established business
  relationship: (a) a list of the categories of Personally Identifiable
  Information and the type of services provided to the customer, that a
  business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that
  are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding
  calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes and
  (b) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To make such

  <p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>2. INFORMATION WE
  	COLLECT THROUGH THE DIGITAL SERVICE</b></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Collection
  of Usage Information.</b>&nbsp;When
  users use the Digital Service (including by accessing its associated
  Website and/or Mobile Applications), we automatically collect “Usage
  Information” which include among other things, which pages of our
  Website or sections of our Mobile Applications were visited; the
  order in which they were visited; when they were visited; which
  hyperlinks were “clicked”; your activity on the Digital Service
  (such as title selections, watch history and search queries); and
  details regarding your interactions with customer service (such as
  the date, time and reason for contacting us, transcripts of any chat
  conversations, and if you call us, your phone number).   We also
  collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our
  Website or to access our Mobile Applications. Collecting such
  information may involve logging the IP address or other unique
  identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer, mobile phone,
  tablet, gaming system, smart TV, set top box, or other device (any, a
  “Device”) used to access the Website, Mobile Applications or
  other components of the Digital Service, operating system and browser
  software used by each user of the Digital Service.  Although such
  information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we may be
  able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service
  Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of
  connectivity. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device
  Identifier with your Personally Identifiable Information, we will
  treat it as Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><font><font><b>Technology
  Used on the Digital Service.</b></font></font><font><font>&nbsp;
  We also use or may use cookies, web beacons and/or embedded scripts
  to help us determine and identify repeat visitors, the type of
  content and sites to which a user of our Digital Service links, the
  length of time each user spends at any particular area of our Digital
  Service, and the specific functionalities that users choose to use.
  Essentially, cookies are a user’s identification card for the LDN
  servers.  Web beacons are small graphic files linked to our servers
  that allow us to track your use of our Digital Service and related
  functionalities. An embedded script is programming code that is
  designed to collect information about your interactions with the
  Digital Service, such as the links you click on. The code is
  temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a
  third party service provider, is active only while you are connected
  to the Digital Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</font></font></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><font><font>Cookies,
  web beacons and embedded script allow LDN to serve you better and
  more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at our Digital
  Service. Cookies, web beacons and embedded script are not used to
  retain Personally Identifiable Information. You should be able to
  control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser.
  Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to
  reject cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar. If you
  reject our cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of the
  Digital Service may not work properly, but you do not have to accept
  our cookies in order to use many functionalities of the Digital
  Service.</font></font></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><font><font>California
  Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b)(as amended effective
  January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to
  know how LDN responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. LDN
  does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals
  because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed.
  We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once
  one is created.</font></font></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><font><font><b>Collection
  of Personally Identifiable Information.</b></font></font><font><font>&nbsp;In
  order to access certain features and benefits on our Digital Service,
  you may need to submit “Personally Identifiable Information”
  (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally
  Identifiable Information can include information such as your name,
  address, telephone number and email address. You are responsible for
  ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you
  submit to LDN.  Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use
  the Digital Service, the information you receive when using the
  Digital Service, and our ability to contact you. For example, your
  email address should be kept current because that is one of the
  primary manners in which we communicate with you. We may collect
  Personally Identifiable Information in connection with various
  functionality and services offered via the Digital Service, including
  the following:</font></font></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><font><font><b>(a) Updates
  	and Newsletters.</b></font></font><font><font>&nbsp;LDN
  	may offer you the ability to receive email updates and newsletters.
  	In order to subscribe to these services, you may be required to
  	provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your
  	name, email address and zip code.</font></font></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><font><font><b>(b) Participation
  	in Contests, Sweepstakes, and Other Promotions.</b></font></font><font><font>&nbsp;LDN
  	may offer you the opportunity to participate in a contest,
  	sweepstakes, or other promotions on or through the Digital Service.
  	If you desire to participate in any such contest, sweepstakes, or
  	other promotion, you will be asked to provide us with certain
  	information necessary to conduct such contest, sweepstakes, or other
  	promotion. This information may include, among other things, your
  	name, age, mailing address, email address, and phone number.</font></font></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><font><font><b>(c) Communications

  <p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><font><font><b>(d) Social
  	Media Interaction.</b></font></font><font><font>&nbsp;We
  	may receive Personally Identifiable Information when you engage with
  	our Digital Service on or through third-party social networking
  	sites, such as Facebook or Twitter, and allow us to have access to
  	information from your profile (e.g., name, email address, photo,
  	gender, birthday, location, friends, followers, the posts or the
  	‘likes’ you make). You can control what data you share through
  	privacy settings available on some social networking sites. For more
  	information about how you can customize your privacy settings and
  	how such third-party sites treat your Personally Identifiable
  	Information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of
  	use.</font></font></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><font><font><b>(e) Metadata.</b></font></font><font><font>&nbsp;Metadata
  	is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For
  	example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User
  	Content was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can
  	add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a
  	hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag
  	(e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data.
  	This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more
  	interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using
  	other’s APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with
  	the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature)
  	if you make your photo public by posting it on our Digital Service.</font></font></p>
