<h3>TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Tracking Pixels</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on the Site to help customize the Site and improve your experience. When you access the Site, your personal information is not collected through the use of tracking technology. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can remove or reject cookies, but be aware that such action could affect the availability and functionality of the Site. You may not decline web beacons; however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or by modifying your web browser's settings to notify you each time a cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.</p>
<p>Periodically, we may need to include a tracking pixel to monitor the effectiveness of information or materials we share. For example, you may subscribe to our newsletter, which may be used for advertising purposes. Newsletters sent may contain tracking pixels. The pixel is embedded in emails and allows for an analysis of the success of online marketing campaigns. Because of these tracking pixels, we may see if and when you open an email and which links within the email you click. Also, this allows the Site to adapt the content of future newsletters to the interests of the user. We do not share this information with third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Internet-Based Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party software to serve ads on the Site, implement email marketing campaigns, and manage other interactive marketing initiatives. This third-party software may use cookies or similar tracking technology to help manage and optimize your online experience with us. For more information about opting out of internet-based ads, visit the third-party network or review <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Tool</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Website Analytics</strong></p>
<p>We partner with selected third-party vendors, such as Google Analytics, to allow tracking technologies and remarketing services on the Site through the use of first party cookies and third-party cookies, to, among other things, analyze and track users’ use of the Site, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity.

You are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions. We do not transfer personal information to these third-party vendors. However, if you do not want any information to be collected and used by tracking technologies, you can visit the third-party vendor or review <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Tool</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>You should be aware that getting a new computer, installing a new browser, upgrading an existing browser, or erasing or otherwise altering your browser’s cookies files may also clear certain opt­out cookies, plug­ins, or settings.</p>
<h3>THIRD-­PARTY WEBSITES</h3>

<p>We currently use the following and may add additional third-parties at any time:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amazon</span>&nbsp;for tracking sales generated from clicks to retailer(s) on the Site to assign commission from those sales.&nbsp;Please refer to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=468496">Amazon Associate's privacy policy</a> for further information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information.

<p>Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes or to complete transactions, or when required by law.</p>
<h3>SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>At no time should you submit sensitive personal information about yourself or anyone else to the Site. This includes your social security number, information regarding race or ethnic origin, political affiliation or opinions, religious beliefs, health information, criminal background, or other sensitive personal information.

<h3>POLICY FOR CHILDREN</h3>
<p>Pro Game Guides is designed for those 18 years of age or older. Visitors under the age of 18 must have permission from their parent or guardian to use certain features of our Site. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us through <a href="https://www.progameguides.com/contact-us/">our contact form</a>.</p>
<h3>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
<p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have provided your personal information with the Site, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Site.
