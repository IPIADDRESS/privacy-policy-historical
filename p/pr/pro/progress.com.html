<p>We at Progress Software Corporation ("Progress Software") are constantly striving to provide excellent service to you, our customers and business partners, while building a long-lasting relationship with you. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information about you when you visit our site.</p> 

<p>When you visit our web sites, you might be providing information about your visit on two levels:</p>

<ul class="plain">
  <li>Statistics collected as you browse our Web sites.</li>
  <li>Organizational and personal information you knowingly give us.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because Progress Software respects your right to privacy, we want you to be aware of how we handle this information.</p>

<p class="subhead">Our Commitment to Your Privacy</p>

<p>Progress Software assures you that we do not</p> 
<ul class="plain">
  <li>Provide or sell the names and addresses of our customers [site users] to outside vendors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Progress Software does:</p>

<ul class="plain">

<p class="subhead">Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</p>

<p><b>Statistics Collected as You Browse Our Web Sites</b></p>

  <li>From which domains our visitors come (e.g., "yahoo.com" or "aol.com").</li>
