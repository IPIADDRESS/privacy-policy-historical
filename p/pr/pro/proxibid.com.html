            <p class="textbold">OVERVIEW</p>
            <p class="text">Proxibid’s purpose is to provide bidders 
              an opportunity to participate in live auctions even when they 
              cannot be physically present at the auction site. Proxibid 
              webcasts the live auction and allows bidders to place bids 
              in real time. Proxibid can also place automated bids on behalf 
              of a bidder unable to personally monitor the auction webcast.<br>
              Proxibid collects information from you to create your Bidder 
              Profile. This Bidder Profile allows Proxibid to verify your 
              identity and contact you regarding your auction activity.</p>
            <p class="text">All auctions are operated by independent Auction 
              Houses. Proxibid only facilitates your access to these Auction 
              Houses when you are unable to attend in person. The Auction 
              Houses have their own rules and requirements for participating 
              in each auction. You may be required to submit information 
              to the Auction House before participating in an auction. This 
              information is governed by the Auction House’s privacy 
              policy, not Proxibid’s privacy policy. Before you submit 
              any information to an Auction House, you should review that 
              Auction House’s privacy policy to understand how your 
              information will be handled.</p>
            <p class="text">Proxibid does not have any control over operation 
              of the actual auctions. Proxibid only facilitates the web 
              connection between the Auction site and you, the Bidder.</p>
            <p class="textbold">INFORMATION COLLECTED BY PROXIBID</p>
            <p class="text">Proxibid collects contact information to sign 
              you up as a Bidder. That information is provided to the individual 
              Auction Houses when you select to apply for participation 
              in one of their auctions. Proxibid needs the following information 
              for every Bidder using proxibid.com:</p>
            <p class="text">Name:<br>
              Address:<br>
              E-mail:<br>
              Home Phone Number<br>
              Work Phone Number<br>
              Affirmation that you are over the age of 21<br>
              Credit Card Billing Address</p>
            <p class="text">Proxibid does not collect any information about 
              individual Bidders other than the information provided directly 
              to us in connection with Bidder Profiles.</p>
            <p class="text">We do gather aggregate information about site 
              usage, such as the number of visitors, most visited pages, 
              and length of visit. However, this information does not identify 
              Bidders specifically by IP address, e-mail address or other 
              user identifier. Rather, it tells us how our Bidders as a 
              group are using the site. Thus, aggregate site usage data 
              helps us expand and improve the Proxibid web site in order 
              to make your experience with Proxibid the best possible.</p>
            <p class="text">You may be required to submit additional information 
              to participate in certain auctions. Each individual Auction 
              House determines what information you will be required to 
              submit to participate. This information is submitted through 
              our website and stored in our database. The information is 
              passed on to the Auction House requiring it. Any information 
              received by the Auction House is governed by the Auction House’s 
              privacy policy, not Proxibid’s privacy policy. We provide 
              a direct link to each Auction House’s Privacy Policy 
              from the Proxibid website. We suggest that you review the 
              individual Auction House’s Privacy Policy before you 
              submit any personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p class="text">We do not sell, trade or rent any of your information. 
              Other than the contact information we provide to the Auction 
              Houses, we do not provide any of your information to a third 
              party, unless you expressly give permission to do so. Thus, 
              your personal information is only used to help you participate 
              in live auctions.</p>
            <p class="text">Please rest assured that Proxibid has taken 
              adequate precautions to protect both the physical and electronic 
              security of collected information and other data.</p>
            <p class="textbold">COOKIES</p>
            <p class="text">Proxibid, Inc. only collects information pertaining 
              to session cookies and does not store any persistent cookies 
              on your computer hard drive. A cookie is a small piece of 
              information that is sent to your browser-- along with a Web 
              page-- when you access a Web site.</p>
            <p class="text">There are two kinds of cookies. A session cookie 
              is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your computer's 
              RAM. Because a session cookie is never written to a drive, 
              it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. A persistent 
              cookie is a more permanent line of text that gets saved by 
              your browser to a file on your hard drive. Depending on your 
              browser settings, you may receive notification that a given 
              site is requesting cookie information, possibly with an expiration 
              date. Persistent cookies have an expiration date in the future. 
              Session cookies have no date associated with them. Proxibid.com 
              uses ABSOLUTELY NO persistent cookies. The site DOES however 
              require the 'session cookie'. Accessing any and all of Proxibid's 
              web pages will create a session cookie. And it is indeed required 
              for any and all of the pages to work. But as stated above, 
              it is only stored in memory for as long as you have your browser 
              window open.</p>
            <p class="textbold">SECURITY</p>
            <p class="text">Proxibid takes industry standard security measures 
              to protect your information. Proxibid has contracted with 
              First Technology Solutions to provide security for Proxibid’s

              and contact information within the company to only those authorized 
              employees who need to use that information for a specific 
              job function.</p>
            <p class="text">Though Proxibid takes the multiple electronic 
              and physical security precautions described herein, we cannot 
              be responsible if a third-party gains access to the database 
              or your personal or credit card information by evading our 
              security measures.</p>
