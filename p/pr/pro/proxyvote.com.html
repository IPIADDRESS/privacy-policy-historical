<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This ADP site, like many other
commercial websites, utilizes a standard technology called "cookies"
to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help
a website determine that a particular user had visited the site previously and
thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was
browsing the site. Cookies are small strings of text that websites can send to
your browser. Cookies cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or
obtain your e-mail address. If you are simply browsing an ADP informational
site, a cookie may be used to identify your browser as one that has visited the
site before. If you are a registered user of a site providing service to ADP
clients (and have a user ID and password), we may use cookies so that we can
provide personalized information based on preferences you have indicated while
using the site. Although you have the ability to modify your browser to either
accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it
may not be possible to utilize ADP services which require registration if you
reject cookies.&nbsp;</span>

consented to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information
as described in this Privacy <o:p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Statement. The personal information collected at this
site is collected on behalf of the financial institution with which you have an
account or the corporation in which you own registered shares, to enable ADP to
provide the electronic voting service that you are electing to use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We may provide this information directly to, or use this information at
the direction of, such financial institution or corporation and they would
direct the use of this information in accordance with their practices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>ADP treats the personally identifiable information that ADP collects as
confidential and it is only used to carry out the services and activities
described on this web site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><b><u>We
do not sell or rent personal information collected through this site to anyone.</u></b>
Also, ADP may provide aggregate voting statistics or statistics relating to
visits to our sites and enrollment in the electronic voting program, but these
statistics will include no personally identifying information. ADP may also
disclose information in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such
action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal
process; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; or (c) enforce the Terms
and Conditions of use.<o:p>

corporation in which you own stock makes other electronic services available, we
may contact you by e-mail regarding the availability of such services. We may
also contact you by e-mail in connection with this service, such as providing a
confirmation of your voting instructions. <o:p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We exercise great care to protect your personally
identifiable information. This includes, among other things, using industry
standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site
monitoring. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your
personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of
any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true
for information you transmit to us via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that
information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our
best effort to ensure its security on our servers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Internally, we will restrict access to your personally identifiable
information to employees who need access to the information in order to do their
jobs. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy
policies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We will review our
security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate.<o:p>
