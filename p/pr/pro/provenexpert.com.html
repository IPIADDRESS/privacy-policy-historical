If we agree to your request, we will delete your data, but we will generally assume that you wish your name to be included in the list of persons that do not want to be contacted. In this way, we minimize the chance that you will be contacted in the future should your data be collected separately under other circumstances. If you do not wish this, please let us know.</li>
                    <li class="mb20"><strong>Right to restrict processing</strong><br>Instead of requesting deletion, you can also request from us that the processing of your data be restricted or blocked. We will also reply to this request within 30 days, except if we still need the data, for example in order to continue to provide our services to you or to ensure the protection of our intellectual property.</li>
                    <li class="mb20"><strong>Right to data portability</strong><br>Should you wish, you have the right to transfer your data from us to another person responsible.

                <p class="mb20">Our websites/web services use "cookies". Cookies are small text files that are saved on the hard drive of your PC (client) for a defined period.<br><br>

Most cookies we use are deleted at the end of the browsing session (known as session cookies).<br>
Other cookies stay on your computer and allow us to recognize your computer on your next visit ( (permanent or persistent cookies).<br>
Cookies usually contain a "cookie ID". This is a pseudonymized date in the form of a unique cookie identification.<br>
It consists of a series of characters that can be used to associate websites and the servers with a specific Internet browser (client) in which the cookie is saved.<br><br>

Cookies are generally distinguished into first and third party cookies.<br><br>

First party cookies will only be assigned by the website that you are currently on (for example, the website under the domain provenexpert.com).<br>
Expert Systems AG uses first party cookies for essential website functions, like for storing website settings, restoring sessions and for securing your session data.<br><br>

Within this process, access only occurs in impersonalized form and exclusively when you visit our website. Other websites cannot access this information.<br>
To ensure the data security of our visitors, it is necessary to allow first party cookies in order to use provenexpert.com
.<br><br>

Third party cookies are set by a third party provider that has been authorized by Expert Systems AG, i.e. not by the actual website that you are currently viewing.<br><br>

By using these cookies, we can adjust our offers to best meet customer preferences and can make browsing our site as convenient as possible for you (advertising, conversion tracking and personalization).<br><br>

In addition, we use third party providers in order to collect online statistics (analytics) as a basis for measuring the success of our advertising offers and subsequently improving them.<br>
Even when cookies from third party providers are used, data is only accessed in an anonymized form.<br><br>

An overview of third parties on our websites can be found here in the section entitled <a onclick="$.scrollTo('#section3partB', 400, );">"Use and application of third party tools and services on our websites"</a>.<br><br>

All essential services from our website/web services essentially work without the use of third party cookies.<br><br>

You may prevent the installation of cookies anytime by selecting the option "Do not accept cookies" in your browser. In addition, you can at any time delete cookies via your Internet browser or another software program. This can be done with any standard Internet browser.</p>

                <br>
                <p id="section3partAchapter1" style="font-size:24px;"><b>1. What personal data do we collect?</b></p>
                <p class="mb20"><strong>General personal data of our users &amp; Customer data:</strong><br>
We collect some data about our customers and users that we require to deliver our products and implement contracts and for license management. We therefore require your name, your email address and country of residence in order to create a user account, which is then used to order service packages. The same information is collected when you register for our newsletter. We may also require further information from you (e.g. address, telephone number or date of birth) to order of services. You may also provide us with further data - this is optional. The specific data collected depends on the form or input mask used, or as requested by our support staff over the phone.<br><br>

If for any reason we require additional personal data from you, we will let you know.<br><br>

We analyze the use of our products with Google Analytics. Here, specific computer data (including your computer's hardware key, processor name etc.) is used to create a pseudonymized profile, which collects usage data in order to improve our products. For more information on this topic can be found <a onclick="$.scrollTo('#section3partBchapter7', 400, );">here</a>.<br><br>

<strong>General personal data of evaluators of our users and customers:</strong><br>When you create reviews, we generally store only your email address and the associated log file as inventory data.<br>
You also have the option to enter your first and last name, which we will also save.<br>

<strong>Visitors to our websites:</strong><br>
 When normal Internet users visit our website, we save data to what are known as log files. Log files consist of the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider to the computer making the request for that session, as well as the name and version of the Internet browser being used to visit the website.<br><br>
 
 We also use our own session cookies when you visit our website. The information we obtain from these include the type and version of your Internet browser, the website from which you came to our website, which pages you visited on our website, as well as the date and duration of your visit.</p>
                <br>
                <p id="section3partAchapter2" style="font-size:24px;"><b>2. From whom is personal data collected?</b></p>
                <p class="mb20">We generally only collect your personal data directly from you.<br><br>

Exception:<br>
If you are a member of an association or other organization with which we have a framework agreement, we may collect your data related to that organisation.</p>
                <br>
                <p id="section3partAchapter3" style="font-size:24px;"><b>3. Why we collect personal data and what we use it for</b></p>
                <p class="mb20">User data:<br>
In general, we use information about our users or customers in the following ways:<br><br>

<strong>a) Advertising measures</strong><br>We may send you information at regular intervals that we believe to be of interest to you, and also inform you of certain discounts and special offers to which you are entitled as a result of your business relationship with us.
<br><br>

We require your consent for some aspects of these activities that are not covered by our legitimate interests (in particular for data collection using cookies and direct marketing to you through our digital channels). According to the circumstance, we will ask for your explicit consent via "opt-in" or silent consent via "soft opt-in" (see below).<br><br>

Consent via "Soft opt-in" is a specific form of consent that applies if you have had business dealings with us before (e.g. you have ordered a product from us or registered a domain with us) and we may advertise other products or services within this context. For consent via "soft opt-in", we will consider your consent as provided, as long as you do not withdraw it.<br><br>

You can revoke your consent at any time. For more information on this topic can be found <a onclick="$.scrollTo('#section3partCchapter7', 400, );">here</a>.<br><br>

Our advertising as a whole is based on entities that we consider to be especially helpful to our customers and users. However, we are aware that we do not always do things the right way for everybody. We may use your data to display you advertisements and other Expert Systems AG content on other websites, e.g. Facebook. If you do not wish your data to be used in this way, please change the cookie settings in your browser, as described above. Even if you deactivate advertisement cookies, it's possible that you may continue to receive Expert Systems AG advertisements. If this happens, it is because the advertisement is targeted towards an anonymous target group and not towards you specifically.<br><br>

<strong>b) Functionality of our products and protection of our intellectual property rights</strong><br>
We are dependent on protecting our intellectual property rights, not least for the purposes of being able to offer you our products and services at their usual standard of quality and at attractive prices.<br>

In order to enable you to use our products, a user account is necessary, where certain data must be obligatorily saved (name, email address and country).<br><br>

<strong>c) Assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims</strong><br>
In unusual cases, we may also use your personal data in order to assert, exercise or defend legal rights.<br><br>

We may use your personal data for these purposes if it corresponds with our legitimate interests. For more information on this topic and what that means can be found <a onclick="$.scrollTo('#section3partD', 400, );">here</a>.</p>

                <p class="mb20">Our websites collect a variety of general data and information each time one of their pages is loaded. This general data and information is saved to our server log files. Data that may be collected includes (1) browser types used and their versions, (2) operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our websites (what is known as a "referrer"), (4) subpages on our websites that are accessed by an accessing system, (5) date and time of visit to websites, (6) an Internet Protocol Address (IP address) and (7) any other similar data and information, that could serve as hazard prevention in the event of an attack on our information technological systems.<br><br>

No conclusions are drawn about the person concerned during the use of this general data and information. This information is required in order to (1) correctly transmit the content of our website, (2) optimize content of and advertising for our website, (3) guarantee the permanent functional operability of our information technology systems and technology for our website, and (4) in the event of a cyber attack, provide law enforcers with necessary information for prosecution.

                <p class="mb20">The Expert Systems AG newsletters contain what are known as tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in emails in HTML format for the purposes of recording and analyzing log files.

                <p class="mb20">We have integrated various third-party components on our websites. primarily for the purpose of optimizing your surfing experience and analyze user behavior on our websites. The following provides you with more information about this:<br><br>

<strong>a) Google</strong><br>
We use various services provided by Google, Inc. on our websites. The operator for the services of Google Remarketing is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. The following services are integrated into our websites:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mb20"><strong>Google Analytics (with anonymization function)</strong><br>
The Expert Systems AG has integrated Google Analytics components into its websites.<br>
The operator for Google Analytics components is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.<br>Google complies with the data protection provisions of the Privacy Shield agreement and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce's "Privacy Shield" program.<br>
https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI<br>
Expert Systems uses an anonymization function for web analysis via Google Analytics, which Google uses to shorten and anonymize the IP address of the Internet connection of the person concerned.
<br><br>

Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, organization and analysis of data on the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analytics service collects, among other things, data on which websites a person concerned came to a website from ("referrer" URLs), which subpages of the websites were accessed or how often and for how long a website was viewed. These web analysis metrics are mainly used as a data basis for optimizing the functions and contents of a website.<br>
Google Analytics sets a cookie on the computer of the person concerned. The definition of cookies has been provided above. Using cookies enables Google to analyze the use of our websites. Each time a user visits one of the pages of the websites that are operated by Expert Systems AG and upon which Google Analytics components are embedded, the Internet browser on the computer of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the Google Analytics components to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical procedure, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, which enables Google to trace the origin of the visitors and their behavior on the site, among other things.<br>
Cookies are used to store personal information, such as access time, the location from which access came and the frequency of visits to our websites by the person concerned. For every visit to our websites, this personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, will be transferred to Google in the United States of America. This personal data will be stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose the personal data collected through this technical process to third parties.<br>
You can prevent the setting of cookies by our websites, as described above, at any time via the settings for your Internet browser and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. This Internet browser setting will also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the computer of the person concerned. In addition, cookies that have already been set by Google Analytics can be deleted via your Internet browser or another software program.<br>
Furthermore, the person concerned has the option to object to and prevent the recording of data on the use of these websites by Google Analytics and the processing of this data by Google. To do so, the person concerned must download and install a browser add-on under the linkhttps://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. This browser add-on communicates to Google Analytics via JavaScript that data and information regarding visitors to websites may not be transferred to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on will be considered as an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the person concerned is at a later point in time deleted, formatted or reinstalled, the person concerned must reinstall the browser add-on in order to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the person concerned or another person under their authority, it is possible to reinstall or reactivate the browser add-on.<br><br>

Further information and the Google Analytics Privacy Policy can be viewed at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ and at http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html.</li>
                    <li class="mb20"><strong>Google AdWords</strong><br>
Google AdWords is an Internet advertising service that permits advertisers to place ads in Google search engine results and in the Google advertising network. Google AdWords enables advertisers to set predefined keywords: an advertisement will be displayed in Google search results only if the user's search engine results are relevant to the keywords. Within the Google advertising network, advertisements are distributed to thematically relevant websites by means of an automatic algorithm and predefined keywords.<br><br>

Google AdWords are used for the advertisement of our websites through the placement of interest-based advertisements on websites of other companies and in the search engines results for search engine Google, as well as the placement of third party advertisements on our website.<br><br>

Should a person arrive at our website via a Google advertisement, a "conversion cookie" will be placed on the computer of that user by Google. The definition of cookies has been provided above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after a limited period of time and is not used to identify the person concerned. If the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion cookie is used to determine whether certain subpages, such as the shopping basket of an online shop system, have been accessed on our website. The conversion cookie enables both us and Google to track whether a person who has placed an ad on our website has generated revenue, that is, whether they have completed or canceled a purchase of goods.<br><br>

The data and information obtained through the use of conversion cookies are used by Google to create statistics about visits to our website. These visitor statistics are in turn used by us to determine the total number of users who arrived at our website via AdWords advertisements, as well as the success rate of the corresponding AdWord advertisement, and to optimize our AdWords advertisements in the future. Neither our company nor the other clients of Google AdWords receive information from Google which could identify the person concerned.<br><br>

By means of conversion cookies, personal data is saved, for example the websites that have been visited by the person concerned. For every visit to our websites, therefore, personal data including the IP address of the Internet connection of the person concerned will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data will be stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose the personal data collected through this technical process to third parties.<br><br>

You can prevent the setting of cookies by our websites, as described above, at any time via the settings for your Internet browser and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. This Internet browser setting will also prevent Google from setting a conversion cookie on the computer of the person concerned. In addition, cookies that have already been set by Google AdWords can be deleted via your Internet browser or another software program.<br><br>

In addition, the person concerned can choose not to receive interest-based advertising from Google. To do this you need to go to www.google.de/settings/ads on each of the Internet browsers you use and modify the settings there.<br><br>

                    <li class="mb20"><strong>Google Optimize</strong><br>
Google Optimize is a service to carry out so-called A/B tests - primarily in the field of marketing.<br>
A, for example, is the original of a subpage of our website, B is a variant of this subpage in which a certain detail has usually been changed, e.g. the color of a button. In the comparison it is then analyzed with which color the button was clicked on more often.<br>

                <p class="mb20"><strong>b) Bing Ads</strong><br>
The Expert Systems AG has integrated Bing Ads into this website. Bing Ads is an Internet advertising service that allows advertisers to place ads both in Bing's search engine results and in the Bing advertising network. Bing Ads allows an advertiser to specify certain keywords in advance, which are used to display an ad in Bing's search engine results only when the user uses the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search result. Within the Bing advertising network, advertisements are distributed to thematically relevant websites by means of an automatic algorithm and predefined keywords.<br><br>

The operating company for Bing Ads' services is Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA.<br><br>

The purpose of Bing Ads is to promote our website by displaying interest-relative advertising on Bing.com (and websites operated by Bing such as MSN.com, Bing.de and Bing.co.uk), AOL and Yahoo.com (including websites operated by Yahoo). The search network also includes third-party websites operated by Microsoft and Yahoo consortium search partners.<br><br>

If you access our website via such an advertisement, a cookie is placed on your computer. A conversion cookie loses its validity after thirty days and is not used to identify the person concerned. If the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion cookie is used to determine whether certain subpages, such as the shopping basket of an online shop system, have been accessed on our website. The conversion cookie enables both Microsoft and us to track whether a person affected who came to our website via a Bing-Ads advertisement generated revenue, i.e., whether they completed or cancelled a purchase of goods.<br><br>

A Bing UET tag is integrated into our website. This is a code used in connection with the cookie to store personal information, such as the web pages visited by the person concerned. Personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is therefore transferred to Microsoft in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States of America each time he or she visits our website. This personal data is stored by Microsoft in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.<br><br>

In addition, Microsoft may be able to track your usage across multiple electronic devices through cross-device tracking, enabling you to display personalized advertising on or in Microsoft webpages and apps.<br><br>

You can disable this behavior at https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/ad-settings/ (Opt Out).<br><br>

The person concerned can prevent the saving of cookies through our website at any time, as already described above, by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. This Internet browser setting will also prevent Microsoft from setting a Bing Ads cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already stored by Bing Ads can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.<br><br>

Furthermore, the person concerned has the possibility to withdraw from interest-related advertising by Bing Ads. To do this, the person concerned must select the link https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/ad-settings/ from each of the Internet browsers they use and select the desired settings there.<br><br>

For more information on Bing Ads' analytics services, please visit the Bing Ads website (https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/de/53056/2). For more information about Microsoft and Bing's privacy policy, please see the Microsoft Privacy Policy (https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement).<br><br>

<strong>c) LinkedIn</strong><br>
LinkedIn is a social network for building and maintaining professional business contacts and offers tailored search functions and tools as part of its talent, marketing and sales offering. Users create a career profile that can be viewed privately and publicly according to their own wishes and settings (see profile settings for data protection and opt out).<br><br>

LinkedIn is operated by LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland.
<br><br>

As part of its service offering, LinkedIn collects public information (such as career-related news and achievements) and other content that may include information about the specific LinkedIn user (such as mentions in articles, posts, comments). You can choose to opt out of this. As a targeted social media network with millions of global users, LinkedIn is also a B2B advertising medium for companies through which different ad formats can be targeted to different users. LinkedIn does not share personal data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without the user's consent; see profile settings for advertisements and opt-out and opt-out for surveys and services).LinkedIn stores cookies and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixels, ad tags, device identifiers) to recognize the user and his or her platform both off- and on the platform. Users can restrict this tracking within the display preferences under the Guest Controls.<br><br>

Expert Systems AG operates its own LinkedIn profile to advertise career opportunities on the one hand, and to advertise specific Expert Systems products on the other. Every Expert Systems AG post on the company profile shows how many users have carried out a specific action organically or through paid advertising. Expert Systems AG also sponsors content via LinkedIn in the form of sponsored posts, text ads, and videos. In addition to the organic reach of the followers, these advertisements are aimed at specific target groups. Target groups can be created based on various targeting options, e.g. by location, professional title, skills, and interests. LinkedIn uses the user's own profile information and targets the individual user approvals that the user has configured in his profile. Expert Systems AG receives information on the effectiveness of advertisements by tracking user behavior via cookies and similar technologies. Depending on the advertising campaign, the LinkedIn Insight Tag and specific LinkedIn scripts installed on our homepage measure whether a specific product has been added to the shopping cart or purchased. If preferred, the user can limit this in the LinkedIn display settings.<br><br>

An overview of the Facebook plugins can be found here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.<br><br>

When you visit our pages, the plugin establishes a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server. Facebook receives the information that you have visited our site with your IP address. If you click the Facebook "Like" button while logged into your Facebook account, you can link the contents of our pages on your Facebook profile. This allows Facebook to associate the visit to our pages with your user account. We would like to point out that, as the provider of the pages, we have no knowledge of the content of the data transmitted or of their use by Facebook. For more information, please see Facebook's Privacy Policy at: https://de-de.facebook.com/policy.php.<br><br>

With the help of the Facebook pixel, Facebook is able to determine the visitors of our offer as a target group for the presentation of advertisements, so-called "Facebook ads". Accordingly, we use the Facebook pixel to display the Facebook ads we post only to Facebook users who have shown an interest in our website. This means that with the help of the Facebook pixel we want to make sure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of the users and are not a nuisance. The Facebook pixel also helps us track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by showing whether users have been redirected to our site after clicking on a Facebook ad.<br><br>

The Facebook pixel is integrated directly by Facebook when you visit our websites and can store a so-called cookie, i.e. a small file, on your device. If you then log in to Facebook or visit Facebook when logged in, the visit to our site will be recorded in your profile. The data collected about you is anonymous to us, so it does not provide us with any information about the identity of the user. However, Facebook stores and processes the data so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible. Facebook processes the data in accordance with Facebook's Data Usage Policy. Accordingly, you can find more information about how the remarketing pixel works and how Facebook ads are displayed in general in the Facebook Data Usage Policy: https://www.facebook.com/policy.php.<br>
You can object to the collection by the Facebook pixel and use of your data to display Facebook ads. To do this, you can visit the page set up by Facebook and follow the instructions on the settings for usage-based advertising: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads or declare the objection via the US page http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU page http://www.youronlinechoices.com/.

In addition, relevant offers and recommendations specific to your interests can be displayed, depending on which services, information and offers you have informed yourself about on our website. Furthermore, LinkedIn can compile statistics with aggregated data about the use and visit of our website. If you are a LinkedIn member, demographic information, such as your approximate location, may also be collected.

                <p id="section3partDchapter1" style="font-size:24px;"><b>1. Legitimate interest</b></p>
                <p class="mb20">According to Article 6 (1) f) of the GDPR, we are permitted to process your data even without express consent, provided that if this is necessary to safeguard our legitimate interests or those of a third party, as long as your interests or your fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of personal data, do not outweigh this.<br><br>

We do not believe that the following activities adversely affect persons in any way. On the contrary, they help us provide more tailored and efficient services to you and are therefore beneficial to all parties. However, you still have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on this basis, as mentioned above.<br><br>

<strong>User and customer data:</strong><br>
We must ensure that our business activities run smoothly, so that we can continue to provide you with our products and services of the usual quality and at a reasonable price. For this reason, we require your data in order to fulfill our contracts with you, to bill you for our services and supply you with our products, to answer your support queries and so that we can provide you with updates and patches for your software. Lastly, we also require your data in order to protect our intellectual property in the form of our software and content from misuse and piracy by using the data stored in your user account. It is therefore in our legitimate interests to use your data.<br><br>

We have our own legal obligations and it is in our legitimate interest to insist on their fulfillment. If we believe in good faith that this is necessary, we may therefore disclose your information for the purposes of law enforcement or tax collection or actual or threatened disputes.<br><br>

<strong>Evaluator data:</strong><br>
When you submit a review, we collect your personal data to prevent misuse (e.g. through multiple reviews).<br><br>

We collect a limited amount of information from visitors to our websites and use it to help you navigate our websites and better manage the services we offer. The data we collect in this way comprises information about how you use our website and how often you access it.</p>

                <p class="mb20">Under certain circumstances, we may need your consent to process your personal data in connection with certain activities. Depending on what exactly your data is needed for, we will either ask for your explicit consent via "opt-in" or silent consent via soft opt-in .<br><br>

According to Article 4(11) of the GDPR, consent (via opt-in) is classed as "any voluntary declaration of intent, in an informed and unequivocal manner, in the form of a declaration or other clear affirmative act, with which the person concerned indicates their consent to the processing of personal data concerning themselves". Put simply, this means that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mb20">you must voluntarily give us your consent without us putting any kind of pressure on you;</li>
                    <li class="mb20">you must know what you are granting consent for - we will therefore ensure that we have provided you with sufficient information; and</li>
                    <li class="mb20">you must give us your consent in the form of a positive, affirmative act. In most cases, we will provide you with a field that you must mark so that this requirement is clearly and unambiguously fulfilled.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb20">We keep a record of the consent that you have given in this way.<br><br>

As previously mentioned, in some cases consent by soft opt-in is sufficient. We may advertise products and services that are related to the products we offer (especially our software and the content we offer) and services (for example in the hosting area), provided that you have not actively unsubscribed from these communications.<br><br>

As previously mentioned, you have the right to revoke your consent to these activities. by contacting our data security officer <br><br></p>

This may occur, for example, if we require legal advice in relation to legal proceedings or are legally obliged to retain or disclose certain information in the course of legal proceedings.</p>
