        <p align="left" class="style75"><strong>Cookies </strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style75">A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style75"><strong> Log Files </strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style75">We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style75"><strong> Links </strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style75"> This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that ProFlightSimulator.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

        <p align="left" class="style75"><strong> Security </strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style75">This website takes certain precautions to protect our users' information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. However, there is unfortunately no way yet for the industry to guarantee that the information you transmit through the Internet is entirely secure. <br>
            <br>
  Users are responsible for securing the confidentiality of their password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under their password or account. It is strongly recommended that users take extra precautions when receiving files from unfamiliar third parties (i.e., via email), as they may be harmful. <br>
  <br>
  If you have any questions about the security at our website, please send us an e-mail. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style75"><strong> Special Offers </strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style75"> We may send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and newsletters or other useful communications. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style75"><strong> Site and Service Updates </strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style75">We may also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via e-mail or phone. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style75"><strong> Correction/Updating Personal Information </strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style75">If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you provided to us. This can be done by sending us an e-mail. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style75"><strong> Choice/Opt-out </strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style75">You are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out' of having your information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information within our site. For example, a contest may include an ‘opt-out' mechanism so users can participate in it without receiving any marketing material that may be connected to it. <br>
            <br>
  Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletters or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the "unsubscribe" link in any e-mail message, or by sending us an e-mail. </p>
