<h2><a name="1" id="1"></a>1. Who Are We?</h2>

Antrim, BT41 3AB.&nbsp; We are registering  with the Information Commissioner in accordance with the Data Protection Act  1998, Data Protection Registration no. <strong>PENDING</strong>.<br>
  Any personal information provided to or gathered by Property Pal  is controlled by Property Pal. Our trading names are EstateMate.com and Estate  Mate.<br>
  You can contact us by visiting our <a href="/contact">Contact Us</a> page and find  out a bit more about the company by visiting <a href="about.jsp">About Us</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="2" id="2"></a>2. Information We Need</h2>
<p>The information we learn from our customers helps us  personalise and continually improve your shopping experience on this website.  We use the information to handle orders, deliver products and services, process  payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional  offers, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us,  display content such as wishlists and recommend merchandise and services that  might be of interest to you. We also use this information to improve our store  and platform, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and enable third  parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.<br>
  We will never collect sensitive information about you without  your explicit consent. If we intend to transfer your information outside the  EEA (European Economic Area) we will always obtain your consent first. The  information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the  information that we hold about you by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@propertypal.com">support@propertypal.com</a>. If you find any  inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly.<br>
  Property Pal is committed to protecting your privacy and  security. We will ensure that any information we obtain and use will always be  held, used and transferred in compliance with all applicable data protection  rules.<br>
  We do collate statistics about site traffic, sales and other  commercial information which we pass on to trusted third parties to assist us  in improving the service we provide to you. However, none of this information  will identify individuals.<br>
  Information is kept securely in accordance with our internal  security policy and may be used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1. Process and deliver your       Order;</li>
  <li>2. Provide Customer Support       services to you;</li>
  <li>3. Provide you with an up       to date, efficient, and reliable service;</li>
  <li>4. Help prevent fraud (eg.       we may check credit card details with our credit agency and reserve the       right to refuse Orders on that basis. Your credit rating can be checked       for a nominal fee with the main UK agencies Equifax and       Experian);</li>
  <li>5. Open and run your Estate       Mate customer account;</li>
  <li>6. Provide a more personal       shopping experience.</li>

</ul>
<p>By making an Order and/or submitting your data to us you agree  to this use.</p>
<h2><a name="3" id="3"></a>3. Accounts &amp; Passwords</h2>
<p>Your account contains your delivery and billing details, email  preferences and a record of your orders. You will need your email address and  password to see or edit your personal details. Please note that we do not store  your credit card details online.</p>
<h2><a name="4" id="4"></a>4. Information We Gather</h2>
<p>Here are the types of information we gather.<br>
  Information You Give Us: we receive and store any information  you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to  provide certain information but then you might not be able to take advantage of  many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes  as responding to your requests, customising future shopping for you, improving  our stores, and communicating with you.<br>
  Automatic Information: we receive and store certain types of  information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we  use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your  web browser accesses this website. A number of companies offer utilities  designed to help you visit websites anonymously. Although we will not be able  to provide you with a personalised experience at this website if we cannot  recognise you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.<br>

  Email Communications: to help us make emails more useful and  interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open email from Estate  Mate if your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive  email or other mail from us, please adjust your email preferences in “My Page”. </p>
<h2><a name="5" id="5"></a>5. Security of Personal Information</h2>
<p>When you enter credit card information to this website our  secure servers ensure that all details are encrypted at your browser before  they are sent to us. During the order process we store your personal details on  secure servers. We store credit card details separately on servers that are not  reachable from the internet.</p>
<h2><a name="6" id="6"></a>6. Security Checks</h2>
<p>As part of our policy to protect against the fraudulent use of  credit cards, we carry out random security checks on orders. These can take  various forms, and may involve contacting you by telephone before your order is  processed.<br>
  From time to time it may be necessary for us to ask you to  provide a copy of a recent statement header for the card being used on your  order. Please note that we are only interested in confirming information  already provided on your order, i.e. the billing name and address and card  issuer details, and do not need to see actual transactions, which can be  covered up. In case you have any concerns regarding security, we can assure you  that all information is shredded as soon as we have confirmed the details  required.<br>
  We hope you appreciate that these measures are a necessary  precaution, undertaken in the interests of fraud prevention.</p>

<h2><a name="7" id="7"></a>7. Who Else May See Your Information</h2>
<p>Property Pal may, if required, pass on the details of your order  to UK Customs &amp; Excise.</p>
<h2><a name="8" id="8"></a>8. Data Controllers</h2>
<p>The Data Protection Act 1998 requires us, as registered Data  Controllers, to be open about our holding and use of personal data. It also  entitles individuals to find out from us what personal data is held about them  on computer, to have that information corrected or erased if it is inaccurate,  and to claim compensation if they can prove they have suffered damage from an  inaccuracy or breach of security. Property Pal is committed to upholding the  eight Data Protection Principles of good information handling practice.</p>
<h2><a name="9" id="9"></a>9. The Data Protection Principles</h2>
<p>As Registered data controllers, we must comply with the Data  Protection Principles in relation to the personal data we hold. Broadly they  state that personal data shall:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1. Be obtained and       processed fairly and lawfully.</li>

  <li>2. Be processed only for       limited purposes which are described in the register entry.</li>
  <li>3. Be adequate, relevant       and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which they are held.</li>
  <li>4. Be accurate and, where       necessary, kept up to date.</li>
  <li>5. Be held no longer than       is necessary for the purpose for which they are held.</li>
  <li>6. Be processed in       accordance with the data subjects' rights.</li>
  <li>7. Be surrounded by proper       security.</li>

  <li>8. Not be transferred to       countries outside the EEA without adequate protection.</li>
</ul>
<p>For further details about the Data Protection Act, please  contact The Information Commissioner: <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.ico.gov.uk/</a></p>
<h2><a name="10" id="10"></a>10. Cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies are a technology that can be used to provide you with  tailored information from a website. A cookie is an element of data that a  website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You  can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the  chance to decide whether to accept it.<br>
  Our site makes use of cookies. Cookies are used for the  following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Completing the user's       current activity</li>

  <li>Website administration</li>
  <li>Research and development</li>
</ul>
<p>This website uses cookies as part of the mechanism to hold the  contents of the shopping basket during each visit that you make to the site,  and as such we recommend that both permanent and session cookies be enabled.<br>
  There is no requirement to have 3rd party cookies enabled for  our site to work, however we may occasionally carry out market research, which  a third party may assist with, during which they may issue a cookie from our  site. Some of our carefully selected affiliate partners may also issue cookies  so that they can track sales at this website through them. If 3rd party cookies  are not accepted it does not affect the functionality of our site.</p>
<h2><a name="11" id="11"></a>11. How secure is Information About Me?</h2>
<p>We work to protect the security of your information during  transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts  information you input.<br>
  We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers  when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number  to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.<br>

  We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in  connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally  identifiable customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may  occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information  to you.<br>
  It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access  to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish  using a shared computer.</p>
<h2><a name="12" id="12"></a>12. What Information Can I Access</h2>
<p>Property Pal gives you access to a broad range of information  about your account and your interactions with this website for the limited  purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.</p>

If you have any concern about  privacy at this website, please email us a thorough description and we will try  to resolve the issue for you.<br>

  Our business changes constantly and our Privacy &amp; Security  Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use &amp; Sale will change also. We may  email periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have  instructed us not to, but you should check our website frequently to see recent  changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy &amp; Security Policy  applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand  behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our  policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information  collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>

  Examples of information we receive from other sources include:  updated address and geo-coding information from other third parties, which we  use to correct our records and position your properties on our site more  easily; search term and search result information from some searches conducted  through the web; and credit history information from credit bureaus, which we  use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or financial  services to some customers.</p>
