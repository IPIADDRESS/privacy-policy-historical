												<p>This Web site Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time so please check back periodically. The updated policy will be 
												displayed or linked to web pages at OLGC Web sites.
												</p><p><a name="qa01"><b>1. What information of yours do OLGC Web sites collect?</b></a><br> 
												The goal of OLGC's Web sites is to be your premier destination for OLGC lottery and gaming related information on the Internet
												. To achieve this goal, OLGC needs to collect information to understand what services and products best meet the needs of 
												our consumers.  OLGC collects two types of information, "anonymous information" and "personal information".
												</p><p>Anonymous information refers to information that is not about an identifiable individual. Each time a visitor comes to an 
												OLGC Web site, OLGC may collect information that is necessary to improve the overall quality of the visitor's online 
												experience.  OLGC may collect computer and connection information such as the visitor's IP address (e.g., whether the user 
												is logged on from a .ca, .com, .gov or .edu domain), referral data (e.g., the address of the last URL a user visited prior 
												to clicking through to an OLGC Web site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). 
												OLGC also collects aggregate statistics relating to page views to gauge the performance of certain areas of our Web sites. 
												OLGC collects this user information for purposes of product monitoring and continuous Web site improvement.  To collect and 
												analyze this information, www.OLGC.ca utilizes a log analysis tool.  Note that, www.OLGC.ca 
												utilizes a log analysis tool together with a data-tagging technique to compile their aggregate, non-personally identifiable 
												information.  Data tags allow OLGC to measure which software plug-ins our consumers are utilizing, thus resulting in more 
												effectively designed Web sites.
												</p><p>In addition to this anonymous information, OLGC may also collect information that is about an identifiable individual, 
												referred to within as personal information.  Personal information includes information that tells us specifically who you are, 
												such as your name and email address. 
												</p><p>OLGC collects personal information in the following ways from different parts of OLGC's Web sites:
												</p><ul>
													<li>Personal information is gathered when you voluntarily register with one of OLGC's Web sites. 
													Specific functionality, such as winning number email alerts, requires registration information in order to 
													provide the requested service. Upon registering, you will be asked to provide OLGC with your name, email address or 
													other information as requested.  Consumers can continue to utilize OLGC's Web sites without providing personal 
													information however customized functionality will not be available.
													</li><li>In addition to registration for services at OLGC Web sites, OLGC will ask you for other personal information when you enter a sweepstakes, 
													contest or promotion offered through an OLGC Web site.
													</li><li>If you contact the OLGC by email, we will keep a record of that correspondence, but only so that we may respond to the email. 
												</li></ul>

												<br>
												<p><a name="qa02"><b>2. What are "cookies" and does OLGC use them?</b></a><br> 
												A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard 
												drive of your computer.  This unique number identifies your browser, but not the individual, whenever you visit one of OLGC's 
												Web sites.  These cookies will NOT let a Web site know any personal information about you, such as your name and address.  
												Since these cookies are only text files, they cannot run on your computer, search your computer for other information or 
												transmit any information to anyone.  Cookies are used on many major Web sites. Many browsers are initially set up to accept 
												cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you have received a cookie, or to refuse to accept 
												cookies. 
												</p><p>To help serve you better, OLGC uses cookies to help us remember your choice of language preference, English or French, when 
												visiting, www.OLGC.ca.  In addition, cookies are utilized to set the pay-out calculator wager 
												amount.

												</p><p><a name="qa03"><b>3. Who is collecting the information?</b></a><br> 
												When you provide personal information at any OLGC Web site, that information is collected by OLGC.  OLGC may offer sweepstakes, 
												contests or promotions on OLGC Web sites.  These sweepstakes, contests or promotions may be operated by third parties on behalf 
												of OLGC, in which case personal information may be collected by such third party, or disclosed to such third party by OLGC. If 
												you do not want to have OLGC share your personal information for such purposes, you can choose not to opt-in to the sweepstakes, 
												contest or promotion.

													</li><li>If you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion through OLGC's Web sites, OLGC will use the personal information you provided to contact you in the event you win.

													</li><li>OLGC may disclose personal information where required by the operation of law or by a judicial or governmental body.
