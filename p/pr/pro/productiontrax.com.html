        also includes "Aggregate Information," which is described below 
        in the section titled "How Do We Use Non-Personally Identifiable 
        Information?" We may automatically collect certain types of Non-Personally 
        Identifiable Information from you when you use the Site. We may also collect

        <font color="#000000">Cookies. </font></strong><font color="#000000">A 
        cookie is a message that is sent to your browser from a Web server and 
        stored on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain Personally 
        Identifiable Information, such as your email address. We use cookies solely 
        to keep track of which shopping cart belongs to you when you shop on our 
        site. We use cookies only for the operation of our Site.<strong><br>
        <br>
        IP Address. </strong>An IP address is a number that is assigned to your 
        computer automatically when you use the Internet. We may collect IP addresses 
        for the purposes of systems administration, server problem diagnosis and 
        to compile aggregate information (such as how many visitors logged on 
        to the Site). When you visit a particular Web page on the Site, our servers 
        log your IP address. Your IP address is not linked to your Personally 
        Identifiable Information. IP addresses also help us to identify individual 
        users within our live support system.<strong><br>

        Pixels. </strong>Pixels, also called clear GIFs, are invisible files on 
        Web pages that you visit. If you visit a page on the Site that contains 
        a Pixel, the Pixel communicates with your computer to determine, among 
        other things, whether you have been to that page before or viewed a particular 
        advertisement. We may use Pixels to serve advertising, enhance site functionality, 
        and track usage of the Site.</font><strong><br>

        general, we will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information

        our Site, we may use the Personally Identifiable Information you provide 
        for shipping and billing purposes only, unless you expressly give us permission 
        to use it for promotional and marketing purposes. In addition, if you 
        purchase tracks from a composer, we may provide that composer with your 
        Personally Identifiable Information to enable that composer to contact 
        you or use for their internal record keeping. We may also use the Personally

        we need to disclose it to protect or enforce our rights or the rights 
        of our members, users, or other third parties. Without limitation of the 
        foregoing, we may disclose your information pursuant to our Intellectual
