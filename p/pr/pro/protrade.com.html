The personally identifiable information described above may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes. In the event you win a contest or sweepstakes, we will post publicly your name, the name of the contest or sweepstakes you won and the amount of your prize on the Site, such as on a winner's page. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes that is promoted on the Site and, as part of the contest or sweepstakes, may collect your information. In those cases (where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes), we have no control over the information collected. Thus, before participating, we urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy as applicable to the contest or sweepstakes.

In the Event that PROTRADE or a unit thereof merges with or is acquired by another company, the successor company will have access to the information maintained by PROTRADE, including customer account information, in order to continue to provide services, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described in "Changes to this Policy" below. <br>

You may receive occasional service announcements and administrative messages, for example, advance notice of any maintenance that might affect the Site. You cannot opt out of these types of "informational" rather than "promotional" communications. <br>

We also purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing customer database so we can better provide pertinent offers in which you would be interested. We use this information to enhance or overlay your profile. This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied to your personally identifiable information. A "profile" is stored information that we keep on individual customers that detail their preferences. Consequently, all of the collected information is tied to your personally identifiable information to provide better offers and improve the content of the Site for you. Your profile may be shared with our affiliates, subsidiaries and business partners. <br>
