                                cookies. Cookies automatically identify your Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make 
                                using the Site easier for you by saving your user ID, preferences and other convenient Site usage information. 
                                By tracking how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas are most utilized. Many 
                                improvements and updates to the Site are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies also allows
                                 you to customize your experience on the Site. Some of our advertising is placed by agencies that may use

                                you do not want to allow information to be collected through the use of cookies, you can generally opt out of 
                                providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser. However, some areas of the Site may not 
                                provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. <br>

                                Site and, as part of the contest or sweepstakes, may collect your information. In those cases (where

                                collected. Thus, before participating, we urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy 
                                as applicable to the contest or sweepstakes.

                            from fraud and verify your identity; (ii) that PROTRADE in good faith believes is necessary or appropriate 
                            to cooperate in investigations of fraud, intellectual property infringements or other activity that is illegal
                             or may expose us or you to legal liability, or to conduct investigations of violations of the Terms of Use; 
                            (iii) when required by law or to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant or other legal process; 
                            (iv) to comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of governmental authorities (including, 
                            without limitation, requests from the governmental agency authorities to view your personally identifiable information);
                             (v) to protect and defend PROTRADE, its subsidiaries and affiliates and any of their officers, directors, employees, 
                            attorneys, agents, contractors and partners, in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute; (vi) to prevent 
                            imminent physical harm; (vii) to share aggregated statistical or demographic data with our affiliates, business partners
                             or for public relations (this aggregated information is not enough to reveal your identity); (viii) to share data, 
                            including personally identifiable information about you, with our affiliates, subsidiaries and business partners that
                             are committed to serving your online needs and related services; and (ix) in the event that PROTRADE, or a unit 
                            thereof merges with or is acquired by another company. In the Event that PROTRADE or a unit thereof merges with or

                          <li> <strong>Informing You.</strong> We may communicate with our customers on a regular basis via e-mail and/or 
                            mail to provide requested services, newsletters to resolve any complaints and for general customer service, 
                            and by other means where applicable, such as to investigate any suspicious transactions. You may receive 
                            occasional service announcements and administrative messages, for example, advance notice of any maintenance 
                            that might affect the Site. You cannot opt out of these types of "informational" rather than "promotional" communications. <br>

                            files to create a profile of our customers. We also purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing 
                            customer database so we can better provide pertinent offers in which you would be interested. We use this information
                             to enhance or overlay your profile. This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied to your personally identifiable 
                            information. A "profile" is stored information that we keep on individual customers that detail their preferences. 
                            Consequently, all of the collected information is tied to your personally identifiable information to provide better
                             offers and improve the content of the Site for you. Your profile may be shared with our affiliates, subsidiaries 
                            and business partners. <br>
