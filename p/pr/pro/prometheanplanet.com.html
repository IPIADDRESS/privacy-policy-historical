Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and although we take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information, Promethean cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information managed by the ClassFlow Service or the Planet Site, whether transmitted to Promethean by you, the educational institution, or the teacher. Once we receive your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. We consider these security safeguards to be reasonable in the circumstances.<br><br>By agreeing to the this Privacy Policy, you agree to use the ClassFlow Service and the Promethean Planet Site at your own risk, and agree (to the maximum extent permitted by law) that Promethean shall not be liable if a security breach occurs, if the ClassFlow Service or the Planet Site malfunctions, or if information is misused or mismanaged in any way to your detriment or the detriment of a third party, whether by Promethean, the educational institution, a teacher, or an unauthorized third party. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Service or the Site.<br><br>In order to access any Personal Information, you must set up an account which is protected by a password for your privacy and security. We also use coding practices which take steps to prevent attack on our Service from web browsers and malicious scripts, by processing all actions through several permission verifications checks.</p><p>You can help protect against unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p><p><br>The ClassFlow Service and the Planet Site may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites (but you should read those third parties’ privacy policies to ensure you understand them).
