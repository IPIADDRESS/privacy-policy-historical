    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This privacy policy is designed to inform users of the Pregnancy.org website (the "Website") about how we gather and use personal information collected by us in connection with use of the Website.

In this policy, "user" or "you" means any person using the Website, whether by browsing the Website, submitting comments, videos, articles, blog entries or other content ("Content"), registering with us by creating an account, or participating in any other activities available through the Website. </p>
<p>NOTICE TO WEBSITE VISITORS FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES: Pregnancy.org and its servers are located in the United States and are subject to the applicable state and federal laws of the United States.  All personal information shared with or collected by or in connection with the Website will be stored in the United States and may be accessed by law enforcement authorities in the United States and/or as may be required by law.  If you choose to access or use the Website, you consent to the use and disclosure of information in accordance with this privacy policy and subject to such laws.</p>

All of this information is referred to in this Policy as "Personal Information".  </p>
<p>We may collect Personal Information from you in connection with sweepstakes, contests or other promotions which we may sponsor (collectively, “Promotions”) or make Personal Information available to Website visitors including your name, address, Promotion entrance information and any other Personal Information necessary to enter or be involved in a Promotion.</p>
<p>Web Tracking Information: We, and our third party service providers, may use web tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs in order to operate the Website efficiently and to collect data related to usage of the Website and to web and email marketing conducted by us or on our behalf. Such collected data ("Web Tracking Information") may include the address of the websites you visited before and after you visited the Website, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Website you visit and what links you clicked on, and whether you opened email communications we send to you. In order to collect Web Tracking Information and to make your use of the Website more efficient, we may store cookies on your computer. In addition, the third party ad networks ("Ad Networks") that we use to display advertising to you may also store their own cookies on your computer. We may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages on the Website or in email communications to collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Website or such email communications, and Ad Networks and Pregnancy.org's Contractors (as hereinafter defined) may also do so. We do not correlate Web Tracking Information to individual user Personal Information. Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to you. You may be able to modify your browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted when you use the Website, but this may affect the performance of the Website.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</strong></p>
<p>Personal Information: We will use and store Personal Information for the purpose of delivering the Website to you, and to enhance and analyze the operation of the Website. We may also use Personal Information for the internal operational and administrative purposes of the Website and/or your ability to access or use certain parts of the Website.</p>
<p>Promotions:  Personal Information collected in connection with Promotions may be used to administer, monitor or run the Promotion (including prize winner verification of identity and other verifications and assessments that we may, in our discretion and from time to time, make for the purposes of confirming that the integrity of the Promotion has been maintained), to award prizes, to enforce the rules and regulations of the Promotion and/or protect our legal rights in connection with the Promotion.  We may also use Personal Information for marketing/publicity purposes connected with the Promotion, to monitor and track the awarding of prizes, to publish a list of Promotion winners and to comply with any legal requirements associated with the Promotion.<br>
Aggregate Information: We will also use customer information to create aggregated data for analytical purposes. This statistical information does not contain any Personal Information and is used to understand our customer base and to better serve our market.</p>

This allows us to determine which features visitors like best to help us improve our Website, to personalize your user experience, and to measure overall effectiveness.</p>
<p>Legal Exception: Notwithstanding the above, we may use Personal Information and other information collected through the Website to the extent required by law or legal process, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements (including this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service) with you, or if, in our reasonable discretion, use is necessary to protect our legal rights or to protect third parties.

If you wish to opt out of promotional emails, you may do so by following the "unsubscribe" instructions in the email, or by editing your account settings as described below.

<p>(iv) when we have your consent to share the information.</p>
