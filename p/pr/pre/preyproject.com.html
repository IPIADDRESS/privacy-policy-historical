<h3>PRIVACY POLICY SUMMARY</h3>

<p>At, PREY your security and privacy are our priority.  We use a design based on data minimization and will only ask the most basic information for your account creation. We are transparent in the gathering and processing of your personal data. Consequently, we have decided to adhere the highest standard of privacy by complying with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and making those rights available to all of our users so you can know that both your devices and your data are safe with us. </p>

<p>We will NEVER request unnecessary information unless it is necessary to provide a better service. </p>

<p>We will NEVER sell your personal information or data from your devices to a third party.</p>

<p>We will NEVER enable the functionalities of our software without your prior consent or request. By adding a device to your account, location tracking is set to ON by default. You can change this at any time on your settings.</p>

<p>We will NEVER access your personal information or data from your devices without your prior consent and will do so solely for support purposes.</p>

<p>If you have any concerns about how we protect and process your data, please do not hesitate to contact us at privacy[at]preqhq.com.</p>

<h3>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

<h4>PREY ANTI-THEFT</h4>

<p>We only request the minimum amount of data to create your account, this includes your name and country; however, it is important to highlight that the only way for us to identify you as a user is through the e-mail you used to register, which will be the official channel of communication between us. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the basis for us processing personal data is the provision of a service. </p> 	
	
<p>Once the software is installed on your device the default settings for location awareness is “on”, this mean that your devices will send all location changes to our servers. You can set this option to “off” in which case we won’t ever get the location information of your devices unless they are set to missing or you specifically request it. Once a device is set to “missing” you can start receiving reports and have the camera take pictures, this option can be turned off in the report settings. A device marked as ‘missing’ sends technical identification data to our servers along with the geo-localization, images and files you decide to retrieve from it. </p> 

<h4>NEWSLETTERS</h4>

<p>Currently, we have two mailing lists, one for updates from our Blog with security and technology news and another one of commercial information for clients. You can unsubscribe of your subscriptions here. These lists are intended solely for our exclusive use and we do not disclose any information to third-parties. </p> 	

<p>We will provide an individual opt-out or opt-in choice before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.</p>

<p>To limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to privacy[at]preqhq.com.</p>

However, if you want your user name to be removed from your posts, you can contact us at privacy[at]prehq.com.</p>

<h3>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND WHO WE SEND INFORMATION TO</h3>	

<p>At Prey, we work with renowned international organizations to offer a better service and an enhanced user experience; thus, we must transfer some data to third-parties. Such transfers are specific and regulated as per the terms and conditions of each of such organizations that are obliged to provide the same level of security and protection we do, and report any issue to us. </p>	

<p>We use the services of Hotjar, Google Analytics and Google Adwords to obtain anonymized information about surfing our website. No personally identifiable information is sent, except for your IP address. Also, they get localization information and data from your browser. The purpose of this processing is to register visit and usability metrics. Cookies are used to obtain this information, which require your prior consent. </p>

<p>We use Kissmetrics to measure the interaction of our users with the application’s panel. We send your login data, including your e-mail, localization and search history. Cookies are used to obtain this information, which require your prior consent and it is intended solely for our exclusive use. </p> 

<p>We use Crashlytics and Bugsnag to obtain an anonymized record of the errors and bugs of our software. None of these reports contain Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<p>We use Facebook’s Pixel to obtain information about visits to our website and track our ads. Cookies are used to obtain this information, which require your prior consent. Facebook fully complies with the GDPR. </p>

<p>We use Hubspot as a platform to administer the commercial information of our clients.

In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Prey is potentially liable.</p>

<h3>FILE RETRIEVAL AND PRIVACY</h3>

<p>Under no circumstance, our file retrieval functionality constitutes a back-up or administration system in the Cloud. We do not check nor do we have access to the files you retrieve, and we will never check their content. If you use the retrieval functionality, files are hosted in Google Cloud Storage and we do not have access to that information. Your files will be available during fifteen (15) days from the retrieval request. </p>	

<h3>AUTHORIZED USE AND MULTI-USER ACCOUNTS</h3>

<p>Prey Anti-Theft is a security application aimed at facilitating the search for and access to lost devices of our users. The purpose of Prey-Anti-Theft is not to register or track people down, and according to our terms and conditions, you agree to such limitations.  Likewise, you may only install Prey in devices you are legally authorized to do so. </p>

At any time, you can know who the administrators of your account are by checking your account’s information in the application’s panel. If you have any problems with this functionality or you would like access to administrators to be removed contact us at privacy[at]preyhq.com</p>
	
<h3>EXERCISE OF YOUR RIGHTS</h3>

<p>At Prey, we respect your ownership over your personal data; therefore, you can exercise your right to access, modify and remove it easily from the Panel. If you wish to cancel the processing of your personal data, you only have to uncheck your devices as lost because Prey does not make passive tracking of your devices, unless you expressly require it. If you decide to remove the personal data associated with your Prey account, you can do so in the Panel. If you wish to request the removal of all your personal data, you can request a full data deletion by sending an email to privacy[at]preyhq.com. Such requests can only be made once every five (5) months. </p>

You can exercise this right once every three (3) months; through the user panel or by sending a request to privacy[at]preyhq.com.</p>	

<p>If you decide to close an account, we delete all your data. Nevertheless, we keep a record of payment history, data deletion and portability requests as a backup for legal reasons. The lawfulness of these backups is based on the compliance of a legal obligation.</p>
