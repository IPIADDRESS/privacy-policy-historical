         <p>Ottaway Newspapers, Inc., the parent company of Ottaway Newspaper
         Group, and its affiliates (collectively referred to as
         "Ottaway", "we", "us" or "our",
         as applicable) are committed to maintaining the privacy of personal
         information that you provide to us when using their respective web
         sites (the "Ottaway Web Sites"). This Privacy Policy
         describes how we treat personal information received about you when you
         visit the Ottaway Web Sites.</p>
         <b><u>
         <p>Information Collected</p>
         </u>
         </b><p><b>Web Site Usage Information</b>: We automatically collects IP
         addresses and web site usage information from you when you visit the
         Ottaway Web Sites. This information helps us in evaluating how our
         visitors use and navigate the Ottaway Web Sites on an aggregate basis,
         including the number and frequency of visitors to each page of the
         Ottaway Web Sites, and the length of their visits.</p>
         <b>
         </b><p><b>Special Features</b>: When you use some of the special features of
         the Ottaway Web Sites and at other times, we may collect personally
         identifiable information from you that may include your name, age,
         address, e-mail address, credit-card number and facts about your
         interests and similar information.</p>
         <b>
         </b><p><b>Surveys and Form</b>: We may conduct occasional online surveys or
         ask you to fill in forms. For example, when you are within the Ottaway
         Web Sites, you may see a pop-up window offering you the optional
         opportunity of participating in a survey. These surveys and forms are
         entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.</p>
         <b>
         </b><p><b>Children: </b>We do not knowingly collect information from children
         under the age of 13 although certain third party sites that we link to
         may do so. These third-party sites have their own terms of use and
         privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to
         monitor their childrenâ€™s Internet usage and to help enforce our
         Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide
         information on the Ottaway Web Sites without their permission.</p>
         <b><u>
         <p>How We Use Information Collected</p>
         </u></b>
         <p>We may use information that you provide us in the following ways:</p>
         <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
               <ul>
                  <li>For the purposes for which you specifically provided the
                     information, for example, when you request that additional
                     information be sent to you, we will use your personal
                     information to process your request.</li>
                  <li>To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing
                     services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you.</li>
                  <li>To allow us to personalize the content and advertising
                     that you and others see based on personal characteristics
                     or preferences.</li>
                  <li>To enhance existing features or develop new features,
                     products and services.</li>
                  <li>To provide advertisers and other third parties with
                     aggregate information about our user base and usage
                     patterns.</li>
               </ul>
            </blockquote>
         </blockquote>
         <p>We may combine the information that we collect from you on the
         Ottaway Web Sites with information that you provide to us in connection
         with your use of our other products, services and web sites.</p>
         <p>We use third party network advertisers to deliver ads to you on our
         behalf. We may also use third-party service providers to contact you on
         our behalf, or facilitate some aspects of our services or fulfill your
         requests. These network advertisers and service providers may be
         supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable
         information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or
         on our behalf.</p>
         <p>We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in
         special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Terms of Use
         (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property
         rights) or when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or
         appropriate, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of
         our assets in the Ottaway Web Sites. We may also disclose personally
         identifiable information when we, in good faith, believe that the law
         requires us to do so. As we develop our business, we might sell or buy
         businesses or assets. In transactions such as these, customer
         information is generally one of the transferred business assets.
         Moreover, in the unlikely event that we or one of our publishing lines
         are acquired, customer information may be one of the transferred
         assets.</p>
         <p>Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not
         share your personally identifiable information outside of Ottaway
         unless you "opt in" to having your personally identifiable
         information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us.</p>
         <b><u>
         <p>Your Ability to Choose</p>
         </u></b>
         <p>You can always decide not to provide your personal information to
         the Ottaway Web Sites, however in some cases failing to provide such
         information may limit your ability to use certain or features available
         at the Ottaway Web Sites. You can let us know that you do not wish to
         receive information about special offers and new products and features
         by opting out at the time you give us your personally identifiable
         information or after opting in by contacting us at the following e-mail
         address: <a href="mailto:rblack@pressrepublican.com">rblack@pressrepublican.com</a>.</p>
         <b><u>
         </u></b><p><b><u>Cookies</u></b></p>
         <p>We use cookies to allow you to move quickly through our site, to
         recognize repeat visitors and to allow you to take advantage of some of
         our siteâ€™s special features. A cookie is a string of information that
         is sent by a Web site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in
         your computerâ€™s memory. Cookies are small files (just a few hundred
         bytes) and should not pose any significant disk-space concerns. When
         you visit the Ottaway Web Sites, or use some of the features, like
         saving your personalized Ottaway Web Sites settings, we may pass
         cookies to your computer. Some of the cookies that we pass to your
         computer are long term. Otherwise, we would need to ask you for certain
         information with each new session, such as your login information. Some
         cookies do expire after a short period of time.</p>
         <p>Other cookies that you will receive during your sessions here are
         from third-party service providers or third party network advertisers.
         These network advertisers may use their own cookies in order to serve
         ads on the Ottaway Web Sites, ensuring that you will not see the same
         ads over and over again. We are not responsible for the cookies of such
         third parties or any use of your personal information collected by such
         third parties.</p>
         <b><u>
         <p>Ottaway Web Sites Ads</p>
         </u></b>
         <p>When you view an ad for the Ottaway Web Sites on other sites, our
         third party advertising company may place or recognize a unique cookie
         on your browser. The Ottaway Web Sites and the advertising company may
         also use invisible images (often referred to as pixel tags, clear GIFs
         or web beacons) to note which Ottaway Web Sites pages you visit after
         viewing our ads. The information that is collected through the use of
         these images is not personally identifiable and is used only to track
         responses to our advertising efforts.</p>
         <b><u>
         <p>Links to Third Party Web Sites</p>
         </u></b>
         <p>We may make third party content or services from other web sites
         available to you from links located on the Ottaway Web Sites. These
         other web sites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend
         that you review the terms of use and privacy policy at each such web
         site to determine how that site protects your privacy. We are not
         responsible for the content of those web sites or the actions of third
         party web site operators.</p>
         <b><u>
         <p>Security</p>
         </u></b>
         <p>The personally identifiable information we collect about you is
         stored in limited access servers. We will maintain reasonable
         safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally
         identifiable information.</p>
         <b><u>
         <p>Review and Correction</p>
         </u></b>
         <p>You can also request to review, change or delete any of your
         personally identifiable information held by us by contacting us at the
         following e-mail address: <a href="mailto:rblack@pressrepublican.com">rblack@pressrepublican.com</a>.</p>

         Sites including but not limited to, chat services, bulletin boards,
