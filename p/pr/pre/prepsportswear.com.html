                                As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries,
                                or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of
                                the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any
                                pre-existing Privacy Policy. If Prep Sportswear, or substantially all of its assets
                                are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

                                as we believe necessary in connection with an investigation of illegal activity
                                that may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, if you have purchased
                                products from us on extended payment terms, it may be necessary for us to file certain
                                information about you with state or local government offices to perfect our security
                                interest in the products so purchased, or to provide certain information about you
                                to collection agencies in the event of non-payment or a payment dispute.

                                a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly,
                                and our Privacy Policy and the User Agreement will change also. We may e-mail periodic
                                reminders of our policies and agreement, unless you have instructed us not to, but

                                change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information
