			<h1>Prekindle's Privacy Policy</h1>
			
			<div class="legalLine">&nbsp;</div>
			
			<div class="termsParagraph">
			First, you should know that we believe that protecting your privacy is our duty and is one of
			the best ways to gain your respect. We want your respect. We like to be on the right side of things.
			</div>
			
			<h3>What information do you keep about me?</h3>
			<div class="termsParagraph">
			When you purchase tickets through Prekindle, you will supply us with the information required to perform 
			the credit card transaction, deliver your receipt(s), and identifying information that will be used during 
			the will-call process at the event. We will keep this information and it may include your:
			<ul>
				<li>name</li>
				<li>billing address</li>
				<li>phone number</li>
				<li>email address</li>
				<li>what you bought</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			
			<div class="termsParagraph">
			We do not keep your full credit card number on file, we only keep the last four digits in case there is 
			a discrepancy or refund claim at a future time.
			</div>
			
			<h3>Why do you keep this information?</h3>
			<div class="termsParagraph">
			We keep this information in our records so we will be able to support you if any issues arise after your 
			purchase. If you need a receipt re-sent, we can do that quickly and easily. If you are entitled to a refund, 
			we know how much to give you. We only use your information to fulfill our business relationship with you. 
			</div>
			
			<h3>Who, besides Prekindle, will see my information?</h3>
			<div class="termsParagraph">
			The venue hosting the events you attend will have your name on their will call list.
			</div>
			
			<h3>Would you sell my information?</h3>
			<div class="termsParagraph">
			Absolutely not. Our business is helping the live music scene run smoothly and selling tickets to shows. 
			We get paid by doing that successfully. We only use your information to fulfill our business relationship 
			and will not sell this information with any third parties.
			</div>
			
			<h3>What else might you do with my information?</h3>
			<div class="termsParagraph">
			We use non-identifying information about where people are purchasing what to help performers decide where 
			to go. This means your purchase will contribute to our knowledge of the market. ie: there is one more person
			in Town A that is seeking performances by Band B. However, there will not be a name with the number.
			</div>
			
			<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
			<div class="termsParagraph">
			We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we 
			post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the �last updated� date at the top of this Privacy Policy. 
			If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will 
			notify you by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website. We recommend that you check our website 
			from time to time to remain updated as to any changes in our privacy or other policies.
