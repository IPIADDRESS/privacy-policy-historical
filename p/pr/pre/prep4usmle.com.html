<h3>1. OPENING STATEMENTS</h3><br>
<b>1.1 Prep for USMLE</b><br>
This Privacy and Security Policy governs the privacy and security practices of Prep
for USMLE and its website www.prep4usmle.com.<br><br>
<b>1.2 Applicability of Privacy and Security Policy</b><br>
Our Privacy and Security Policy applies to all individuals and entities from whom or
for the benefit of whom we receive personally identifiable information (also
commonly referred to as personally identifying information) (“PII”), whether the PII
be collected through our websites; traditional mailing and/or faxing channels;
telephone or electronic communications; from some other medium; or from our
customers.<br><br>
<b>1.3 Our Commitment to Privacy</b><br>
At Prep for USMLE, we respect the privacy and the confidentiality of our customers’
PII and financial information. We are committed to keeping confidential the PII and
financial information you share with us. We promise to use PII and financial
information only for the purpose for which it has been collected. This Privacy and
Security Policy explains how Prep for USMLE collects, uses, discloses and protects
the information we obtain.<br><br><br><br>

<h3>2. PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW IT IS USED</h3><br>
<b>2.1 Personally Identifiable Information</b> (PII) is any information that would, by itself,
identify you or tend to identify you as a particular individual or entity. This
personally identifiable information may include, but not be limited to, your name,
your address, credit card number, bank account information, and/or personal
identification number (such as a social security number or driver’s license number).<br><br>
<blockquote>
2.1.1 Personally identifiable information does not include any public information that is
readily attainable through federal, state or local public record distribution
channels.<br><br>
2.1.2 Personally identifiable information does not include any information that, by
itself, could not identify you as a particular individual or entity.<br><br>
2.1.3 Personally identifiable information also does not include raw data that becomes
aggregated for statistical purposes and cannot, thereafter, be identified with you as
a unique individual or entity.</blockquote><br>

<b>2.2 Information Collected</b><br><br>
<blockquote>2.2.1 Prep for USMLE collects information that is considered PII and other information
that, by itself, would not be considered personally identifiable information.<br><br>
2.2.2 Typically, Prep for USMLE limits the PII collected about an individual or entity
to the individual’s or entity’s name and electronic mail (“e-mail”) address.</blockquote><br>

<b>2.3 Collecting and Using Personal Information</b><br><br>
<blockquote>2.3.1 Prep for USMLE will explain how it intends to use your personally identifiable
information either before it collects the information (such as in this Privacy and
Security Policy) or contemporaneously with the solicitation of such information
about you. Exceptions may exist where the intended use is obvious to a
reasonable person.<br><br>
2.3.2 We will use the information collected only for the purposes explained to you.
Further, we limit the collection of personally identifiable information to only that
information which is necessary for the purposes explained to you.<br><br>
2.3.3 Unless we are required to do so by law, we shall not obtain your consent before
collecting personal identifying information about you from parties other than Prep
for USMLE. Rather, Prep for USMLE shall presume that you have previously
provided such consent to any such third party from whom Prep for USMLE
obtains such information.<br><br>
2.3.4 Prep for USMLE restricts the use of your PII to Prep for USMLE’s personnel.<br><br>
2.3.5 We shall not sell your PII in the normal course of business operations. Should the
Website be sold, this paragraph shall not restrict the transfer of your PII as part of
the Website sold to a third party.<br><br>
2.3.5. We may use your e-mail or regular mail address to send you communications
about your transactions and our company as well as to notify you of relevant
product news, new products and services, or other information that we believe
may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive electronic
communications unrelated to your transactions with Prep for USMLE, you may
“opt out” of the electronic distributions upon receipt of any such communication.
To discontinue receipt of email communications, you can change preferences in your <a href="http://www.prep4usmle.com/profile.php?action=editprofile">Profile Controls</a>.<br><br>
2.3.6. At the time of registration, Prep for USMLE allows, but does not require, you to
provide additional information such as any “instant messaging” handles, a brief
biography of yourself, or links to your website(s). <i>Please be advised that this
information is visible to other Prep for USMLE consumers</i>.</blockquote><br>

<b>2.4 Disclosing Personal Information</b><br><br>
<blockquote>2.4.1 <u>General</u>. Prep for USMLE may provide your personally identifiable information
to other persons, but only where we have your consent or where we have obtained

provided such consent to any such third party from whom Prep for USMLE
obtains such information) or where we are required or permitted to do so by law.<br><br>
2.4.2 <u>Strategic Partners</u>. Prep for USMLE may employ, engage or retain certain trusted
third parties (“Strategic Partners”) to perform functions and/or provide services on
its behalf. Prep for USMLE will share PII with these strategic partners only to the
extent necessary to perform the functions and/or provide the services for which
they have been employed, engaged or retained. Prep for USMLE shall also
secure contractual obligations from our strategic partners to maintain the privacy
and security of the PII shared with them.<br><br>
2.4.3 <u>Business Transfers</u>. Prep for USMLE reserves the right to sell, transfer or
otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your PII, in connection with a

You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the planned
processing of your information by the purchaser differs materially from that set
forth in this Privacy and Security Policy.<br><br>
2.4.4 <u>Legal Compliance</u>. Prep for USMLE may disclose any information about you to
government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole
discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims or legal process
(including subpoenas); to protect the property and rights of Prep for USMLE, its
strategic partners or other third parties; to protect the safety of the public or any
person; to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity; or,
generally, to comply with the law.</blockquote><br>

<b>2.5 Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b><br><br>

described, Prep for USMLE also collects other non-personally identifiable
information (“non-PII”).<br><br>
2.5.2 Non-PII collected by Prep for USMLE may be utilized without restriction.<br><br>
2.5.3 Although non-PII can be used in a number of ways, you can be assured that the
use of the non-PII cannot identify you as an individual or entity.<br> <br> 
2.5.4 Because non-PII cannot be used to identify you, Prep for USMLE may in its
discretion provide non-PII to other persons.</blockquote><br>
