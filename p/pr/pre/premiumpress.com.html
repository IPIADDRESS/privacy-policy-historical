              that we take every precaution necessary to ensure privacy of your 
              personal information. This notice describes our privacy policy. 
              By visiting Premium Press, you are accepting the practices described 
              in this Privacy Notice.</p>
            <p><span class="headlines">What Personal Information About Customers 
              Does Premium Press Gather?</span></p>
            <p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and 
              continually improve your shopping experience at Premium Press. Here 
              are the types of information we gather.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Information You Give Us</strong>: We receive and store 
                any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other 
                way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then 
                you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features 
                and special offers. We use the information that you provide in 
                order to respond to your requests, customizing future shopping, 
                improving our stores, and communicating with you.</li>
              <li><strong>Automatic Information</strong>: We receive and store 
                certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For 
                example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and 
                we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses 
                Premium Press. A number of companies offer utilities designed 
                to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not 
                be able to provide you with a personalized experience at Premium 
                Press if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that 
                these tools exist.</li>
              <li><strong>E-mail Communications</strong>: To help us make e-mails 
                more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when 
                you open e-mail from Premium Press if your computer supports such 
                capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received 
                from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary 
                messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail 
                or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication 
                Preferences.</li>
              <li><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong>: We might receive 
                information about you from other sources and add it to our account 
                information. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="headlines">What About Cookies? </p>
            <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's 
              hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize 
              your browser and to provide features such as 1-Click purchasing, 
              New for You, personalized Amazon Honor System greetings, and storage 
              of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. <br>
              The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how 
              to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have 
              the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to 
              disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full 
              advantage of some of Premium Press's coolest features, and we recommend 
              that you leave them turned on. </p>
            <p class="headlines">Does Premium Press Share the Information It Receives?</p>
            <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, 
              and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share 
              customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries 
              Premium Press, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy 
              Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described 
              in this Privacy Notice. </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control</strong>: We 
                work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, such 
                as Marketplace, zShops, and Auctions sellers, these businesses 
                operate stores at Premium Press or sell offerings to you at Premium 
                Press. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or 
                sell product lines jointly with these businesses. Click here for 
                some examples of co-branded and joint offerings. You can tell 
                when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share 
                customer information related to those transactions with that third 
                party.</li>
              &gt; 
              <li><strong>Agents</strong>: We employ other companies and individuals 
                to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling 
                orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing 
                repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing 
                marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including 
                paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and 
                providing customer service. They have access to personal information 
                needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other 
                purposes.</li>
              <li><strong>Promotional Offers</strong>: Sometimes we send offers 
                to selected groups of Premium Press customers on behalf of other 
                businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your 
                name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please 
                adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.</li>
              <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: As we continue to develop 
                our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business 
                units. In such transactions, customer information generally is 
                one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to 
                the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, 
                of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely 
                event that Premium Press, Inc., or substantially all of its assets 
                are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the 
                transferred assets.</li>
              <li><strong>Protection of Premium Press and Others</strong>: We 
                release account and other personal information when we believe 
                release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply 
                our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, 
                property, or safety of Premium Press, our users, or others. This 
                includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations 
                for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, 
                this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise 
                disclosing personally identifiable information from customers 
                for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth 
                in this Privacy Notice.</li>
              <li><strong>With Your Consent</strong>: Other than as set out above, 
                you will receive notice when information about you might go to 
                third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not 
                to share the information. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="headlines">How Secure Is Information About Me? </p>
            <ul>
              <li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission 
                by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information 
                you input.</li>
              <li>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers 
                when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit 
                card number to the appropriate credit card company during order 
                processing.</li>
              <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access 
                to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when 
                finished using a shared computer. Click here for more information

            </ul>
            <p class="headlines">Which Information Can I Access?</p>
            <p>Premium Press gives you access to a broad range of information 
              about your account and your interactions with Premium Press for 
              the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that 
              information. Click here to see some examples, the list of which 
              will change as our Web site evolves. </p>
            <p class="headlines">What Choices Do I Have? </p>
            <ul>
              <li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, 
                even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage 
                of such Premium Press features as Your About You Area, Wish Lists, 
                and Customer Reviews.</li>
                <li>You can add or update certain information on pages such as those 
                listed in the "Which Information Can I Access?" section 
                above. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of 
                the prior version for our records. </li>
                <li>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please 
                adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. (If you do not 
                want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from 
                us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern 
                your use of Premium Press, and it is your responsibility to review 
                them for changes.)</li>
                <li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you 
                how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to 
                have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or 
                how to disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able 
                to use such important features as 1-Click ordering and New for 
                You if you do not use cookies.</li>

            <p class="headlines">Children</p>
            <p>Premium Press does not sell products for purchase by children. 
              We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 
              18, you may use Premium Press only with the involvement of a parent 
              or guardian. </p>
            <p class="headlines">Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions </p>
            <p>If you choose to visit Premium Press, your visit and any dispute 
              over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, 
              including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application 
              of the law of the state of California. If you have any concern about 
              privacy at Premium Press, please send us a thorough description 
              to <a href="mailto:feedback@PremiumPress.com">feedback@PremiumPress.com</a>, 
              and we will try to resolve it. </p>
            <p>Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the 
              Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders 
              of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not 
              to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. 
              Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all 
              information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind 
              the promises we make, however, and will never materially change 
              our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer 
              information collected in the past without the consent of affected 
              customers.<br>

              Premium Press is committed to customer satisfaction. We will reprint 
              or refund the cost of any product that fails to meet our customer’s 
              quality expectations. However, we cannot take responsibility for 
              typing, image, or design errors introduced by customers in the document 
              creation process. In an effort to keep costs down and pass those 
              savings along to our customers, Premium Press does not review card 
              documents for content or spelling.</p>
            <p>Premium Press guarantees that you will be satisfied with the quality 
              of our products. If you are not satisfied with any product, please
