    <p>
      We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) from

      habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your

    We may use “cookies” and web beacons to help us manage this Website.
    Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric

    <h2>Privacy Practices for our Technology</h2>

    <h5>Overview of our Technology </h5>

    <p>
      Our Technology collects information about the website(s) that you visit
      and the advertisements that you see while online. You may encounter our
      Technology: when we purchase online advertisements on a website that you
      visit; when one of our Clients purchases online advertisements on a
      website that you visit; and/or when one of our Clients places one of our
      web beacons on its website, which you visit. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We use the information collected by our Technology in order to help make
      the online advertisements you see more relevant to you, and for ad
      delivery and reporting purposes. 
    </p>

    <h3>Types of information we collect via our Technology </h3>

    <h5>Personally Identifiable Information</h5>

    <p>
      We don't collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) via our
      Technology.
    </p>

    <h5>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h5>

    <p>We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) via our
    Technology, including but not limited to your IP host address, pages viewed,
    browser type, the URL, the referring URL, Internet Service Provider, and your
    computer's operating system. </p>

    <h5>Cookies and Web beacons</h5>

    <p>Our Technology uses cookies in conjunction with Web beacons in order to help
    make the online advertisements you see more relevant to you. We also use
    cookies and web beacons to measure the success of our online advertising
    campaigns, and the campaigns of our Clients. </p>

    <h2>Controlling the use of your information </h2>

    <h5>Opting out from Cookies</h5>

    <p>
      If you'd like to opt-out from having Snap collect your Non-PII in
      connection with our Technology, please see our 
      <a href="opt_out">opt-out page</a>
      located at <a href="opt_out">http://www.snap.com/about/opt_out</a>.
      we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie
      tells us not to collect your Non-PII to tailor online advertisement
      campaigns.  Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict
      cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may
      need to renew your opt-out choice.
    </p>

    <h5>Deleting your PII</h5>

    <p>
      Although we don't collect PII via our Technology, if you'd like us to
      delete any PII that you have provided to us on this Website, please send
      your request to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@snap.com">privacy@snap.com</a> and we will process
      your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties </h2>

    <p>
      We do not collect PII via our Technology, and we do not sell, rent or
      share PII collected on the Website with non-affiliated third parties
      without your consent. We may, however, share your PII with trusted third
      party contractors who provide services for us. These third party
      contractors are prohibited from using the information we provide for
      purposes other than performing services for us. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We may share Non-PII collected via our Technology with Clients.
      Similarly, we may enhance the Non-PII collected via our Technology with
      Non-PII collected from Clients. This information cannot be used to
      contact or identify any person individually. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably
      believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate,
      prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited
      activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving
      potential threats to the physical safety of any person. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, we may transfer information any information we have to a
      successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation,
      sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. 
    </p>

    <h2>Storage of Information and Security</h2>

    <p>
      We retain PII collected via the Website for a reasonable time for record
      keeping purposes. The information that we store is usually deleted as
      space requires or in the normal course of business.  We don't collect PII
      via the Technology. We retain the Non-PII collected via the Technology
      for up to 24 months, after which time the information is only stored in
      aggregate form.
    </p>

    <p>
      The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented
      reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both
      during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not
      limited to the use of encryption. No method of transmission over the
      Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
      Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
      protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have any questions about our security practices, please send an
      email to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@snap.com">privacy@snap.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy </h2>

    <p>
      This privacy policy is subject to change. If we make any material or
      substantive changes in the way that we use the PII collected through this
      Website, we will post a clear and conspicuous notice of those changes on
      the Website and in this privacy policy. 
    </p>

    <h5>General</h5>

    <p>
