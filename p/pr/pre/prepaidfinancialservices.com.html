  <h2>Introduction </h2>
  <p>Welcome to <a href="http://www.prepaidfinancialservices.com">

	We take your privacy seriously and this Privacy Policy explains the steps we 
	take to ensure information about you is kept secure and confidential.</p>
 
  <h2>The information we collect from you</h2>
  <p>We will collect personal information about you which you provide to us when 
	using the Site, for example, when you activate your PFS Prepaid Card, log in 
	to manage your PFS Prepaid Card, contact us through the Site, request 
	information or otherwise provide personal information to us. Such 
	information may include (but is not limited to) your PFS Pre Paid Card card 
	number and PIN, your full name, address, telephone number and email address. 
	You must ensure that the personal information you provide to us is accurate 
	and complete. <br>
  </p>
  <h2>Purposes for which we use your personal information</h2>
  <p>We collect, use, store and otherwise process personal information about you 
	for the following purposes: (i) to enable you to access and use the Site; 
	and (ii) to run your PFS Pre Paid Card account; and (iii) to process your 
	fund transfers and transactions; and (iv) to enable us to provide any 
	services which you have requested through use of the Site; and (v) to 
	personalise aspects of our overall service to you; and (vi) to provide you 
	with information regarding products and services that we feel may be of 
	interest to you (see the "Marketing" section below). <br>
  </p>
  <h2>Disclosing information about you</h2>
  <p>We will not disclose personal information obtained from you to any third 
	parties other than in connection with legal proceedings or potential legal 
	proceedings or if otherwise required to do so by law or any other 
	Governmental or law enforcement agency (including but not limited to PFS, 
	Newcastle Building Society our card issuer or Symmetrex, our card

	you to enable us to provide you with information by email, telephone or post 
	regarding products and services that we feel may be of interest to you if 
	you have provided your consent for us to do so by ticking the relevant box(es) 
	on this website where your personal information is collected. <br>
	<br>
	If you wish to withdraw consent to use this information at any time for 
	either us and/or our partners', then you should <a href="contact.aspx">
	contact</a> the Information Officer at PFS.<br>
	<br>
	We may need to disclose your personal information if you breach this Privacy 
	Policy and/or our <a href="terms.aspx">Terms of Use</a> or in connection

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Keeping your personal information secure is very important to us. We will 
	take appropriate and up-to-date measures to protect your personal 
	information. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be 
	guaranteed to be totally secure. As a result, whilst we strive to protect 
	your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any 
	information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk. <br>
  </p>
  <h2>Transferring your information abroad</h2>
  <p>We may store, process and/or transfer the personal information you submit 
	to us through use of the Site to countries outside of the European Economic 
	Area including (without limitation) to the USA. Personal data transferred 
	outside of the EEA will be stored and processed by our group companies or 
	representative offices for business and management purposes, to perform a 
	contractual obligation owed by us to you and/or to provide you with 
	information or services that you have requested. By using this Site, you 
	consent to us transferring your personal information to countries outside 
	the EEA for our legitimate business purposes as outlined in this paragraph. 
	We will take appropriate steps to protect your personal data.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>Cookies are small files on your computer, which can store information that 
	you transmit when accessing the internet. They are transmitted via the web 
	browser to the computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot transmit any 
	information from a computer system. They instead help to make a return visit 
	to the Site as simple and user friendly as possible. Some cookies remain on 
	the computer's hard drive so that Partner recognises your computer on your 
	next visit. You can change your browser options at any time to deactivate 
	cookies. (Some functions are only accessible when cookies are enabled and we 
	therefore recommend allowing cookies.) <br>

	not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy 
	policy applies solely to information collected by this Site.&nbsp; <br>

  <h2>Data Protection Registration</h2>
  <p>Partner has notified the UK Information Commissioner's Office that it 
	processes personal data and appears on the register of data controllers.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
  </p>
  <h2>Privacy related questions or complaints</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions relating to this Privacy Policy or how we use 
	your personal information, or if you believe that we have not complied with 
	this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information, you may write
