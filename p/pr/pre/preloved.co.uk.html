	&gt; Preloved Privacy Policy
</div>
<h1>Preloved Privacy Policy</h1>


<p class="spaced">We take your privacy very seriously and are keen to ensure that you do not receive any unwelcome messages or spam as a result of your joining Preloved.</p> 
<p class="spaced">Most importantly:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We do not publish your email address on the web site</li>
	<li>You have complete control over any emails that Preloved sends you</li>
	<li>We do not share your details with any other company for marketing purposes</li>
</ul>
<p class="spaced">The policy below explains in detail how we manage your personal information:</p>

<div class="dotted"><hr></div>

<h2>How we collect personal information</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You may browse the site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.</li>
	<li>In order to perform certain activities on Preloved, you must first become a member. During registration, you are required to supply your name, a screen name (which can be just a first name or a nickname), contact information (email address and or telephone number), and your approximate geographic location.</li> 
	<li>You may also choose to provide additional personal information (for example your occupation and your hobbies) in your Public Profile. This is entirely optional and it is down to you to decide how much information you wish to make public and in what detail.</li>
	<li>If you make a credit card payment to Preloved, you do so via a third party payment processing company. In this case, Preloved may store your full address and the results of any card verification checks. Preloved does not store credit card numbers.</li>
</ul>

<div class="dotted"><hr></div>

<h2>Disclosing your personal information</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Preloved may publish a member's screen name, town, county and country on the site. Other details of the address (including the postcode) are not published on the site.</li>
	<li>When becoming a member of Preloved, you are given the opportunity to specify whether you wish to be contacted via email or telephone in response to any adverts you publish. You must choose at least one of these methods of contact. If you choose to be contacted by telephone, your telephone number is published to other members. If you choose to be contacted by email, your email address is not published but we provide a form from which other members can send you a message. These settings can be changed by visiting the members area at <a href="http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/">http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/</a></li>
	<li>Preloved may publish a member's Public Profile on the site. You can control the information contained in this profile at <a href="http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/">http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/</a></li>
	<li>Preloved will not sell, share or rent your name, email address, or any other personal details to any other third party for marketing purposes.</li>
	<li>Preloved may at its discretion disclose personal information that is required by the police (or other organisations with a law enforcement role) for the prevention and detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, as provided for under Section 29 of the Data Protection Act.</li>
	<li>Preloved may at its discretion disclose personal information to intellectual property rights holders for the investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement or other unlawful activity connected to their property, as provided for under Section 35 of the Data Protection Act.</li>
	<li>Preloved may disclose specific personal information where it is required to by law, and where necessary for the purpose of or in connection with any legal proceedings, as provided for under Section 35 of the Data Protection Act.</li>
	<li>We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners, advertisers or other third parties. This will not contain information that can identify any individual person.</li>
</ul>

<div class="dotted"><hr></div>

<h2>Newsletters and other email</h2>
<ul>
	<li>We send all new members a welcome message via email. We also send members emails relating to the status of their account (for example when an advert needs to be renewed or their membership is about to expire).</li>
	<li>At the time of joining, members are offered the opportunity to receive an email newsletter. This newsletter is published from time to time and contains news about the site, hints and tips, special offers, and other information that we feel would be of interest to our members. Members may at any time choose to no longer receive this information by visiting the members area at <a href="http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/">http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/</a>, or by following the instructions contained in each email they receive.</li>
	<li>Members may choose to subscribe to certain areas of the site to receive new content via email (for example to receive new adverts in a certain category). Members may at any time choose to no longer receive this information by visiting the members area at <a href="http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/">http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/</a>, or by following the instructions contained in each email they receive.</li>
</ul>

<div class="dotted"><hr></div>

<h2>Tell a friend</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In some areas of the web site, Preloved offers tools to allow users to send information to a friend. Preloved will send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Preloved does not store any information about the sender, the recipient, nor details of the message sent.</li>
</ul>

<div class="dotted"><hr></div>

<h2>Viewing or changing your personal information</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Members may view all information that Preloved stores about them as an individual, by visiting the members area at <a href="http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/">http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/</a></li>
	<li>Here, they may also correct or update their personal information and opt out of receiving future newsletters or subscriptions by email. (see 'Newsletters and other email' above).</li>
</ul>

<div class="dotted"><hr></div>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A cookie is a small piece of text placed by us on the user's computer. They enable us to recognise visitors as they move from page to page. They enable us to personalise the visitor experience and to avoid the need to repeatedly log in. Cookies set by Preloved do not contain any personal information about you.</li>
