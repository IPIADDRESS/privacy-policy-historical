	</ul>

	<h2>IP Addresses</h2>
	<p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>


	<h2>Cookies</h2>
	<p>For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Some of the cookies we use are essential for the site to operate.	</p>

	<p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Recognise you as you move from one page to the next during a browsing session. This enables us, for example, to remember that you placed a particular item into a shopping basket.</li>
		<li>Recognise that you are logged in.</li>
		<li>Store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site and to provide you with offers that are targeted at your individual interests.</li>
		<li>Recognise you when you return to our site at a later date.</li>
		<li>Estimate our audience size and analyse general usage patterns.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control. </p>
	<p>You block cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be to access all or parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon you visit our site.</p>


	<h2>Where We Store Your Personal Data</h2>
	<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
	<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
