<p class="spaced">The policy below discloses full details of how we manage your personal information:
</p><p class="spaced"><b>How we collect personal information</b>
<br>In order to perform certain activities on Preloved, a user must first become a member. During registration, the user is required to supply their name, contact information, and their approximate geographic location. This information allows other visitors to respond to any adverts placed by the member.
</p><p class="spaced">The member may also choose to provide more information such as a complete address, demographic information, or other comments. This is not compulsory but encouraged, in order to provide us with a better understanding of how to improve the service to our members.
</p><p class="spaced"><b>Disclosing your personal information</b>
<br>When joining Preloved, members are given the opportunity to specify whether to reveal their email address or telephone number to other Preloved members. The member must choose at least one of these methods of contact. These settings can be changed by visiting the members area at <a href="http://members.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-members.default/b7edd084.html">http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/</a> Members may also choose to disclose other personal information to Preloved members by adding this information in the members area.
</p><p class="spaced"><b>Sharing Information</b>
<br>Preloved Classifieds will not sell, share or rent your name, email address, or any other personal details to others.
</p><p class="spaced">We may however, as provided for under Exemption 29 of the Data Protection Act, disclose specific information that is required by the police for the prevention and detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders.</p>
<p class="spaced">We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
</p><p class="spaced"><b>Newsletters and other email</b>
<br>We send all new members a welcome message via email. We also send members conformation of new adverts placed by them, and advise when they are about to expire.
</p><p class="spaced">At the time of joining, members are offered the opportunity to opt in to receiving an email newsletter. This newsletter is published from time to time and containing news about the site, hints and tips, special offers, and other information that we feel would be of interest to our members. Members may at any time choose to no longer receive this information by visiting the members area at <a href="http://members.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-members.default/b7edd084.html">http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/</a>, or by following the instructions contained in each email they receive.
</p><p class="spaced">Members may choose to receive information of new adverts published to the site in their chosen category via email using our Ad Alert system. They may also choose to follow discussions in the Preloved forums via email. Members may opt to no longer receive this information at any time by visiting the members area at <a href="http://members.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-members.default/b7edd084.html">http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/</a>, or by following the instructions contained in each email they receive.
</p><p class="spaced"><b>Tell a friend</b>
<br>In some areas of the web site, Preloved offers tools to allow users to send information to a friend. Preloved will send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Preloved Classifieds does not store any information about the sender, the recipient, nor details of the message sent.
</p><p class="spaced"><b>Protecting your email address</b>
<br>We forbid other individuals or organisations from taking email addresses from this site and using them for reasons other than in direct connection with a member's request for contact (for example in response to an advert).
</p><p class="spaced">We actively protect members' email addresses from those programs that scan web sites, siphoning out email addresses for spam use. This is done to the best of our ability and current knowledge but without risking denial of access from our legitimate users.
</p><p class="spaced">If you believe a company or individual has obtained your email address from Preloved Classifieds and is not responding to a request for contact, please contact us at <a href="http://www.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-contact.default/2e4fb1e5.html">http://www.preloved.co.uk/contact/</a>, providing as much information as possible. We will take whatever action we feel is appropriate and within our power.
</p><p class="spaced"><b>Viewing or changing your personal information</b>
<br>Members may view all information that Preloved Classifieds stores about them as an individual, by visiting our members' area at <a href="http://members.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-members.default/b7edd084.html">http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/</a>
</p><p class="spaced">Here, they may also correct their personal information and unsubscribe from future newsletters (see 'Newsletters and other email' above).
</p><p class="spaced"><b>Cookies</b>
<br>A cookie is a small piece of data placed by us on the user's computer. All cookies sent by Preloved are restricted to sequential numbers and randomly generated letters. These enable us to identify users as they visit different pages on the site, in order that we can personalise the visitor experience and to avoid the need to repeatedly log in. A cookie also enables us to recognise and greet visitors on their next visit to Preloved.
</p><p class="spaced">Some of our business partners use cookies (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
</p><p class="spaced">It may well be possible to use most of the features within Preloved without cookies although this is not guaranteed nor recommended.
</p><p class="spaced"><b>Links to Other Sites</b>
<br>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Preloved Classifieds are not responsible for the privacy practices of other such sites.
