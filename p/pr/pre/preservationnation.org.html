</p><p><strong>Personal Information Collected</strong>
</p><p>The National Trust has a strong commitment to internet privacy. We provide choices to the consumer in deciding when and how to provide different categories of "personally identifiable information" (e.g., data that may be used to identify, contact or locate a person such as name, physical address, e-mail address and phone number and information you provide to help customize your web experience). In general, when you visit our Websites and access information, we do not require you to register or provide personal identifiable information to us. However, there are occasions when we will ask for additional information. For example, you may be required to register your name and e-mail address or other necessary information in order to enter certain member-only areas of the Websites such as for Forum and Partners. You may also be required to register your name and e-mail address and provide other information if you wish to receive e-newsletters, event information, participate in special initiatives or in surveys or contests. It is your choice to provide such information, and you may opt-out from receiving any of this type of information in the future.
</p><p>Personally identifiable information, such as your name, physical address, e-mail address, phone number and credit card information will be collected if you wish to become a member of the National Trust online, make purchases online, receive e-newsletters, or make online donations.

</p><p><strong>Internet Protocol and Cookies</strong>
</p><p>We may keep track of your interactions with our Websites and our services to offer a more personalized experience through your Internet Protocol address or through the use of “Cookies” and web analytics services.<br> <br> An Internet Protocol (IP) address is associated with the portal through which you enter the internet, like your internet service provider (ISP). Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our visitors visit various parts of our Websites. We may also combine this information with personally identifiable information, e.g., your name and address that you have provided to us and/or with other information that is publicly available or that we receive from other reputable sources in order to make our Websites and communications more targeted to your interests.
</p><p>"Cookies" are small files sent from a web server to your computer through your browser program that permit the computer to help customize your experience with our Websites. The National Trust uses cookies to measure visitation to the National Trust’s Websites, including repeat visitors and to perform certain functions such as order processing, registrations, and advertising. Cookies may be used to store some history about the parts of our Websites that you have visited to help you navigate our Websites more easily or to alert you to related pages on our Websites that may interest you. The National Trust does not use cookies to obtain information about other Websites that you may have visited. The National Trust may also use web analytics services and conversion tracking, which use cookies and other means to collect and analyze data.

The National Trust will automatically send the recipient a one-time message inviting them to visit a website. The National Trust uses the recipient's information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail, and the recipient information is not retained.

</p><p>If you provide your personal identifiable information on a public forum (e.g. a blog) the National Trust is not responsible for monitoring these transmissions and cannot be responsible for any personally identifiable information contained in such transmissions. Please review the National Trust’s <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> for more information. If you wish to be removed from one of our e-mail lists or from receiving information from the National Trust, you may opt-out at any time.
</p><p><strong>Use of Membership Information</strong>
</p><p>On a selective basis, members of the National Trust may be selected to receive information via postal mail from other non-profit organizations, including state and local preservation organizations and occasionally for-profit organizations that we think may be of interest to you. You have the right to opt-out of these mailings. <br> <strong><br> Links to Third Party Websites</strong>
</p><p>We provide many links to third party websites existing outside of the National Trust. Since we do not control the content or functionality of these websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on those third party websites. Any link from www.preservationnation.org, <a href="https://savingplaces.org">www.savingplaces.org</a> or another National Trust website to a third party website does not denote an affiliation with the website or an endorsement of its viewpoint(s) or mission(s). Please review the National Trust’s <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> for more information.
</p><p><strong>Subsidiaries, Affiliates and National Trust Historic Sites </strong>

We may share your personal identifiable information with the National Trust’s subsidiaries, affiliates and historic sites to inform you of the various product and service offerings in which you might be interested unless you opt-out of receiving such information. Most of the subsidiaries, affiliates and historic sites owned and operated by the National Trust are subject to the same opt-out rights that apply to use of personally identifiable information by the National Trust.

If, at a later date, you decide to opt-out of receiving information from those entities, you will need to contact them directly.
</p><p><strong>Co-Branded Partners</strong>
</p><p>From time to time, the National Trust may offer certain promotions, programs or activities on our Websites or on websites hosted or managed by the National Trust that are co-sponsored or co-branded by non-profit and/or for-profit partners, such as purchasing products or services offered by our partners, or electing to participate in advocacy campaigns, contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in part by our partners, which will be subject to their own terms of use. At the time of engagement, you will be offered an opportunity to choose to authorize the National Trust to share your information with our partners so you may receive information from the partners. We do not control the privacy practices or terms of use of our co-branded partners; therefore, you should review their privacy practices before you choose to access their products or services. You are entitled to <a href="#questions">opt-out</a> from receiving any resulting information from the National Trust as set forth in this Privacy Policy at any time. However, if at a later date, you decide to opt-out of receiving information from our partners, you will need to contact the partners directly.
</p><p><strong>Licensees</strong>
</p><p>We may share your personally identifiable information (e.g. name and address) with third parties that offer products or services under or in association with brand names of the National Trust. A licensee is one whose products or services are offered to you with our name. These licensees are restricted by contract to use your information solely for purposes of marketing or promotional materials related to National Trust products or services. You are entitled to opt-out from receiving this information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you choose to access purchases through one of our licensees, they may in some cases collect your personal identifiable information subject to their own privacy policies. We do not control the privacy practices of our licensees; therefore, you should review their privacy practices before you choose to access their products or services, and you will need to contact the licensees directly to opt-out of receiving information from them.
</p><p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong>
</p><p>We use third party advertising companies to service ads when you visit our Websites. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to the Websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p><p><strong>Other Disclosures</strong>
</p><p>The National Trust will share personal identifiable information with third parties if we have a good-faith belief that disclosing the information is reasonably necessary to:
</p><ul>
	<li>Meet applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request;</li>
	<li>Enforce the National Trust’s <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>;</li>

</ul><p><a href="#top">back to top</a>
</p><p> <a name="security"></a>
</p><h3>SECURITY OF YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION</h3><p>All information provided to the National Trust is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on secure portions of our Websites that are only accessible by certain qualified employees of the National Trust. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. <br> <br> If you do not wish to use our online payment services, payments and donations may be made by contacting our 24-hour call center at 1-800-315-NTHP (6847).
</p><p>Some of the National Trust Stewardship Historic Sites’ websites include links to online stores or for ticket sales that are operated by third party companies. You should review the credit card security information and the privacy policies of those third party companies before making a purchase.

</p><h3>COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAWS</h3><p><strong>Children's Privacy Policy</strong>
</p><p>None of the Websites covered by this Privacy Policy knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under the age of 13. The Websites are not directed to, nor do they have knowledge of, visitors less than 13 years of age. We are committed to protecting children's privacy, and we will monitor our Websites and their users to make sure that their privacy is protected. If we discover that a person under the age of 13 has provided us with any personal identifiable information, we will delete that information from our systems. We are unable to reply to information requests from children under the age of 13, if so identified. A parent or guardian must initiate the requests from children under the age of 13 on their behalf. If we begin marketing to children on-line and we are aware that those children are under the age of 13, the National Trust will take steps to fully comply with the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). To learn more about both of these programs, see www.coppa.org.
</p><p><strong>Spam</strong>
</p><p>The National Trust complies fully with the Controlling the Assault on Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act). To this end, the National Trust:<br> ALWAYS provides recipients of e-mail marketing and e-newsletters a clear mechanism to opt-out of receiving information in the future and honors any such requests promptly.<br> ALWAYS provides accurate header and subject line information prior to sending any e-mails. The National Trust commits to sending only e-mails with specific subject lines and a clear delineation from whom the e-mail was sent.<br> ALWAYS provides the National Trust's physical address within the body of all of our e-mail messages.
