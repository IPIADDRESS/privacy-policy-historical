            		<h1>Prezi Privacy Policy</h1>
					<p>

					Thank you for visiting Prezi's ("Prezi") Internet web site located at the URL www.Prezi.com ("Site"). This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout Prezi governing Prezi's use of personally identifiable information about users of our Site and users of our services and/or software that is available for download on this Site.
					</p>
					<h2>
					Privacy Policy Updates.
					</h2>
					<p>
					Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Prezi may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Prezi will post our updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at http://www.Prezi.com/legal/privacy_policy.html so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information. Prezi will also send registered users of the Site e-mail notifications notifying such users of any changes to the Privacy Policy. Prezi encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this Site and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.
					</p>
					<h2>
					Information Collection and Use.
					</h2>
					<p>
					You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain sections of this Site and when you download any software we may offer, we may invite you to contact us with questions or comments or request information or complete a profile or registration form. Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may collect personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address, password, organization and other contact information that you voluntarily transmit with your communication to us. We also may collect information about you and your use of our Site, services and/or software through your use of our Site, services and/or software. When you register for an account, we will collect your first and last name, e-mail address, password and organization name and use this information to create a user account where you can create, manage, access and share presentations and other information that you post to the Site with other users of the Site that you designate.
					</p>
					<p>
					We may use your personally identifiable information to register you to use our services or download client software, contact you to deliver certain services or information you have requested, verify your authority to enter our Site, improve the content and general administration of the Site and our services and provide you with notices regarding our services.
					</p>
					<h2>
					Shared Distribution List.
					</h2>
					<p>
					Through your user account, you can create a shared distribution list and designate the e-mail addresses of other users with whom you wish to provide access to your presentations and other information that you post on the Site.

					<h2>

					<h2>
					Disclosure.
					</h2>
					<p>
					We may provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our services to you. For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to a credit card processing company to process your payment. We will also disclose your personally identifiable information (a) only if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation of a governmental authority, (b) to enforce the Prezi Terms of Use agreement or to protect our rights or (c) to protect the safety of users of our Site and our services. We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization except we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Prezi participates or to a purchaser or acquirer of all or substantially all of Prezi's assets to which this Site relates.
