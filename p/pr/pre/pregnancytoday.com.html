    Policy is posted and does not apply to any other information collected 
    by The Walt Disney Family of Companies through any other means. <br>
     <br>
    As used in this Privacy Policy, "The Walt Disney Family of Companies" 
    refers to The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiary and affiliated 
    entities, singly or together, including companies such as ABC and ESPN 
    that generally do not offer their products and services under the "Disney" 
    brand name, as well as companies that generally do offer their products 
    and services under the "Disney" brand name.  (At times, our 
    Web site refers to The Walt Disney Family of Companies as "The 
    Walt Disney family of companies.")  The Walt Disney Internet Group 
    (including its subsidiaries) is a member of The Walt Disney Family of 
    Companies, and is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "WDIG," 
    "we," "us," "our," and "ourselves."  <br>

     <br>
    In keeping with the traditions of The Walt Disney Company, we refer 
    to individuals who purchase or use products or services of The Walt 
    Disney Family of Companies as "guests."  When this Privacy 
    Policy uses the term "personally identifiable information," 
    we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as 
    the individual's name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone 
    number.  When other information (such as, for example, consumer product 
    preferences or number of children) is directly associated with personally 
    identifiable information, this other information also is treated as 
    personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.  
    Personally identifiable information does not include screen names (also 
    known as member names, usernames or other online aliases) provided by 
    our guests in the course of registering with or using our Web site, 
    except in circumstances in which we request that guests provide their 
    e-mail addresses as their screen names.  Personally identifiable information 
    is sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as "personal information."  
    Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable 
    laws.</font>

     <br>
     <br>
    Much of the personally identifiable information we receive comes directly 
    from guests who are interested in obtaining various products and services 
    from us or another member of The Walt Disney Family of Companies.  Typically, 
    this information includes the guest's name, postal address, e-mail 
    address, and telephone number.  We may also collect other types of information 
    such as gender, age, number of children, and personal interests, which 
    we may associate with personally identifiable information.  If you purchase 
    products or services from us or another member of The Walt Disney Family 
    of Companies, we'll note, for example, credit card information, the 
    type of services or products ordered or purchased, and the date of the 
    order or purchase.  You may also provide us photographs or other video 
    materials, which may contain personal information.  We may collect personal 
    information when you register on, log on, or visit our Web site, including 
    when you participate in activities on our Web site, such as sweepstakes, 
    contests, games, and informational and promotional offers, and when 
    you provide information to our customer service representatives</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana">  
    Finally, our Web site may offer message boards, conversation pages, 
    chat rooms, social community environments, profile pages, and other 
    Public Forums (as defined in the Terms of Use governing our Web site 
    (the "Terms of Use")), as well as other features in which you may 
    provide us with User Submissions (as defined in the Terms of Use).  
    If you provide personal information when you use any of these features, 
    that personal information may be publicly posted and otherwise disclosed 
    without limitation as to its use by a third party.  Our rules regarding 
    User Submissions are described in the Terms of Use, including in the 
    "User Submissions," "Public Forums and Communication" and "House 
    Rules" sections of the Terms of Use. <br>
     <br>
    <u>Information Collected Through Technology </u>

     <br>
     <br>
    We collect information through technology to make our site more interesting 
    and useful to you and for various purposes related to our business.  
    For instance, when you come to our site, we collect your IP address.  
    An IP address is associated with the access point through which you 
    enter the Internet, and is typically controlled by your Internet Service 
    Provider (ISP), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your 
    IP address is not personally identifiable.  We may use IP addresses 
    to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests 
    visit various parts of our site, and we may combine IP addresses with 
    personally identifiable information. <br>
     <br>
    Our Web site collects information through a variety of technical methods, 
    including cookies and Web beacons.  Cookies are pieces of information 
    that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web 
    site.  Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images 
    on the pages of Web sites.  Cookies, web beacons and other technical 
    methods may involve the transmission of information either directly 
    to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on 
    our behalf.</font> <br>
    <p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana">We may use the information 
    collected through these technical methods for many purposes, including 
    delivering content, tracking and enhancing our guests' experience 
    on our Web site.  For example, when you return to our Web site 
    after logging in, cookies provide information to the site so that the 
    site will remember who you are.  We also may use technical methods to 
    analyze the traffic patterns on our Web site, such as the frequency 
    with which our users visit various parts of our Web site, and third 
    party Web sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit other 
    Web sites.  In HTML e-mails that we send our guests, we may use technical 
    methods for a number of purposes, including: to determine whether our 
    guests have opened or forwarded those e-mails and/or clicked on links 
    in those e-mails, to customize the display of banner advertisements 
    and other messages after a guest has closed the e-mail, and to determine 
    whether a guest has made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular 
    e-mail.  These technical methods may enable us to collect and use information 
    in a form that is personally identifiable. <br>

     <br>
    Advertisements may be managed and placed on our Web site by third parties 
    that are called "network advertisers."  Network advertisers 
    who place advertisements on our Web site may use cookies and Web beacons 
    to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits 
    to our Web site and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements 
    about goods and services of interest to you.  If you would like to obtain 
    more information about the practices of some of these network advertisers 
    and to make choices about their use of your information, please <u>click 
    here</u>.  Finally, please keep in mind that if you click on an 
    advertisement on our Web site and link to a third party's Web site, 
    then our Privacy Policy will not apply to your personally identifiable 
    information collected on that third party's Web site and you must 
    read the privacy policy posted on that site to see how your personally 
    identifiable information will be handled. <br>
     <br>
    <u>Information That We Collect from Others </u>

     <br>
     <br>
    We may update and supplement personally identifiable information that 
    we have collected directly from our guests with other information that 
    we obtain from third parties and other members of The Walt Disney Family 
    of Companies.  In addition, we may obtain personally identifiable information 
    about individuals who are not yet users of our Web site or guests of 
    The Walt Disney Family of Companies.  In addition, when we associate 
    information that we obtain from third parties or other members of The 
    Walt Disney Family of Companies with personally identifiable information 
    that we have collected under this Privacy Policy, we will treat the 
    acquired information like the information that we collected ourselves 
    and, except as permitted by this Privacy Policy, the information will 
    not be shared with third parties.</font> <br></p>

    below, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may use your personally identifiable 
    information in many ways, including sending you promotional materials, 
    and sharing your information with third parties so that these third 
    parties can send you promotional materials.  (By "promotional materials," 
    we mean communications that directly promote the use of Web sites, or 
    the purchase of products or services.)  As outlined below in A4, you 
    may "opt out" of certain uses of your personal information. <br>

     <br>
    <u>General Provisions for Sharing and Use by The Walt 
    Disney Family of Companies, Licensees and Co-Branding Participants </u>
     <br>
     <br>
    Personally identifiable information collected under this Privacy Policy 
    is shared among and used by The Walt Disney Family of Companies for 
    many purposes.  For example, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may 
    use your personal information to send you promotional materials about 
    goods and services (including special offers and promotions) either 
    offered by The Walt Disney Family of Companies or offered by third parties.  
    These promotional materials may be sent to you by postal mail, e-mail 
    or other means.  You may opt out of receiving these communications as 
    provided in A4 below.  Please keep in mind, however, that when you purchase 
    or request products or services (or information about products or services) 
    from a particular member of The Walt Disney Family of Companies, promotional 
    materials about goods and services offered by another member of The 
    Walt Disney Family of Companies and/or by a third party may accompany 
    delivery of the product, service or information that you have requested.  
    We refer to sending you promotional materials in these circumstances 
    as "Fulfillment Uses" of your personal information.  Because 
    these promotional materials accompany products, services or information 
    that you have requested, your opt-outs for Individual Disney Companies, 
    The Walt Disney Family of Companies and Third Parties under A4 below 
    will not apply to any of these Fulfillment Uses. <br>

     <br>
    The Walt Disney Family of Companies may also use your personal information 
    for many purposes other than sending you promotional materials.  (We 
    refer to all of these types of uses of your personal information that 
    do not involve the sending of promotional materials as "Operational 
    Uses.")  For example, we may use your information to complete transactions 
    requested by you (such as your purchase of a product or service offered 
    on our Web site), or to send you administrative communications either 
    about your account with us or about features of our Web site, including 
    any future changes to this Privacy Policy.  Because these uses of your 
    personal information do not involve sending you promotional materials, 
    your opt-outs under A4 below will not apply to any of these Operational 
    Uses.  <br>
     <br>
    In addition to using your personal information within The Walt Disney 
    Family of Companies, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may share your 
    personal information with companies that offer products and/or services 
    under brand names or using characters or other intellectual property 
    of The Walt Disney Family of Companies.  These companies are called 
    "licensees."  The Walt Disney Family of Companies may also 
    share your personal information with companies that offer products and/or 
    services that are co-branded using brand names of The Walt Disney Family 
    of Companies.  These companies are called "co-branding participants."  
    When The Walt Disney Family of Companies shares personal information 
    with third parties acting as licensees and co-branding participants, 
    these licensees and co-branding participants are restricted by contract 
    from using the personal information for any marketing or promotional 
    purpose that is not related to a licensed or co-branded product or service.  
    Finally, to further protect your privacy, these licensees and co-branding 
    participants' use of personal information shared with them under this 
    Privacy Policy is subject to the same opt-out rights (and limitations 
    upon those rights) that apply to use of personal information by members 
    of The Walt Disney Family of Companies under A4 below. <br>

     <br>
    Finally, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may take your personally 
    identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either 
    by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating 
    your information with information about other individuals), or by removing 
    characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally 
    identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information).  Given the 
    nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy 
    Policy upon the right of The Walt Disney Family of Companies to aggregate 
    or de-personalize your personal information, and The Walt Disney Family 
    of Companies may use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally 
    identifiable information in any way.</font>
    <p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana"> <br>
    <u>Third Parties Offering Promotions, Products, or Services </u>
     <br>
     <br>

    Subject to your opt-out choices (see A4 below), The Walt Disney Family 
    of Companies may share your personal information with selected third 
    parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods 
    and services (including special offers and promotions) offered by them.  
    (We call this type of sharing "promotional sharing" or sharing 
    for "promotional purposes.")  When sharing your information 
    for promotional purposes, The Walt Disney Family of Companies attempts 
    to select only reputable companies that offer high quality products 
    and services.  Moreover, The Walt Disney Family of Companies will not 
    share your e-mail address with third parties for promotional purposes, 
    except when you consent to such sharing in the course of your participation 
    in a Sponsored Activity as described below.  When The Walt Disney Family 
    of Companies shares your personal information with a third party under 
    any circumstance described in this "Third Parties Offering Promotions, 
    Products, or Services" section, your personal information will 
    become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices 
    of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this 
    Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal 
    information. <br>
     <br>
    In addition to the promotional sharing that is subject to your opt-out 
    choices under A4 below, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may also 
    share your information when you engage in certain activities on our 
    site that are sponsored by third parties, such as purchasing products 
    or services offered by a third party, electing to receive information 
    or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in 
    contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or 
    in part by a third party.  The Walt Disney Family of Companies may also 
    share your personal information when you respond to promotional materials 
    from The Walt Disney Family of Companies and authorize a third party 
    to use your personal information for purposes such as, for example, 
    sending you additional promotional materials, providing you a product 
    or service, or entering you in a contest, sweepstakes or game.  (We 
    refer to all of these activities and requests as "Sponsored Activities.")  
    When you participate in Sponsored Activities, you will either be required 
    or requested to agree that the sponsor or business associate may use 
    your personal information (including, in some cases, your e-mail address) 
    in accordance with the sponsor or business associate's privacy practices.  
    Since you will have consented to this specific instance of sharing of 
    your personal information, the opt-out choice for "Third Parties" 
    described in A4 below will not apply. <br>

     <br>
    <u>Companies That Facilitate Communications and Transactions with You</u> <br>
     <br>
    Sometimes The Walt Disney Family of Companies hires companies to help 
    provide products or services, like a shipping company that delivers 
    a package or a company that helps fulfill prizes for a sweepstakes.  
    In those instances, there is a need to share your information with these 
    companies.  Sometimes The Walt Disney Family of Companies also works 
    with other companies who help either gather your information or communicate 
    with you, such as a company that helps to provide customer service.  
    Your opt-out choices under A4 below will not apply to sharing by The 
    Walt Disney Family of Companies of your personal information with any 
    of these companies. Nonetheless, except as separately permitted by other 
    provisions of this Privacy Policy, these companies are allowed to gather, 
    receive, and use your information only for the purposes described in 
    this paragraph or to facilitate compliance with laws. <br>
     <br>
    <u>Companies That You Previously Authorized to Obtain Your Information </u>

     <br>
     <br>
    In certain circumstances, your dealings with a third party may have 
    authorized that third party to obtain your personal information from 
    The Walt Disney Family of Companies and to use that information in accordance 
    with the third party's own privacy practices and policies.  For example, 
    in using an online shopping service (such as the shopping services offered 
    by Internet portals that refer the portal's users to third-party merchants), 
    you may have authorized that shopping service to obtain from the service's 
    participating third-party merchants (including The Walt Disney Family 
    of Companies) information about your purchases conducted through the 
    shopping service.  In such circumstances, your opt-out elections under 
    A4 below will not apply to sharing of your personal information by The 
    Walt Disney Family of Companies.  Nonetheless, The Walt Disney Family 
    of Companies will provide such companies only the information that you 
    authorized (except as separately permitted under other provisions of 
    this Privacy Policy).  In the example given above, the shopping service 
    would be provided only information concerning purchases you made from 
    The Walt Disney Family of Companies through that shopping service, and 
    would not be provided any other information concerning you, unless any 
    additional sharing of your personal information were separately permitted 
    under another provision of this Privacy Policy. <br>
     <br>
    <u>Purchase or Sale of Businesses </u>
     <br>

     <br>
    From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of 
    our businesses (or portions thereof) and your personally identifiable 
    information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.  In 
    the event that we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information 
    received with that business would be treated in accordance with this 
    Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.  In the 
    event that we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling 
    contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable 
    information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including 
    any amendments to this Privacy Policy).  In light of this protection, 
    your opt-out choices under A4 will not affect our right to transfer 
    your information to a purchaser in these circumstances.  The provisions 
    of this paragraph will also apply in the event that one or more businesses 
    of any other member of The Walt Disney Family of Companies are sold 
    and personal information subject to this Privacy Policy is transferred 
    to a purchaser of those businesses. <br>
     <br>
    <u>Disclosures to Comply With Laws and Disclosures to Help Protect the 
    Security and Safety of Our Web Site, The Walt Disney Family of Companies 
    and Others </u> <br>
     <br>

    Regardless of any opt-out choices that you make under A4, The Walt Disney 
    Family of Companies will disclose personal information when it believes 
    in good faith that such disclosures (a) facilitate compliance with laws, 
    including, for example, compliance with a court order or subpoena, or 
    (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, 
    promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including 
    the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect 
    the safety and security of our Web site, The Walt Disney Family of Companies, 
    and/or third parties, including the safety and security of property 
    that belongs to The Walt Disney Family of Companies or third parties.</font> <br>

    <td><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana">With regard to personal 
    information that you have provided under this Privacy Policy, there 
    are three separate opt-out choices available to you.  These opt-out 
    choices are the means by which you give us, or decline to give us, your 
    consent to use your personal information for the purposes covered by 
    these opt-out choices.  You can exercise your opt-out choices during 
    the registration process on this Web site and as described below in 
    A6.  Each of these opt-out choices is subject to the exceptions described 
    further below in this A4. <br>

     <br>
    Your three opt-out choices are:</font>
    <p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana"> <br>
    <u>Third Parties</u>: You may choose to opt out of receiving promotional 
    materials from third parties.  If you do not choose this opt-out, The 
    Walt Disney Family of Companies may share your personal information 
    so that third parties can send you these promotional materials.  Please 
    bear in mind that this opt-out choice for "Third Parties" 
    will not apply to the licensees and co-branding participants described 
    above in A3. <br>
     <br>

    <u>The Walt Disney Family of Companies</u>: You may choose to opt out 
    of receiving promotional materials from members of The Walt Disney Family 
    of Companies, including the licensees and co-branding participants described 
    above in A3.  Your election to choose this "The Walt Disney Family 
    of Companies" opt-out will not, however, override any consent that 
    you provide to receive promotional materials from iParenting.com.  <br>
     <br>
    <u>iParenting.com</u>: You may choose to opt out of receiving promotional 
    materials directly from iParenting.com during the registration process 
    on this Web site or as described below in A6.  However, if you do not 
    also opt out of receiving promotional materials from "The Walt 
    Disney Family of Companies" as described in the preceding paragraph, 
    you may still receive promotional materials from iParenting.com.  <br>

     <br>
    Please keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply 
    in situations where (a) you either have made, simultaneously make, or 
    later make a specific request for information from a member of The Walt 
    Disney Family of Companies, (b) The Walt Disney Family of Companies 
    uses your personal information for either "Operational Uses" 
    or "Fulfillment Uses" (as described above in A3), (c) you 
    either have engaged, simultaneously engage, or later engage in Sponsored 
    Activities (as described above in A3), or (d) The Walt Disney Family 
    of Companies shares your personal information under the provisions of 
    A3 above with respect to "Companies That Facilitate Communications 
    and Transactions With You," "Companies That You Previously 
    Authorized to Obtain Your Information," "Purchase or Sale 
    of Businesses," or "Disclosures to Comply with Laws and Disclosures 
    to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Web Site, The Walt Disney 
    Family of Companies and Others."  Also, any opt-out choices 
    you make will not apply to personal information that you provide about 
    other persons, but these other persons will have the opportunity to 
    opt out of receiving promotional materials. <br>

     <br>
    In addition, any time that we send you promotional materials that you 
    have consented to receive under one of the previously described opt-out 
    choices, we may accompany those materials with promotional materials 
    covered by the other opt-out choices.  We may do so even if you 
    have opted out of receiving promotional materials covered by those other 
    opt-out choices.  Any such additional promotional materials, however, 
    will constitute only a minor part of any particular communication with 
    you.  </font> <br></p>
    <p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, if you do 
    not exercise your opt-out choices upon registration or initial log-in 
    at our Web site, it may take up to ninety (90) days for your opt-out 
    choices to be fully effective.  Our systems require time to update, 
    and promotional mailings using your personal information shared before 
    your opt-out may already be in process.  Finally, please keep in 
    mind that, if you have not consistently used the same postal and email 
    addresses on our Web site, or if you have used a general change of address 
    process (such as the change of address process offered by the U.S. Post 
    Office) after providing address information on our Web site, systems 
    maintained by members of The Walt Disney Family of Companies may have 
    varying contact information for you.  Accordingly, it may not always 
    be possible to match your new opt-out choices with your personal information 
    that you previously have provided.</font> <br></p>
