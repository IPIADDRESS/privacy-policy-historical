<h3>Q1:</h3>
<p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>What
information does this Privacy Policy cover?</b></font><br>
</p>

<h3>A1:</h3>
<p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana">Except as
specifically described below in A2 and A6, this Privacy Policy
applies only to personally identifiable information collected on
the Web site where this Privacy Policy is posted and does not
apply to any other information collected by The Walt Disney
Family of Companies through any other means.<br>
<br>
 As used in this Privacy Policy, "The Walt Disney Family of
Companies" refers to The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiary
and affiliated entities, singly or together, including companies
such as ABC and ESPN that generally do not offer their products
and services under the "Disney" brand name, as well as companies
that generally do offer their products and services under the
"Disney" brand name. (At times, our Web site refers to The Walt
Disney Family of Companies as "The Walt Disney family of
companies.") The Walt Disney Internet Group (including its
subsidiaries) is a member of The Walt Disney Family of Companies,
and is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "WDIG," "we," "us,"
"our," and "ourselves."<br>
<br>
 In keeping with the traditions of The Walt Disney Company, we
refer to individuals who purchase or use products or services of
The Walt Disney Family of Companies as "guests." When this
Privacy Policy uses the term "personally identifiable
information," we mean information that identifies a particular
individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address,
e-mail address, and telephone number. When other information
(such as, for example, consumer product preferences or number of
children) is directly associated with personally identifiable
information, this other information also is treated as personally
identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Personally identifiable information does not include screen names
(also known as member names, usernames or other online aliases)
provided by our guests in the course of registering with or using
our Web site, except in circumstances in which we request that
guests provide their e-mail addresses as their screen names.
Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in
this Privacy Policy as "personal information." Finally, the terms
of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable
laws.</font></p>

<h3>Q2:</h3>
<p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>What types of
personally identifiable information do we collect about our
guests?</b></font><br>
</p>

<h3>A2:</h3>

<p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana">We collect
several types of personally identifiable information about our
guests.<br>
<br>
 <u>Information You Provide to Us</u><br>
<br>
 Much of the personally identifiable information we receive comes
directly from guests who are interested in obtaining various
products and services from us or another member of The Walt
Disney Family of Companies. Typically, this information includes
the guest’s name, postal address, e-mail address, and
telephone number. We may also collect other types of information
such as gender, age, number of children, and personal interests,
which we may associate with personally identifiable information.
If you purchase products or services from us or another member of
The Walt Disney Family of Companies, we’ll note, for
example, credit card information, the type of services or
products ordered or purchased, and the date of the order or
purchase. You may also provide us photographs or other video
materials, which may contain personal information. We may collect
personal information when you register on, log on, or visit our
Web site, including when you participate in activities on our Web
site, such as sweepstakes, contests, games, and informational and
promotional offers, and when you provide information to our
customer service representatives</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font> <font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, our Web site may offer message boards,
conversation pages, chat rooms, social community environments,
profile pages, and other Public Forums (as defined in the Terms
of Use governing our Web site (the “Terms of Use”)),
as well as other features in which you may provide us with User
Submissions (as defined in the Terms of Use). If you provide
personal information when you use any of these features, that
personal information may be publicly posted and otherwise
disclosed without limitation as to its use by a third party. Our
rules regarding User Submissions are described in the Terms of
Use, including in the “User Submissions,”
“Public Forums and Communication” and “House
Rules” sections of the Terms of Use.<br>
<br>
 <u>Information Collected Through Technology</u><br>
<br>
 We collect information through technology to make our site more
interesting and useful to you and for various purposes related to
our business. For instance, when you come to our site, we collect
your IP address. An IP address is associated with the access
point through which you enter the Internet, and is typically
controlled by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your company,
or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not
personally identifiable. We may use IP addresses to collect
information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit
various parts of our site, and we may combine IP addresses with
personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
 Our Web site collects information through a variety of technical
methods, including cookies and Web beacons. Cookies are pieces of
information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are
viewing the Web site. Web beacons are small pieces of data that
are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. Cookies, web
beacons and other technical methods may involve the transmission
of information either directly to us or to another party
authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.</font><br>

<h3>Q3:</h3>
<p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>How is your
personally identifiable information used and
shared?</b></font><br>
</p>

<h3>A3:</h3>

<p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana">As described in
detail below, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may use your
personally identifiable information in many ways, including
sending you promotional materials, and sharing your information
with third parties so that these third parties can send you
promotional materials. (By "promotional materials," we mean
communications that directly promote the use of Web sites, or the
purchase of products or services.) As outlined below in A4, you
may "opt out" of certain uses of your personal information.<br>
<br>
 <u>General Provisions for Sharing and Use by The Walt Disney
Family of Companies, Licensees and Co-Branding
Participants</u><br>
<br>
 Personally identifiable information collected under this Privacy
Policy is shared among and used by The Walt Disney Family of
Companies for many purposes. For example, The Walt Disney Family
of Companies may use your personal information to send you
promotional materials about goods and services (including special
offers and promotions) either offered by The Walt Disney Family
of Companies or offered by third parties. These promotional
materials may be sent to you by postal mail, e-mail or other
means. You may opt out of receiving these communications as
provided in A4 below. Please keep in mind, however, that when you
purchase or request products or services (or information about
products or services) from a particular member of The Walt Disney
Family of Companies, promotional materials about goods and
services offered by another member of The Walt Disney Family of
Companies and/or by a third party may accompany delivery of the
product, service or information that you have requested. We refer
to sending you promotional materials in these circumstances as
"Fulfillment Uses" of your personal information. Because these
promotional materials accompany products, services or information
that you have requested, your opt-outs for Individual Disney
Companies, The Walt Disney Family of Companies and Third Parties
under A4 below will not apply to any of these Fulfillment
Uses.<br>
<br>
 The Walt Disney Family of Companies may also use your personal
information for many purposes other than sending you promotional
materials. (We refer to all of these types of uses of your
personal information that do not involve the sending of
promotional materials as "Operational Uses.") For example, we may
use your information to complete transactions requested by you
(such as your purchase of a product or service offered on our Web
site), or to send you administrative communications either about
your account with us or about features of our Web site, including
any future changes to this Privacy Policy. Because these uses of
your personal information do not involve sending you promotional
materials, your opt-outs under A4 below will not apply to any of
these Operational Uses.<br>
<br>
 In addition to using your personal information within The Walt
Disney Family of Companies, The Walt Disney Family of Companies
may share your personal information with companies that offer
products and/or services under brand names or using characters or
other intellectual property of The Walt Disney Family of
Companies. These companies are called "licensees." The Walt
Disney Family of Companies may also share your personal
information with companies that offer products and/or services
that are co-branded using brand names of The Walt Disney Family
of Companies. These companies are called "co-branding
participants." When The Walt Disney Family of Companies shares
personal information with third parties acting as licensees and
co-branding participants, these licensees and co-branding
participants are restricted by contract from using the personal
information for any marketing or promotional purpose that is not
related to a licensed or co-branded product or service. Finally,
to further protect your privacy, these licensees and co-branding
participants’ use of personal information shared with them
under this Privacy Policy is subject to the same opt-out rights
(and limitations upon those rights) that apply to use of personal
information by members of The Walt Disney Family of Companies
under A4 below.<br>
<br>
 Finally, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may take your
personally identifiable information and make it non-personally
identifiable, either by combining it with information about other
individuals (aggregating your information with information about
other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your
name) that make the information personally identifiable to you
(de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this
information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy
upon the right of The Walt Disney Family of Companies to
aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and The
Walt Disney Family of Companies may use and/or share with third
parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information in
any way.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 <u>Third Parties Offering Promotions, Products, or
Services</u><br>
<br>
 Subject to your opt-out choices (see A4 below), The Walt Disney
Family of Companies may share your personal information with
selected third parties so that they can send you promotional
materials about goods and services (including special offers and
promotions) offered by them. (We call this type of sharing
"promotional sharing" or sharing for "promotional purposes.")
When sharing your information for promotional purposes, The Walt
Disney Family of Companies attempts to select only reputable
companies that offer high quality products and services.
Moreover, The Walt Disney Family of Companies will not share your
e-mail address with third parties for promotional purposes,
except when you consent to such sharing in the course of your
participation in a Sponsored Activity as described below. When
The Walt Disney Family of Companies shares your personal
information with a third party under any circumstance described
in this "Third Parties Offering Promotions, Products, or
Services" section, your personal information will become
permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices
of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by
this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing
of your personal information.<br>
<br>
 In addition to the promotional sharing that is subject to your
opt-out choices under A4 below, The Walt Disney Family of
Companies may also share your information when you engage in
certain activities on our site that are sponsored by third
parties, such as purchasing products or services offered by a
third party, electing to receive information or communications
from a third party, or electing to participate in contests,
sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in
part by a third party. The Walt Disney Family of Companies may
also share your personal information when you respond to
promotional materials from The Walt Disney Family of Companies
and authorize a third party to use your personal information for
purposes such as, for example, sending you additional promotional
materials, providing you a product or service, or entering you in
a contest, sweepstakes or game. (We refer to all of these
activities and requests as "Sponsored Activities.") When you
participate in Sponsored Activities, you will either be required
or requested to agree that the sponsor or business associate may
use your personal information (including, in some cases, your
e-mail address) in accordance with the sponsor or business
associate’s privacy practices. Since you will have
consented to this specific instance of sharing of your personal
information, the opt-out choice for "Third Parties" described in
A4 below will not apply.<br>
<br>
 <u>Companies That Facilitate Communications and Transactions
with You</u><br>
<br>
 Sometimes The Walt Disney Family of Companies hires companies to
help provide products or services, like a shipping company that
delivers a package or a company that helps fulfill prizes for a
sweepstakes. In those instances, there is a need to share your
information with these companies. Sometimes The Walt Disney
Family of Companies also works with other companies who help
either gather your information or communicate with you, such as a
company that helps to provide customer service. Your opt-out
choices under A4 below will not apply to sharing by The Walt
Disney Family of Companies of your personal information with any
of these companies. Nonetheless, except as separately permitted
by other provisions of this Privacy Policy, these companies are
allowed to gather, receive, and use your information only for the
purposes described in this paragraph or to facilitate compliance
with laws.<br>
<br>
 <u>Companies That You Previously Authorized to Obtain Your
Information</u><br>
<br>
 In certain circumstances, your dealings with a third party may
have authorized that third party to obtain your personal
information from The Walt Disney Family of Companies and to use
that information in accordance with the third party’s own
privacy practices and policies. For example, in using an online
shopping service (such as the shopping services offered by
Internet portals that refer the portal’s users to
third-party merchants), you may have authorized that shopping
service to obtain from the service’s participating
third-party merchants (including The Walt Disney Family of
Companies) information about your purchases conducted through the
shopping service. In such circumstances, your opt-out elections
under A4 below will not apply to sharing of your personal
information by The Walt Disney Family of Companies. Nonetheless,
The Walt Disney Family of Companies will provide such companies
only the information that you authorized (except as separately
permitted under other provisions of this Privacy Policy). In the
example given above, the shopping service would be provided only
information concerning purchases you made from The Walt Disney
Family of Companies through that shopping service, and would not
be provided any other information concerning you, unless any
additional sharing of your personal information were separately
permitted under another provision of this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
 <u>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</u><br>
<br>
 From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or
more of our businesses (or portions thereof) and your personally
identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the
purchase or sale. In the event that we purchase a business, the
personally identifiable information received with that business
would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is
practicable and permissible to do so. In the event that we sell a
business, we will include provisions in the selling contract
requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable
information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy
(including any amendments to this Privacy Policy). In light of
this protection, your opt-out choices under A4 will not affect
our right to transfer your information to a purchaser in these
circumstances. The provisions of this paragraph will also apply
in the event that one or more businesses of any other member of
The Walt Disney Family of Companies are sold and personal
information subject to this Privacy Policy is transferred to a
purchaser of those businesses.<br>
<br>
 <u>Disclosures to Comply With Laws and Disclosures to Help
Protect the Security and Safety of Our Web Site, The Walt Disney
Family of Companies and Others</u><br>
<br>
 Regardless of any opt-out choices that you make under A4, The
Walt Disney Family of Companies will disclose personal
information when it believes in good faith that such disclosures
(a) facilitate compliance with laws, including, for example,
compliance with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to:
enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes,
promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security,
including the safety and security of property that belongs to
you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our Web site, The
Walt Disney Family of Companies, and/or third parties, including
the safety and security of property that belongs to The Walt
Disney Family of Companies or third parties.</font><br>

<p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>What choices
do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your
personally identifiable information?</b></font><br>
</p>

<h3>A4:</h3>

<p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana">With regard to
personal information that you have provided under this Privacy
Policy, there are three separate opt-out choices available to
you. These opt-out choices are the means by which you give us, or
decline to give us, your consent to use your personal information
for the purposes covered by these opt-out choices. You can
exercise your opt-out choices during the registration process on
this Web site and as described below in A6. Each of these opt-out
choices is subject to the exceptions described further below in
this A4.<br>
<br>
 Your three opt-out choices are:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 <u>Third Parties</u>: You may choose to opt out of receiving
promotional materials from third parties. If you do not choose
this opt-out, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may share your
personal information so that third parties can send you these
promotional materials. Please bear in mind that this opt-out
choice for "Third Parties" will not apply to the licensees and
co-branding participants described above in A3.<br>
<br>
 <u>The Walt Disney Family of Companies</u>: You may choose to
opt out of receiving promotional materials from members of The
Walt Disney Family of Companies, including the licensees and
co-branding participants described above in A3. Your election to
choose this "The Walt Disney Family of Companies" opt-out will
not, however, override any consent that you provide to receive
promotional materials from iParenting.com.<br>
<br>
 <u>Disney Family</u>: You may choose to opt out of receiving
promotional materials directly from Disney Family during the
registration process on this Web site or as described below in
A6. However, if you do not also opt out of receiving promotional
materials from "The Walt Disney Family of Companies" as described
in the preceding paragraph, you may still receive promotional
materials from Disney Family.<br>
<br>
 Please keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not
apply in situations where (a) you either have made,
simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for
information from a member of The Walt Disney Family of Companies,
(b) The Walt Disney Family of Companies uses your personal
information for either "Operational Uses" or "Fulfillment Uses"
(as described above in A3), (c) you either have engaged,
simultaneously engage, or later engage in Sponsored Activities
(as described above in A3), or (d) The Walt Disney Family of
Companies shares your personal information under the provisions
of A3 above with respect to "Companies That Facilitate
Communications and Transactions With You," "Companies That You
Previously Authorized to Obtain Your Information," "Purchase or
Sale of Businesses," or "Disclosures to Comply with Laws and
Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Web
Site, The Walt Disney Family of Companies and Others." Also, any
opt-out choices you make will not apply to personal information
that you provide about other persons, but these other persons
will have the opportunity to opt out of receiving promotional
materials.<br>
<br>
 In addition, any time that we send you promotional materials
that you have consented to receive under one of the previously
described opt-out choices, we may accompany those materials with
promotional materials covered by the other opt-out choices. We
may do so even if you have opted out of receiving promotional
materials covered by those other opt-out choices. Any such
additional promotional materials, however, will constitute only a
minor part of any particular communication with you.</font><br>
</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, if you
do not exercise your opt-out choices upon registration or initial
log-in at our Web site, it may take up to ninety (90) days for
your opt-out choices to be fully effective. Our systems require
time to update, and promotional mailings using your personal
information shared before your opt-out may already be in process.
Finally, please keep in mind that, if you have not consistently
used the same postal and email addresses on our Web site, or if
you have used a general change of address process (such as the
change of address process offered by the U.S. Post Office) after
providing address information on our Web site, systems maintained
by members of The Walt Disney Family of Companies may have
varying contact information for you. Accordingly, it may not
always be possible to match your new opt-out choices with your
personal information that you previously have
provided.</font><br>
