<p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you as a user of this Website, how this information is used, and how you can opt-out of certain types of processing. In the UK, we operate and are registered in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.</p>
<p>By using this Website you are consenting to the use of your information as set out in this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Who are we?<br>
</strong><br>
The Press Association Limited is the owner of this Website, and is a member of the PA Group.<br>
<br>
*PA Group means PA Group Limited and any other company which is more than 50% owned or controlled by PA Group Limited (company number 4197) or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries (such as The Press Association Limited, PA Photos Limited or PA Sport UK Limited) from time to time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>What personal information do we collect and why?<br>
</strong><br>
We may collect personal information from you (such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, bank account details etc) when you complete registration or enquiry forms or send emails to us. Please do not submit your personal information to us if you do not wish us to collect it.<br>
<br>
If you login or subscribe to any PA Group service or product, we will use your personal information to provide you with the service or product you select (e.g. sending you password reminders or notices about the relevant service or product being suspended for emergency or routine maintenance). <br>
<br>
In addition, we may collect information from you, for example, in order to reply to any enquiry you make of any PA Group company or notify you of a change to our service. We may also use the information you provide for our own internal statistical purposes. <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of your personal information for marketing purposes <br>
</strong><br>
We may give your personal information to other companies within the PA Group, for the purposes of providing products and services you have requested from us and so that those group companies can provide you with information relating to products and services we think may interest you, by letter, email or on your mobile device.<br>
<br>
If you do not wish to receive this promotional material, you may opt-out by:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><br>
<strong>Disclosure of personal information to third parties<br>
</strong><br>
We will not disclose any personal information you provide to us to any third party organisation outside the PA Group of companies, unless:</p>
<ul>
    <li>we need to do so to provide you with the products or services you select;</li>
    <li>we are obliged or permitted by law to disclose it;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;</li>
    <li>a PA Group company or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it may be one of the transferred assets; or</li>
    <li>to protect the rights, property, or safety of any PA Group Company, its customers, employees, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<strong>What other information do we collect and why?<br>
</strong><br>
We, and our third party partners, collect information about your use of this Website, including advertisements delivered to you and your general internet usage, in order to deliver a better service to you. This information is collected using cookies, tracking tags and other methods, and may include your IP address. More details, including information on how to opt-out of this processing, are set out below.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of cookies<br>
</strong><br>
Cookies are text files stored by your browser software that identify your computer to the cookie owner's server. We may use cookies to remember you when you visit this Website, to obtain information about your general internet usage and build up a profile of how you and others use this Website, and to improve our Website and deliver a better service to you. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the settings of cookies. However, if you select this setting, you may be unable to use the full functionality of our Website and your user experience may be adversely affected.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Third party cookies, action tags<br>
</strong><br>
We may use the services of third parties (such as Google Analytics and SalesForce) to analyse the way in which users interact with this Website (for example, search patterns) and to deliver the advertisements you see on this Website. <br>
<br>
These third parties may generate their own cookies in your browser software and use action tags and other methods to collect and compile information about the advertisements you have seen and "clickstream" data (eg., behavioural data, IP addresses, log files, and other traffic data) relating to your online browsing. <br>
<br>
These cookies cannot be used to identify an individual. They can only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Some of the information gleaned from third party cookies and action tags will be aggregated with other anonymous information for statistical purposes. <br>
<br>
We don't have access to these cookies. We only allow them to be served. However, we may use the statistical information provided to us by our partners arising from these third party cookies, for example, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users of the Website. <br>
<br>
The third parties that generate these cookies and action tags have their own privacy policies describing how they use the information that they collect. <br>
<br>
If you would like to disable third party cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to the third party's website and getting them to generate an "opt-out" cookie that will stop any further cookies being written to your computer. Visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website at <a onclick="window.open(this.href,'','resizable=yes,location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,status=no,toolbar=no,fullscreen=no,dependent=yes,status'); return false" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a><strong> </strong>for information on how to obtain an "opt-out cookie". <br>

This Website may contain links to other websites which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please note that, if you access other websites using the links provided, the operators of these websites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.<br>

<strong>Data Security<br>
</strong><br>
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or in secure filing systems.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us via the internet; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.<br>
