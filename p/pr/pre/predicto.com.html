<p><strong>PredictoMobile™ Privacy Policy </strong><strong><br>
      <br>
      <strong>Last Updated: June 30, 2010</strong></strong> <br>
      <br>
  PredictoMobile, LLC (“PredictoMobile™,” “we” or “us”) operates the  PredictoMobile™ website located at www.predictomobile.com (the “Website”), and  the PredictoMobile™ service that includes the provision of interactive mobile  content, such as news alerts, sweepstakes, surveys and quizzes, available  online or via text messaging (“Service”). This privacy policy (“Privacy  Policy”) outlines the privacy practices associated with the Website and the Service  and covers our treatment of personal information that we collect when you: (a)  visit the Website; (b) register for the Service, either as a premium member  (“Premium Member”) or as a web basic (“Web Basic”) or mobile basic (“Mobile  Basic”) member (collectively, “Basic Members” and together with Premium  Members, “Members”); (c) enter any of the various drawings and/or sweepstakes  that we may offer from time to time (“Sweepstakes”); (d) respond to any of our  surveys or quizzes (“Surveys”); and/or (e) submit any other material to us,  such as comments on surveys, user profile information or personal quotes  relating to redeeming Loyalty Points or winning a Sweepstakes. By visiting the  Website, subscribing for the Service, responding to a Survey or entering a Sweepstakes,  you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. It is important that  Website visitors, Members and Sweepstakes entrants are fully informed about the  use of their personal information. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Personal Information We Collect From You<br>
</strong><br>
  <strong>Registration.</strong> When you register for our Service as a  Premium Member, we require that you provide your mobile telephone number and  provide and retain the PIN number that we supply to you. If you register on our  Website for a Basic Membership or if your Premium Membership is converted into  a Basic Membership, we require that you provide your email address. On our  registration page we ask our Members to provide their: (a) first and last name;  (b) date of birth; (c) home address; (d) email address; (e) mobile and/or home  telephone number; (f) time zone; (g) screen name; (h) an icon or photograph;  (i) a personal quote; and/or (j) any other information from or about an  individual that we may request from time to time. If you elect to provide your  mobile telephone number, you will be prompted to opt-in by checking a box to  receive survey questions via text messaging that will include unrelated third  party ads. If you do so, you will become a Mobile Basic Member. This  information is not required in order to complete registration. We also collect  your IP address when you register. We refer to information that identifies you  such as your name, cell phone number, email address and home address as  “Personally Identifiable Information” in this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Website Visitors</strong>. We collect information when you visit the  Website through cookies, clear gifs and other means such as your IP address,  browser type, ISP, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and  clickstream data. We store this information (“Log File Information”) in log  files.<br>
  <strong><br>
  Sweepstakes.</strong> If you are not a Member and mail in an entry  for a given Sweepstakes, we collect your name and mailing address, home or cell  phone number, and Sweepstakes ID when you enter the Sweepstakes. We do not  collect Social Security Numbers unless you are a Sweepstakes winner and your  prize has a monetary value that requires that we report your winnings to the  Internal Revenue Service. If you win one of our Sweepstakes, you will be  required to provide your mailing address if we have not already collected it  and the following additional personal information (please see the applicable  Sweepstakes Rules for additional details): (i) Social Security Number (if  necessary, depending on the amount of your prize); and (ii) a copy of a government  issued photo identification. If you win one of our Sweepstakes, we also require  that you complete and submit a release which allows us to identify you as a  winner on the Website and in other promotional materials. We may also ask you  for a quote and a photograph. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How We Use Personal Information</strong> <br>
  <br>
Any personal information that you submit to us remains your property  however, we may use this personal information to administer the Website,  Service and Sweepstakes as described below.</p>
<p><strong>Text Messages and Other Communications.</strong> By  providing your mobile telephone number, you expressly consent to receive a sign-up  text message from us.&nbsp; In most  circumstances, the text message that you receive in connection with the sign-up  process will contain a unique, four digit personal identification number which  is used to set up your account.&nbsp; If your  wireless carrier does not support our Service, or you do not complete the  sign-up process in full, you expressly consent to receive one promotional text  message from us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By signing-up as a Premium  Member, you expressly consent to receive Surveys and other communications from  us periodically, typically weekly, via text message.&nbsp; As a Premium Member, you may control the  frequency with which you receive communications by changing your account  preferences on the Website.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By registering for a Mobile Basic Membership, or if your Membership is  downgraded from a Premium Membership to a Basic Membership, you expressly  consent to receive (a) Surveys, with advertising information contained therein,  via text message; and (b) other advertising content via email. <br>
  <br>
  You can opt-out from receiving any further promotional text messages or  emails by replying via text message with the word “STOP” or following the  opt-out instructions in the email. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Service-Related Announcements.</strong> We will send you  service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, for  Premium Members we send text messages monthly to remind you that your  membership is being renewed. If you cancel your membership, we may send you a  confirmatory text message or an email.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Customer Service.</strong> Based upon the Personally Identifiable  Information that you provide to us, we will send you a welcoming text message  or, for Basic Members, an email verifying your username and password. We will  also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the  services you request and to manage your account.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Supplementation Information.</strong> We verify the cell phone  numbers submitted by Premium Members when they sign up with information  provided by a third party.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Log File Information.</strong> When you visit our Website and use  our Service, we use Log File Information and survey responses to create a  “profile” of your preferences. We tie your Personally Identifiable Information  and your Survey responses to information in the profile to tailor the Surveys  that we send to you, and to improve the content of the Website. We also use  this information to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users’  movements around the Website and gather demographic information about our user  base as a whole. We link this automatically-collected data to Personally  Identifiable Information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Third Party Marketing.</strong> By submitting your Personal  Identifiable Information to us, you grant us the right, subject to applicable  state and federal law, to use that Personal Identifiable Information, other  than your Social Security Number, for marketing purposes. We may share, sell,  rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute any and all Personal Information with  or to any third-party for any and all uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and  applicable law. These third-parties may include: (a) providers of the products  and/or service that you requested and/or won by and through one of our Websites  and/or Services; (b) providers of direct marketing services and applications,  including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation;  (c) email marketers; (d) telemarketers; and (e) direct marketers.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong> <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Aggregate Information (Non-Personally Identifiable Information).</strong> We compile aggregated demographic information about our Members to better focus  our Service to meet our Members’ needs, preferences and to assist in our  marketing efforts. We may also share aggregated data about our Member base  including the number of Members that we have.<br>
  <br>
  We compile Survey responses and post the results on the Website and may use  the results in advertisements and other promotional materials. We may also  compare a Member’s response to a particular Survey to determine the number of  loyalty points awarded.<br>
  <br>
  Except as noted above, we do not link aggregate user data with Personally  Identifiable Information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> We reserve the right  to share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for  promotional purposes as described above. By submitting your Personal  Identifiable Information at our Website or via mobile device, you agree that  such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for purposes  of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. (the “ATSR”) and  you agree to receive email marketing from us and our third party advertisers.  Even if your telephone number is listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s  Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in  accordance with the ATSR. Moreover, if you register or make a purchase or  request information from a third party seller at or through our Website, this  will also constitute a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with the  respective third party seller for purposes of the ATSR and you may be contacted  via email, direct mail and/or telephone by that third party seller in  accordance with the ATSR. We also retain the right to contact you via  text-message based marketing in accordance with applicable state and federal  law even if your mobile telephone number is listed on state and/or federal  Do-Not-Call registries. Further, you agree that we reserve the right to share,  sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute your mobile telephone number and  other mobile data with/to any third-party for any and all non-marketing uses  permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law.<br>
  <br>
  By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent to disclosure of any  record or communication to any third party when we, in our sole discretion,  determine the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation,  sharing your email address with other third parties for suppression purposes in  compliance with the requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from  time-to-time.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Service Providers.</strong> For Premium Members, we share your cell  phone number with third party billing companies, cell phone carriers and our  third party customer care call center to facilitate billings, to process  credits and refunds, for customer service and to communicate with you via text  message. We may, from time-to-time, supplement the information we collect from  you with outside records (e.g., information we obtain from other companies,  including wireless providers) to enhance our ability to serve you. We may also  share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties so that we  can award prizes to Sweepstakes winners and when Members redeem loyalty points.  These third parties are prohibited from using your Personally Identifiable  Information for any other purpose.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Legal Disclaimer.</strong> We reserve the right to disclose your  Personally Identifiable Information: (a) as required by law and/or to comply  with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on the Website  or PredictoMobile™; (b) when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect  our rights; (c) if we believe that you are in violation of the terms and  conditions of this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service, any applicable Sweepstakes  Rules or any other of our operating rules, policies and other supplemental  terms and conditions or documents that may be made available by us from time to  time; or (d) if PredictoMobile™ is, or its assets are, sold or acquired.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Removal of Your Information/Opting Out</strong><br>
  <br>
  At your request, we will remove Personal Identifiable Information that you  have provided to us by emailing us at cs_support@PredictoMobile.com. However,  deleting your Personal Identifiable Information or otherwise opting-out of  receipt of communications from us or third parties will only change or delete  the data in our database for purposes of transacting future business on the  Websites and for managing future communications from us and third parties.  These deletions will also not change or delete Personal Identifiable  Information already collected as part of a particular transaction in our  database, which may have already been shared with third parties, all as  provided above in this Privacy Policy. You will need to contact third parties  who may contact you directly to change your preferences or your personal  information that they may be using to contact you.<br>
  <br>
  We provide users with the option to opt-out from receiving information sent  via email and/or text messaging on behalf of third party advertisers. Users may  unsubscribe from receiving emails and/or text messaging at any time by  following the instructions contained at the end of every email and/or text  message, as applicable. Unsubscribe requests can only be processed if you have  registered with us in the first instance. If you have not registered with us  and wish to opt out of receiving emails and/or text messaging, as applicable,  from a particular sender, please consult that sender’s opt out policies or  contact that sender.<br>
  <br>
  Information sent on behalf of third party advertisers may be prepared  several days in advance, so users may continue to receive email and/or text  messaging from us for up to ten days following the unsubscribe procedures  detailed above. If, after that point, a user is still receiving email and/or  text messaging from us, the user should contact us at  cs_support@PredictoMobile.com.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Cookies and Pixel Tags </strong><br>
  <br>
  “Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your web  browser software on your computer. The use of cookies is now an industry  standard and used by most major websites. We use cookies to recognize you and  personalize your viewing experience on the Website. For example, we use cookies  to recognize user access privileges to the Website, to track Website usage and  traffic patterns and to estimate our Website traffic. Although most web  browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you can decline  the placement of a cookie on your hard drive by using the appropriate  feature(s) of your web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie.  Please note, however, that certain areas of the Website may not function  properly if your web browser does not accept cookies.<br>
  <br>
  A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag consisting of a few lines of  computer coding placed on certain pages of websites you may visit. We may use  “pixel tags” to do "pixel tracking." Pixel tracking, a common  practice, uses pixel tags to track an individual user's online activity in  connection with online advertisements. Pixel tracking measures the  effectiveness of these advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage  statistics. For example, if you sign up for our Service or visit the Website  from an advertisement on another website, or in an HTML based email, the pixel  tag will allow the advertiser to track that their advertisement brought you to  our designated landing page and/or the Website. If you visit our Website and we  provide links to another website, we may also be able to determine that you  were sent to and/or transacted with that third party website from our Website.  This data is collected for use in our marketing and research. Personally  Identifiable Information about you is not collected by us in connection with  this process.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Links to Other Websites</strong> <br>
  <br>
  The Website may contain links to other websites that are not owned or  controlled by us. If you are a Mobile Basic Member and as such have opted-in to  receive unrelated third party ads, there may be links in the ads to websites  not owned or controlled by us. In either case, please be aware that we are not  responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites. We encourage you  to be aware when you leave our Website or otherwise access a third party’s  website, to read the privacy statements of each and every website that you  visit.<br>
  <br>
  This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by the Website.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Bulletin Boards / Chat Rooms / Public Profile Page</strong> <br>
  <br>
  If you use a bulletin board or chat room on the Website, you should be aware  that any Personally Identifiable Information that you submit there can be read,  collected and/or used by other users of those forums, and could be used to send  you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personally  Identifiable Information that you choose to submit in those forums. We reserve  the right to terminate the Member status of anyone who uses those forums in a  manner inconsistent with our Terms of Service.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
  <br>
  If your Personally Identifiable Information changes, or if you no longer desire  our Service, you may correct, update or delete your Personally Identifiable  Information by making the change(s) or deletions, as applicable, on your  MyProfile page on the Website, by emailing our Customer Support at  cs_support@PredictoMobile.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail  at the contact information listed below.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Minors </strong><br>
  <br>
  No information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Website by visitors  under eighteen (18) years of age without parental consent, and we do not  knowingly collect Personal Identifiable Information from such individuals  without parental consent. The Website and Service are not for use by  individuals under thirteen (13) years of age. If you are older than thirteen  (13) years of age but under eighteen (18) years of age, you may use the Website  and/or Service, but only where you have a parent’s consent, except for Florida State residents, where you must be at  least eighteen (18) years of age to use the Service. We encourage parents and  guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and  monitor the interactive activities of their children.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Security </strong><br>
  <br>
  The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow  generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted  to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of  transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%  secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable  means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute  security, and therefore you transmit information to us at your own risk. Once  we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its security  on our systems. Access to this personal information is strictly limited, and  not accessible to the public. All of our users’ personal information is  restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a  specific job are granted access to personal information. Our employees are dedicated  to ensuring the security and privacy of all PredictoMobile™ user personal  information. Employees not adhering to our written firm policies are subject to  disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we  will notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies if we learn of an  information security breach of your Personal Identifiable Information. Please be advised that notice may be  delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope  of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.<br>
  <br>
  If you have any questions about the security practices of the Website, you  can email us at cs_support@PredictoMobile.com.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Business Transitions </strong><br>
  <br>
  If we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by  another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personally  Identifiable Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will  be notified of any such change in ownership or control of your Personal  Identifiable Information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement</strong><br>
  <br>
  We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please  review it frequently. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post  those changes to this Privacy Policy, and provide notice via email, on the  Website homepage and/or other means that we deem appropriate so that you are  aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what  circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Your continued use of the Website and/or  Service following notice of changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your  acceptance of any changes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Contacting Us About Privacy Questions or Concerns</strong><br>
  <br>
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the Service,  Sweepstakes, Surveys or the Website, you may obtain support at any time through  the Website at www.predictomobile.com/support, via email at  cs_support@PredictoMobile.com, or via telephone at 800-360-0518.
