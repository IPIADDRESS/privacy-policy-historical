			<h2>3. Registration</h2>

			<p>You are able to navigate through the Website without going through the registration process but we require you to complete the on-line registration form to become a registered member before an order can be made through the Website.</p>

                        <p>4.1 To place an order, you should select the required item(s) and add to your basket by clicking on the 'Buy this product' link.

It is your responsibility to notify us if any of the information is incorrect.  Giving false information may result in the rejection of the order.</p>
			<p>4.3	Each order constitutes a separate transaction and we are not able to consolidate separate transactions into a single order or delivery. If you would like to order multiple items for delivery at the same time, you must ensure that all of these appear on the same order before you confirm your order.</p>

Payment by card will be processed through the electronic payment terminal of HSBC.

				<li>your postal address;</li>
				<li>your mobile telephone number;</li>

			</ul>

			<h2>How we may store and use your information</h2>

			<p>We (or third party data processors acting on our behalf, such as Chillifish Limited) may collect, store and use your personal information listed above for the following purposes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>to register you with our Website, make the Website available to you and to administer the Website;</li>

					<li>to enable us to process and deliver your order for an item;</li>
					<li>for assessment and analysis purposes, for example, customer and product analysis, to enable us to review, develop and improve our services; and/or</li>
					<li>where you have given us your consent, to contact you (including by SMS and e-mail) with products and services which we think may interest you.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>Please note that the personal information you give us in relation to an on-line sale is obligatory, necessary for recording and processing the delivery of your order, as well as for the billing team.  You have the right to access, modify or correct the information given.  To exert this right, you should contact our Customer Service team.</p>

			<p>We will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive marketing information by e-mail from us and we will only send it to you if you do opt in or if you are an existing customer and the information relates to similar items or services to those which you have previously purchased from us.  When we send you communications by e-mail, we will give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such communications from us.   It is not our normal practice to send out marketing communications by post or telephone but if we do, you will be able to opt out of receiving such communications from us.  However, remember if you opt out of receiving communications from us, particularly by email, that this will preclude you from receiving our special offers or promotions in future.</p>
			<p>We will not disclose, sell or rent your personal information to any third party unless you have consented to this. 
If you do consent to receive marketing information from us or carefully selected third parties but later change your mind, you may contact us by email at any time at customercare@prettygreen.com and we will cease any such activity.</p>
			<p>If a third party acquires all (or substantially all) of our business and/or assets, we may disclose your personal information to that third party in connection with the acquisition. We may also disclose your personal information where we are required to do so by applicable law, by a governmental body or by a law enforcement agency.</p>
			<p>Finally, we may also collect anonymised details about users of our Website for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes.  Certain pages of the Website can sometimes contain electronic images or statistics trackers, which make it possible to count the number of visitors to the page. This can be used with certain partners in order to measure and improve the effectiveness of certain adverts. The information obtained is anonymous and simply makes it possible to gather statistics on the frequency of use of certain pages of the Website.  No single individual will be identifiable from the anonymised details we collect for these purposes.</p>
