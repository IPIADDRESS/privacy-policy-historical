</ol>
</ol><p><strong>4.2 Product Collected Data</strong></p>
<ol class="withalpha">
<li><strong>What it comprises</strong></li>
<p>The Prevx Products, when running on your computer(s), collect information on an anonymous basis from your computers as part of the proper functioning of our Products ("<strong>Product Collected Data</strong>"), and send this information over the internet to servers and databases operated by Prevx (the Prevx Community Database) for use in connection with the anti-malware and other security features provided of our Products. This information includes information concerning the software running on and internet connectivity of the user's computer, such as data about programs scanned, website URLs checked, and threats and attempted intrusion events detected. This has been designed with data protection in mind, and so does not collect any personally identifying or transaction related information. If Prevx links any Product Collected Data to your personal name we will treat it as Personal Data. Please note, we don't upload any of your data files and software programs on your computer without your consent; our software creates a special cryptographically secure hash value from the file or program being inspected and compares this value with our online database to verify whether the program or file is a known good or bad program or file within our anti-malware database; but we may ask you to upload a suspicious file or program we have not identified before for analysis.</p>
<li><strong>How we collect it</strong></li>
<p>The Product Collected Data is collected automatically by the Prevx software, for instance when it runs a scan on your computer or you visit a web-page.</p>
<li><strong>What we use it for</strong></li>
<ol class="withroman">
<li><strong>Provide Product</strong></li>
<p>We use such Product Collected Data to provide our Product to you. Our Product sends to our remote servers and databases (where it is retained) details of the files and software on your computer for purposes of checking whether that file or software is known or suspected malware against our database, and examining that software where it is suspected, and keeping a record of the status of your computer so as to identify any new previously unseen software that tries to run. Our Product also sends details of visited website URLs to our database to verify the legitimacy of the URLs.</p>
<li><strong>Improve our Database</strong></li>
<p>We also use the software, URL and threat information we obtain from your computer to improve the performance of our databases and systems, to provide additional statistical information which is used in the verification of software, files and websites. The Product Collected Data is aggregated into our community database and used to make determinations on good and bad programs.</p>
<li><strong>Statistics</strong></li>
<p>We use the Product Collected Data to produce general statistics on attacks, threats, their propagation and overall measures of the level of internet abuse and crime. These statistics may be used by us in our malware research, publicity, marketing and promotional materials. We use the Product Collected Data for analyzing and publishing overall threat activity on the internet, researching threats, compiling statistics and to further refine and improve the performance of the Prevx Products.</p>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong></li>
<p>We may also use the Product Collected Data to carry out analysis and research in relation to our overall Product performance and in relation malware and dangerous websites, and to facilitate reviews, developments and improvements of our Products.</p>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><strong>4.3 Click-Stream Data</strong></p>
<ol class="withalpha">
<li><strong>What it comprises</strong></li>
<p>This data comprises tracking of your use of our Website (including purchases you make and registrations), including for example which pages you view and which links you use. This information about your use of this Site is called "click-stream data." Click-stream data does not identify you personally. If Prevx links any click-stream data to your personal name we will treat it as Personal Data.</p>
<li><strong>How we collect it</strong></li>
<p>We use technology running on our Website server computers to monitor and capture click-stream data.</p>
<li><strong>What we use it for</strong></li>
<p>Click-stream data is used to analyse the performance of our Website, to improve our Website, to help us determine what is important to you, and what is not, to help us decide what content and features to add and what to discard, and to help us determine whether our Website is easy to use or whether we need to redesign certain pages and links.  </p>
</ol><p><strong>4.4 Cookies</strong></p>
<ol class="withalpha">
<li><strong>What they comprise</strong></li>
<p>We may finally obtain information about you by installing our own markers on your computer. These markers are commonly called "cookies", and are small pieces of information that are transferred from our website to and stored by your browser in a small text file on your computer. Their use is very common by many online services. They enable us to know you by a computer-generated, unique identifier, and are used to store and track information about Website usage and to remember you and your settings when you next visit. </p>
<li><strong>What we use them for</strong></li>
<p>We may use cookies in two ways:-</p>
<ol class="withroman"><li><strong>per-session cookies</strong> are used while you are logged on to our Website to record temporary data relating to your visit to our Website, to manage the delivery of web pages to you and any registration and ordering processes, and to help us monitor traffic through the Website;</li>
<li><strong>logon and usage cookies</strong> store some data between visits to our Website in order to allow you to log on to your account more easily, and using them we are able to personalise your experience, and create a database of your previous choices and preferences, and in situations where those choices or preferences need to be collected again, they can be supplied by us automatically, saving you time and effort. For example, after you purchase a product once, if you need to purchase it again your previous selection of options will be retained and can be re-entered more quickly.</li>
</ol><li><strong>De-activating Cookies</strong></li>
<p>If you do not want to use "cookies" most Internet browsers programs will permit you to turn them off. Should you do this, you will still be able to access most of our Website as normal, but some processes that depend on cookies may not work properly. Your computer may be specially configured to reject cookies: please refer to your browser for more information.</p>
</ol><li><a name="Third"></a>Disclosure of Customer Data To Third Parties</li>
<p><strong>5.1 Purposes of disclosure and recipients</strong></p>

<p>We may share Customer Data with third parties for use by those third parties to market their products and services to you.

<li><strong>Payment Processing</strong></li>
<p>Your Customer Data may be processed by third parties who provide order processing services to us, and we may transfer Customer Data to third party payment processors in order to process payments for orders (such as credit and debit card processing companies). If we use a third party order processing service, they will collect and send your data to us securely, which will then be incorporated into our databases. </p>
<li><strong>Prevx Contractors</strong></li>
<p>We may have your Customer Data processed by third-parties throughout the world who act for or on behalf of Prevx; for example, we may use cloud computing or remote database hosting services which may be located anywhere in the world, and we may engage contractors anywhere in the world for the purposes of providing support or back-office services to us, including website hosting, order processing, order fulfilment, application and database hosting, data processing services, or that help us market our products and services. These companies will process and hold information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information they process for us for any other purpose than those to which we have notified you under this Privacy Policy.   </p>
<li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong></li>
<p>We may share or transfer your Customer Data to a government authority where required to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, or where reasonably required to protect your or your company's vital interests.</p>
<li><strong>Corporate Transfer</strong></li>
<p>We may transfer your Customer Data to any company that purchases or otherwise acquires our business in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event.</p>

</ol><p><strong>5.2 Data Protection Act Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Before disclosing any Personal Data to a third party, Prevx will contractually require the third party to take adequate precautions to protect that Personal Data against unauthorized use or disclosure and to process it only in accordance with our instructions or for the purposes for which it was disclosed. If we have any Personal Data processed outside the European Union, we will comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 and all other applicable data protection laws within the European Union in connection with such processing.</p>
<li><a name="Security"></a>Data Integrity and Security</li>
<p>Prevx will take commercially reasonable measures to maintain the integrity and security of Customer Data. We keep Customer Data only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal reporting or document retention requirements. Our servers and our databases are protected by industry standard security technology, such as industry standard firewalls and password protection. Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of data, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.</p>
