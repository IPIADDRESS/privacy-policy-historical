</p><h2>PJRC's Privacy Policy</h2>

A quick summary of our privacy policy is:
<ol>
<li>We will use your personal information only for the 
purpose you provided it to us.
</li><li>We never sell or share personally identifying information
with others for marketing/advertising purposes.
</li><li>We won't send you "spam" email !!
</li></ol>

We are concerned about your personal privacy, and we
are concerned about acting responsibly with the personal
information you may send to us.
<p>
Many internet privacy policy pages consist of little more than
a small set of nice-sounding but unrealistic promises.
For example, "we never give your information to <i>anybody</i>."
Nice as that sounds, how could such a company ship a package
to you if they don't give your address to the shipping
carrier?  The remainder of this lengthy page attempts to
document, as thoughly as reasonably possible, exaclty how
we may collect information about you and your activites, how
we will use
this infomation, when and how it may be disclosed to
others, and what steps we take to protect your
private information.

</p><h3>What Information Is Collected</h3>

As you browse most of PJRC.COM, our web server collects
only standard web server access logs (IP number, date/time,
page accessed, referrer and browser strings, etc).  We
do not use session tracking techniques, except as
necessary for the on-line ordering pages (see
"Use Of HTTP Cookies" below).
<p>
The PJRC on-line store collects private information about
you, including your name, billing and shipping address,
email, phone number, the items you want to purchase,
and details about your payment.
</p><p>
Some portions of PJRC.COM feature mail lists, which allow
you to be notified when significant changes are made to
that portion of the site.  Only your email address is
collected.
</p><p>
A chat system and the gift exchange portion of
the site require creating an account, where your name,
email, and address are collected.  Messages exchanged in
the chat system are not stored or logged by our server.
A public message board
allows public messages to be posted, and
posting a message requires the collection of your name
and the message.
</p><p>
From time to time we receive comments, suggestions, or
submissions (usually by email) of material to add to the
web site.

</p><h3>How This Information Is Used</h3>

Web server access logs are used to compile statistics
regarding relative popularity and bandwidth usages of
individual pages and other files.  These logs are also
used to compile a list of sites that link to PJRC.  From
time to time, we analyze these logs to detect usage
patterns of the site and look for potential problems.
<p>
Data collected by the on-line ordering pages is used to
collect payment for the items ordered and to ship the
package to you.  Your contact information is used to
inform you of our progress in processing your order.
In some circumstances, we may use your contact information
in the future (see "Unsolicited Contact" below).  We also
use this data to compile common business statistics that
do not include any personally identifying information
about you, such as financial statements.
</p><p>
Email addresses for notification of changes to the site
are only used to send email messages when significant
changes are made.  These notices are only sent when
very significant changes or very substantial new material
is made available.
</p><p>
Personal information associated with the gift exchange
is used according to the guidelines explained on those
pages.  It is not anticipated that PJRC will host future
gift exchanges, and it is likely that all gift exchange
data will be deleted at some point in the future.
</p><p>
When we receive suggestions or submissions of material
to add to the site, it is often posted to a web page,
as appropriate on a case by case basis.

</p><h3>Disclosure To Third Parties</h3>

We will not disclose personal information about you to any third
parties, except as is necessary to complete the tasks
for which you provided the information, and in those
cases only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.
<p>
In general, we do not disclose our web server stats, but
we do not consider this information confidential and in
some cases we will share private summary pages with
interested parties.  We do not share the "raw" server
logs, which contain lists of IP numbers.
</p><p>
While processing your order placed in our on-line store,
we must disclose some of your personal information to
our bank for Visa and Master Card payment, to Western
Union if they are used to send a money transfer, or
to your bank if you send a personal check.  In each case,
we will only disclose the information necessary to
process your payment.  We must
also disclose your name and address to UPS or the US
Postal Service in order to ship your package.  For
shippment outside the US, we must disclose your phone
number to UPS, which allows them to contact you in the
event the package is delayed in customs.  Every package
we ship has a packing list or "commercial invoice" in a
clear plastic envelop on the outside of the package.
The side visible through the plastic shows only your
name and billing address.  Inside, the packing list or commercial
invoice shows details of your order, including the items,
their prices, your payment method, and your phone
number for an international order (needed for customs).
The packing list or commercial invoice does not show your
email address or credit card number.  We will not disclose
your personal on-line order information to any third
parties other than is necessary to process the order.
</p><p>
In the case of a fraudlent order placed in the on-line
store, we may disclose the information we received
to any parties involved (banks, credit card
processing company, legitimate card holder) and to law
enforcement officers or any other party involved in an
investigation of the fraud.
</p><p>
From time to time, we may compile statistics regarding
on-line orders, such as a financial statement or a chart
showing countries
where packages were shipped.  In cases where these stats
provide no personally identifying information, we may
disclose them to third parties.  
</p><p>
We never disclose the lists of email addresses collected for
notification of changes to portions of the web site.
</p><p>
Information collected by the gift exhange is disclosed to
your "buddy", who will need it to send you a gift.  At the
closing of the exchage, a list of who was paired with whom
is published, but only with the "handles".  Messages sent
in the chat system are transmitted to all other users
current logged into the chat area, and messages posted to
the public message board are obviously displayed to anyone
who reads the message board.
</p><p>
Material or suggestions we receive for the site itself is
usually posted to the appropriate public web page.  We usually
disclose your name, to give you credit for your contribution,
but not your email address.  If you specifically request to
remain anonymous, we won't disclose your name, and if you wish
your email adress to appear, we'll post it as you request (many
people request some translation to avoid spammers harvesting
their email address).

</p><h3>Unsolicited Contact</h3>

We hate unsolicited commercial email (spam), and we never
want to send you a message that would cause you to associate
us with the common spam, such as "get rich quick" schemes,
aging reversal pills, questionable mortgage and debt consolidation,
etc.  In general, we will not send you email messages to
announce new products, sales or promotions just because you
have previously placed an order.  It is our assumption
that you will sign an announcement mailing list if you want
to be informed of changes and new material.
<p>
In some cases, we may contact you if there is a compelling
need.  For example, if a significant firmware bug is discovered
and we believe you may have a product that contains that code,
we would send you a message to advise you of the potential problem
and provide instructions on how to upgrade.  From time to time,
we receive a request for a referal of someone who purchased a
product, and in such a case we may forward their request to you
(we'd never send them your email address, of course).
</p><p>
If you have submitted material to us that appears somewhere on
the web site, we may forward questions we receive.
Again, we will not disclose your email address, so it would
be up to you to choose if you want to respond directly, or have
us route your response, or not respond at all.
</p><p>
It is impossible
to predict all of the possible circumstances that may compel
us to contact you, but we will use our best judgement and we
will in general avoid sending any unsolicited messages.

</p><h3>Consent and Choice (Opt Out)</h3>

We only use your personal information for the specific
purpose that it was provided, and it is only disclosed to
the extent that is necessary.  There is no additional
disclosure, which is the subject of traditional "Opt-Out".
Still, if you would like us to remove your information
from our records, please contact us by email.  If you have
placed an order using the store, we must retain a printed
copy of your order for our financial records.

<h3>Use Of HTTP "Cookies"</h3>

Our on-line store pages track your order with a cookie.
If cookies are disabled in your browers <i>preferences</i>
or <i>options</i>, you will only be able to add a single
item to your order... all attempts to add a second item
will cause the first to be lost.  You also will not be
able to proceed to Step 2 or Step 3.  The on-line store
pages are the only portion of PJRC.COM that requires
the use of cookies.  (<b>Update, December 2001</b>: Bugzilla uses
a cookie, and the soon-to-be-added forum pages will probably
also use a cookie to avoid having to retype passwords).
<p>
The information stored in this on-line ordering cookie is limited to a pair
of index numbers, so that our server will be able to look up
which order is yours, and an automatically generated password
number, which prevents someone else from viewing and changing
your order (if they were to manually reprogram their cookie data).
None of your personal data is sent or stored using cookies.
All of these ordering pages and the information contained in
them, including the cookie, are transfered
using secure SSL encrypted communication.
</p><p>
PJRC.COM contains no banner ads or images from other
companies or organizations, who typically use cookies to track
users' browsing habits.  Our site doesn't use session ID
strings or cookies to track your usages of the site, other
than your session in the on-line ordering section.


</p><h3>Data Quality And Access</h3>

If you believe there may be an error in any information
we have regarding you, please feel free to contact us
by email.

<h3>Security</h3>

Our on-line ordering web pages use SSL encryption to protect
your personal infomation, including your credit card number,
while it is in transit to our server.  SSL does two things to
protect you.  First, it encrypts all communication in both
directions, so that a third party can not intercept it.  Second,
it verifies PJRC's certificate (digitally signed by
<a href="http://www.thawte.com/">Thawte</a>), which verifies
that your communication is being sent directly to PJRC.
<p>
On-line order information is stored in a database that is
protected by a firewall, passwords, and network access
restrictions to our local LAN.  We routinely delete electronic
copies of credit card numbers after orders are processed.

</p><h3>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>

As we add new features to PJRC.COM or make changes in the
way we process orders, it may be necessary to modify this
privacy policy.  Changes will be consistant with our
overall goals to respect your privacy and avoid
disclosure of your private data for any purpose other than
that for which you originally provided it.  We hate spam
do not intend to modify this policy to permit sending
unsolicited commercial email.  We are concerned about
protecting your privacy.  If you have any questions or
concerns about this privacy policy or how we handle your
private information, please contact us by email.
