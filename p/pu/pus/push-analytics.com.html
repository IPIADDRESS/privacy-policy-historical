                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary, Ripe may disclose
                                  any information you provide if required to do so by law or pursuant to a
                                  request by law enforcement or if Ripe has a good faith belief that
                                  disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with the legal
                                  process; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Ripe or third

                                  information may be one of the transferred assets in which case Ripe reserves
