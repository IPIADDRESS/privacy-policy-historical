                        <p>PushAlert is an India-based, global company. We primarily store your information in the United States. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which PushAlert has operations for the purposes described in this Policy.</p>
                        <p>If you are accessing or using our Websites or Services or otherwise providing information to us, you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal information to the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="terms-h3">7. Data Subject Rights</h3>
                        <p><b>Attendees, Website Visitors, and Customers</b>: You have the right to access, correct, update, export, or delete your personal information. You may email us at support@pushalert.co with any such subject access requests ("SAR"), and we will respond within thirty (30) days. Customers also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their profile or organization record at PushAlert.co.</p>
                        <p><b>End Users</b>: You have the right to access, correct, update, export, or delete your personal information. You can delete your information stored with us by unsubscribing from notifications by following the instructions <a href="https://pushalert.co/documentation/delete-your-data" target="_blank">here</a>. PushAlert automatically removes expired endpoints and associated data. You may also email us at support@pushalert.co with any such subject access requests ("SAR") with your Subscription Key (<a href="https://pushalert.co/documentation/extract-subscription-key" target="_blank">How to get subscription key?</a>), and we will respond within thirty (30) days. In case our Customers receive a SAR from an end-user regarding our service, PushAlert will unequivocally comply with the request.</p>
                        <p>For any SAR, we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about their own information before we can assist. Where a SAR may implicate the personal data of another individual, we must balance the request against the risk of violating another person’s privacy rights. We will comply with SARs to the extent required by applicable law. In the EU, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>

                        <h3 class="terms-h3">8. Data Portability</h3>
                            <p>We strive for data portability. You can export all the endpoints and associated data required for web push and move to a different service pursuant to the conditions mentioned below. If you require data portability please make sure you use your own FCM/GCM configuration, while registering for PushAlert or while adding a new website to your PushAlert account and also use your own HTTPS domain/subdomain.</p>
                            <p><b>Technical Limitations:</b></p>
                            <p>If you use HTTP integration method then the subscriptions are bound to a PushAlert subdomain, so you cannot move this subscription data to a different service due to technical limitations. Similarly, if you use the HTTPS method of integration but do not use your own FCM/GCM configuration, your subscriptions will be tied to PushAlert, and you cannot move this subscription data to a different service. Additional technical limitations apply to Safari desktop and to legacy products.</p>
                            <p>You can request for a data export by reaching out to <a href="mailto:support@pushalert.co">support@pushalert.co</a>.</p>

                            <h3 class="terms-h3">9. Data Retention</h3>
                            <p>We retain your personal information to provide services to you and as otherwise necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We will retain your personal information for no more 90 days following the date on which you terminate your use of the Services, unless we are otherwise required by law or regulation to retain your personal information for longer.</p>
