  <p>
  Superblock, LLC ("Superblock", "we", "us", "our") provides online and mobile
  services, including but not limited to, the Pushover website ("Pushover.net"
  or the "Site"), API, and mobile applications (collectively, the "Service").
  Superblock is committed to maintaining the privacy, integrity and security of
  any personal information about our users.

  include information that identifies your current Pushover application
  version, your device operating system version, your device hardware
  manufacturer and model number, and your Pushover device client license
  status.  No personally-identifiable information (such as a device-specific
  "UUID") is sent with these requests.
