  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>
  Superblock, LLC ("Superblock", "we", "us", "our") provides online and mobile
  services, including but not limited to, the Pushover website ("Pushover.net"
  or the "Site"), API, and mobile applications (collectively, the "Service").
  Superblock is committed to maintaining the privacy, integrity and security of
  any personal information about our users.
  </p>
  <p>
  This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how we protect personal information
  we collect in connection with your use of the Service and how we use and in
  some cases disclose that information. "Personal information" for purposes of
  this Policy means information that identifies you, such as your name or
  e-mail address.  This Policy is subject to the provisions our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, which are incorporated by reference.
  </p>

  <p>
  </p><h3>What Personal Information We Collect</h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>
  Your Pushover service works in conjunction with a user account on
  Pushover.net (a "User Account").  When you sign up for a Pushover User
  Account from our mobile applications or our Site, you are required to provide
  an e-mail address (which will be used as your login ID) and to create an
  account password (collectively the "Registration Information").
  </p>

  <p>
  During the course of using your Pushover Service, the Pushover device client
  applications will routinely synchronize your notification data with Pushover
  servers.  These requests sent from your Pushover device client application
  include information that identifies your current Pushover application
  version, your device operating system version, your device hardware
  manufacturer and model number, and your Pushover device client license
  status.  No personally-identifiable information (such as a device-specific
  "UUID") is sent with these requests.
  </p>

  <p>
  </p><h3>How We Use Your Personal Information</h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>
  Superblock uses your personal information to:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Provide you with the Service;</li>
  <li>Analyze Site usage and improve the Service;</li>
  <li>Deliver to you any administrative notices and communications relevant
  to your use of the Pushover Service;</li>
  <li>Provide you with updates regarding Superblock and Pushover products
    and services;</li>
  <li>Perform internal market research, project planning, troubleshooting
    problems, and to detect and protect against error, fraud or other criminal
    activity; and</li>
  <li>Enforce the Pushover <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  </p><h3>Disclosure to Third Parties</h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>
  Superblock ("we") collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with
  us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit,
  and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information
  and/or site registrations).  The information we collect is exclusively used
  to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, and
  is not shared with or sold to any person, company, or organization (for the
  avoidance of doubt, this prohibition applies to any commercial and
  non-commercial purposes), except under the following circumstances:
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li><p>

  take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
  involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations
  of <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>, or as otherwise required by law.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>We transfer information about you if Pushover or Superblock, LLC is
  acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Superblock will
  notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to
  a different privacy policy.</p></li>
  </ul>

  "sub-processors" under EU GDPR:

  processed with an off-site fully PCI-compliant third party vendor.
  </p>

  <p>

  into your Pushover account, visiting the Settings header, then clicking on

  </p>
  <p>
  When you request cancellation of your account, your personally identifiable
  information will be marked for deletion including but not limited your e-mail
  address, name, user token, device identifiers, and any messages delivered to
  your devices that have not yet been deleted from our servers.  This data will
  be permanently deleted from our database after 30 days.  Archival copies of
  your account information that exist within our back-up system will be deleted
  in accordance with our normal back-up expiration schedule.

  Superblock may update this policy.  We will notify you about significant
