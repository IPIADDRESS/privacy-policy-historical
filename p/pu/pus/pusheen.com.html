				<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Last Updated: March 29, 2019</p>
<p>Pusheen Corp. (“Pusheen”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting your information and privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide to us in connection with your access to and use of our website (www.pusheen.com), and the store and services made available at or through the website (collectively, the “Services”), and informs you about our practices concerning your information. If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at http://pusheen.zendesk.com</p>
<p>Your use of our Services is also subject to the terms of our Terms of Service. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>If you reside in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, please see Section 8 below titled “Supplemental Notice to EU Data Subjects.”</p>
<p><strong>SECTION 1 – Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>1.1 Personal Information. The term “Personal Information” means information relating to a living person who is or can be identified from that information or from that information in conjunction with other information that is in, or comes into, our possession.</p>
<p>1.2 Cart and Billing Information. When you purchase something from our Services, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the Personal Information you give us such as your name, address, email address, and billing address (“Billing Information”). In the event that you reach the checkout and fill out your Personal Information but decide to abandon your cart, your cart and Personal Information will still be stored in our system as an abandoned cart (collectively, “Abandoned Cart Information”). Abandoned Cart Information can be deleted at your request at any time. We may also send you an automated e-mail within 24 hours of abandoning your cart to remind you to complete your purchase.</p>
<p>1.3 Usage Information. When you browse our Services, we also automatically receive information, which may include Personal Information, regarding your access to and use of our Services. This information includes your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address, in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser type, operating system, device type, language, referring website URLs, log files, pages on our website that you visit and links that you click on (collectively, “Usage Information”).</p>
<p>1.4 Payment Information. Our store is hosted by Shopify Inc. Shopify provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. When you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Shopify stores your purchase transaction data only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After your purchase transaction is complete, Shopify deletes your purchase transaction data. All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers. For more insight, you may also want to read Shopify’s Terms of Service here or Privacy Policy here.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION 2 – Use of Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>2.1 Transaction and Billing. We use information you submit, including Personal Information, to process your transactions. We utilize Shopify applications to detect fraud, verify your credit card, provide shipping rates, prevent purchases in excess of applicable limits, process, ship and complete purchase orders.</p>
<p>2.2. Customer Service and Technical Support. We may contact you using the information you provide in order to respond to inquiries you send us, to communicate with you regarding our Services (e.g., updates about our store, including new products),<br>
and to market our Services to you. If you do not wish to receive such emails, you can choose to opt-out of receipt using the unsubscribe link within each email. We utilize Shopify applications for these purposes and to assist customers with exchanges and returns. You may also opt-in to receive email notifications when products are back in stock.</p>
<p>2.3 Operation and Improvement of our Services. We use your information, including Personal Information, to operate our business and provide the Services to you. We use information to personalize the Services we provide to you. We may use your information to verify your identity, for fraud prevention, to enforce the Terms of Service, and to protect the integrity of our Services. We may also use your information to develop new Services and to improve the quality of our Services.</p>
<p>2.4 Upon Consent. Before we use your Personal Information for a purpose other than identified in this Privacy Policy, we will either ask you directly for your consent to such use or provide you with an opportunity to say no to us using your Personal Information for a secondary reason. If you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at support@heychickadee.com.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION 3 – Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>
