<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may contract with companies or persons to provide certain
services including credit card processing, shipping, data
management, collections processing, promotional services, etc. We
call these our Service Providers. We provide our Service Providers
with the information needed for them to perform these services. We

seek to cause injury to you, Pull-A-Part, LLC, or others. We will
disclose your personally identifiable information when required to

necessary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While rare, from time to time we might establish a business
relationship with other persons or entities that we believe
trustworthy. These are known as our Marketing Partners. In such
cases we might share and cross-reference information, including
some information about you, to enable such persons or entities to
contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest
to you. We only share the information we believe is appropriate to
enable the Marketing Partners to carry out their responsibilities
under our contracts, and we require that the information be used
only for the specifically authorized purpose and that its
confidentiality be maintained.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may share aggregated demographic information about our user
