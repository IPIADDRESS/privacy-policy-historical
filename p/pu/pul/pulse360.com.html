	<p class="sectionParagraph">"Cookies" are small data files that are sent to your browser and are stored on your hard drive, keeping track of your general activity on a site. When you make subsequent visits to a web site on our Advertising Network, your cookie gives us a summary of your preferences and past experiences on the site. This allows us to tailor Pulse 360 services on our Advertising Network. Your cookie may be altered at different times throughout your visits to web sites in our Advertising Network, and it is updated frequently as you encounter various Pulse 360 features and services on sites in our Advertising Network.
	</p>
	<p class="sectionParagraph">Pixel tags (also known as "action tags," or "web beacons") are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a site and which allow the operator of the site, or a third party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read, and modify cookies on, and to transfer other data to, the browser used to view the site. Pixel tags may also be used to obtain information about the computer being used to view that site. The entity that sends the tag can view the IP address of the computer that the tag is sent to, the time it was sent, the user's operating system and browser type, and similar information. We use pixel tags on our Advertising Network.
	</p>
	<p class="sectionParagraph">Every time you use a site on our Advertising Network, our server may deliver certain customized information to you based on the data stored in your cookie.

Check your browser's "Help" files or other similar resources to learn more about handling cookies on your browser.

	<p class="sectionParagraph">"Clickstream data" is a trail of electronic information that is left at each web site you visit. This information can be collected and stored by a site's server.
