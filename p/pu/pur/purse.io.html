(“PurseIO”, “we”, “our” or “us”) with respect to your access and use of the PurseIO website located at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.purse.io">www.purse.io</a>&nbsp;(the “Site”) and PurseIO’s products and services (collectively, the “Service”), so that you can make an informed decision about using the Service.</p><p>We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personally identifiable information you provide to us or collected about you will be used.</p><h3>What Is Personally Identifiable Information?</h3><p>As used in this Policy, the term “personally identifiable information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, user name or email address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to information that specifically identifies an individual. Personally identifiable information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifiable information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p><h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3><p>Active Collection: We collect information from you in various ways when you use the Service. For example, we collect information: (i) that you voluntarily provide to us (such as when you send us an email or create a PurseIO account); and (ii) to which you provide us access. Such information may include personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, social network data, other account data, and financial information. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with posting data, providing access to your online groups and other activities in connection with the Service.</p><p>Passive Collection: When you use the Service, some information is also automatically collected. For example, we may automatically collect certain information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifier (UDID), your mobile number, your device model and name, your operating system, your browser type, your preferred language, and your activity on the Service. We may also automatically collect certain logistical information in server logs, including information about how you use various features of our service and information about the number, frequency and length of each session. We treat this information as personally identifiable information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, this information is used in the aggregate only.</p><p>We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies” when you use the Service. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. Among other things, cookies help us to improve the Service and your experience. If we link cookies to any personally identifiable information, we will treat this information as personally identifiable information. If you wish to block, erase or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services made available via the Service.</p><p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, or Service Providers (as defined below) is not covered by this Policy.</p><p>We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Service. We may link the information gathered by clear gifs to your personally identifiable information. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Service, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</p><p>Personally identifiable information will be stored on secured servers, and we may store and process personally identifiable information in the United States and other countries.</p><h3>How Do We Use the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect?</h3><p>We use personally identifiable information collected through the Service for the purposes described in this Policy or elsewhere on the Service.

For example, we may share personally identifiable information as follows:</p><ul class="left-padding-20"><li><p>with vendors, consultants, and other service providers (such as a credit card processing company to bill you for the Service and an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf) (“Service Providers”) who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Service and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us;</p></li><li><p>when you give us your consent to do so, including if we notify you on the Service that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information;</p></li><li><p>in an aggregated or anonymized form that does not directly identify you;</p></li><li><p>when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessaryropriate to comply with the law or legal processes or to respond to lawful requests or legal authorities including, but not limited to, responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants or court orders;</p></li><li><p>when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessaryropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of PurseIO, our users, our employees, copyright owners, third-parties or the public including, but not limited to, protecting PurseIO or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate, or unlawful use of the Service;</p></li><li><p>to enforcely this Policy, the Terms of Service, or our other policies or agreements; and</p></li><li><p>in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation where personally identifiable information may be disclosed or transferred as one of the business assets of PurseIO.</p></li></ul><p>You acknowledge and agree that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed or transferred as one of the business assets of PurseIO.</p><p>You understand that when you use the Service, information you provide via the Service, information you grant access to by using the Service, as well as any information you share with individuals through the Service, will be available to other users and in some cases may be made publicly available.</p><p>We are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third-parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to any other users or third-parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with third-party privacy practices before disclosing information directly to any such third-parties.
