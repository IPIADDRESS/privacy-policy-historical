              <p class="Contenttext">At Purolator, we are committed to protecting our customers’  privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform our customers of Purolator's  practices relating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal  information that we may receive in association with our customers’ use of our  shipping and related products and services, our customers’ access to or use of  our websites, or other interactions our customers may have with us.</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Meaning of “Customer” and “Personal Information”</strong> <br>
              For the purposes  of this Privacy Statement,</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><br>
  “customer” refers  to anyone who uses Purolator’s products and services, whether as the shipper,  receiver, arranger of the shipment or otherwise, and anyone who uses  Purolator’s websites, and</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><br>
  "personal information" means information about an  identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title or business  address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>What Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It <br>
              </strong>We collect personal information  about every shipment tendered to Purolator so that we can provide our customers  with the transportation and information services necessary to make shipping  convenient, and bill our customers accurately for the products and services we  provide to them. &nbsp;Examples of the personal  information we collect in relation to shipments include: </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="Contenttext">contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and personal  telephone number); </li>
                <li class="Contenttext">proof of identity (such as signature and government-issued photo  identification); and</li>
                <li class="Contenttext">financial and billing information (such as credit card details and  credit history).</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="Contenttext">We use the personal  information we collect in relation to shipments so that we can: </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="Contenttext">provide our customers with timely and reliable products and services,  including the pick-up and delivery of shipments, the performance of logistics  services, the arrangement of customs brokerage services, and communication with  our customers about the status of their shipments (including through our online  shipment tracking application, by telephone or by e-mail); </li>
                <li class="Contenttext">bill our customers for the products and services we provide them,  including the verification of their credit, the authentication of their  identities, and the production of detailed invoices that help them verify the  charges billed to them;</li>
                <li class="Contenttext">establish, maintain and develop relationships with our customers,  including the management of their accounts with Purolator;</li>
                <li class="Contenttext">develop, promote and manage our products and services, including the  completion of market studies and the communication of new products and services  to our customers; and </li>
                <li class="Contenttext">assist law enforcement agencies, collect debts owed to Purolator, protect  Purolator’s business interests (including enforcing Purolator’s Terms and  Conditions of Service), and generally meet requirements imposed by law. &nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>When We Disclose Personal Information<br>
                          </strong>We  may transfer personal information to third parties engaged to assist us in  providing products and services to our customers or to otherwise carry out one  or more of the purposes described above.&nbsp;  Such third parties may include, among others, other transportation  companies or local pick-up and delivery agents involved in the pick-up,  transportation and delivery of shipments, customs brokers and information  services/technology service providers.&nbsp; When  transferring personal information to third parties, we use contractual or other  means to provide a level of protection comparable to our own level of  protection while the personal information is in the third party’s custody.&nbsp; In addition, we may share personal  information with Purolator’s affiliates for the purpose of facilitating one or  more of the purposes described above.&nbsp; Due  to the location of some of these third parties and affiliates or the location  of their computer servers, personal information is sometimes transferred and held  outside of Canada.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">We  reserve the right to co-operate fully with local, provincial, state and federal  officials in any investigation relating to any personal information (including private  electronic communications transmitted on any Purolator website) or any  purported unlawful activities. We also reserve the right to disclose and/or  transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or  actual direct or indirect sale, merger or other transfer of the assets or  shares of Purolator Courier Ltd. or a division thereof, provided that the third  party agrees to adhere to the principles expressed in this Privacy Statement  and the information does not constitute all or substantially all of the assets  being transferred.&nbsp; <br>
                Except as stated above, we will not,  without our customers’ consent, sell, share, transfer, license, trade or rent personal  information received from them to others.</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>How We Obtain Consent<br>
              </strong>The  form of consent we obtain from an individual, including whether it is express  or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information  and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances. &nbsp;We will not, as a condition of the supply of our  products and services, require any individual to consent to the collection, use  or disclosure of his or her personal information beyond that required to fulfill  the purposes described above or otherwise described at the time consent is  sought. <br>
                </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">When a customer provides us with  personal information relating to an individual other than themselves (such as the  intended recipient of the shipment), we rely on the customer who is providing  us with the personal information to obtain that individual’s consent to our  collection, use and disclosure of their personal information in the  circumstances described above. </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Withdrawing Consent</strong><br>
                Anyone may withdraw consent to  Purolator’s further use, retention or disclosure of their personal information at  any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Consent  may be withdrawn by contacting Purolator at 1-888-280-9557 or <a href="mailto:privacy@purolator.com">privacy@purolator.com</a>.  We will inform the person who is withdrawing his or her consent of the  implications of doing so.</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Cookies</strong> <br>
                A cookie is a small file containing information that a  website creates when you visit it. A cookie can track how and when someone uses  a website and/or other websites which they visited and can store that  information. There are two common types of cookies: "session cookies"  and "persistent cookies". Session cookies store information only for  the length of time that someone is connected to a website -- they are not  written onto the person’s hard drive. Once the person leaves the website, the  originator of the cookie no longer has the information that was contained on  it. We use session cookies as an additional security feature. <br>
                </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">When  our customers log on to our websites and are authenticated through their User  ID and password, a cookie will store the identification number of their browser.  Throughout their session, the session cookie acts as a type of digital  signature to identify our customer’s current session to the web server. The web  server will monitor our customer’s browser number to ensure that, at all times  during the session, we are dealing with our customer. <br>
                </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">We also use session cookies to track  our customers’ visits to our website. &nbsp;We  use that information to determine the type of information that our customers are  looking for on our website and to improve our website. We use information about  the site our customers visited immediately prior to our site to assess the  viability of links to our site that we have created on third party sites. &nbsp;The information stored in "persistent  cookies" is written onto our customer’s hard drive and remains there until  the expiry date of the cookie. &nbsp;From time  to time, we use persistent cookies to store non-sensitive personal information.  Currently, most browsers do not distinguish between session cookies and  persistent cookies. For our websites to operate, our customer’s browser must be  set to accept cookies. If a customer is concerned about having his or her browser  enabled to accept cookies while he or she is surfing other websites, we  recommend that his or her browser be set to notify him or her when it is  receiving a cookie. This gives the customer the ability to accept or reject  cookies presented by the web server he or she is visiting. We suggest contacting  the browser’s programmer on how to do this. </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>How We Protect Personal  Information</strong><br>
                We make all commercially reasonable  efforts to ensure that personal information collected is protected against loss  and unauthorized access. &nbsp;Access to our  customers’ personal information is restricted to selected Purolator employees and  contractors. In addition, we employ generally accepted information security  techniques, such as firewalls, access control procedures and cryptography, to  protect personal information against loss and unauthorized access. &nbsp;While we use commercially reasonable efforts  to limit access to our vehicles and premises to authorized personnel, we cannot  guarantee the confidentiality of information that is displayed on any shipment  package or shipment label. </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Retention of Personal Information</strong> <br>
                We retain our customers’ personal  information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was  collected and to comply with applicable laws. </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Links to Third Party Sites</strong> <br>
                Our website may offer links to other  websites. Customers should be aware that operators of linked websites may also  collect our customers’ personal information (including information generated  through the use of cookies) when they link to those websites. We are not  responsible for how such third parties collect, use or disclose our customers’ personal  information, so it is important for our customers to familiarize themselves with  the privacy policies of such third parties before providing them with personal  information. </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Changes to this Privacy Statement <br>
              </strong>We reserve the right to modify this  Privacy Statement at anytime without notice. The Privacy Statement posted at  any time or from time to time via this website shall be deemed to be the  Privacy Statement then in effect. </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Access</strong> <br>
              Anyone may contact us at  1-888-280-9557 or <a href="mailto:privacy@purolator.com">privacy@purolator.com</a> to request access to or the  correction or update of their personal information.
