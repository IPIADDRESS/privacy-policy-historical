            <p><b>PRIVACY STATEMENT</b> </p>
            <p>At Purolator we are committed to protecting your privacy. The purpose 
              of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about Purolator's practices 
              relating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information 
              that may be provided through access to or use of our websites or 
              shipping services and related products or that may otherwise be 
              collected by us.</p>
            <p><b>Personal Information</b></p>
            <p>For the purpose of this Privacy Statement, "personal information" 
              means information about an identifiable individual, but does not 
              include the name, title or business address or telephone number 
              of an employee of an organization.</p>
            <p><b>What Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It</b></p>
            <p>Purolator collects and retains information about every shipment 
              we make so that we can better provide you with the services and 
              information necessary to make shipping the easiest part of your 
              day.</p>
            <p>Examples of personal information collected by Purolator are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address 
                and telephone number in a non-business capacity);</li>
              <li> proof of identity (such as signature and driver's licence number);</li>
              <li> financial and billing information (such as credit card details 
                and credit history); and</li>
              <li> on an optional basis, demographic information (such as age, 
                education and occupation).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Purolator uses your personal information for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> to provide you with timely and reliable services, including 
                shipping, tracing packages, communicating with you and the intended 
                recipient of your packages about the status of the shipment, customer 
                support, account management and billing, verifying credit, customer 
                authentication and related services;</li>
              <li> to develop and maintain our relationship with you and to communicate 
                with you;</li>
              <li> to develop and improve our products, services and websites 
                and to advise you about new products and services that may be 
                of interest to you;</li>
              <li> to satisfy Purolator's legitimate business interests (for example, 
                conducting market studies and trend analysis and generating aggregate 
                data and reports which record customer behaviour as a whole); 
                and</li>
              <li> to assist law enforcement agencies, to collect outstanding 
                debts, to protect our business interests and the interests of 
                our customers, and to generally meet requirements imposed by law.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>When We Disclose Your Personal Information</b></p>
            <p>Except with your consent, we will not sell, share, license, trade 
              or rent your personal information to others.</p>
            <p>Purolator may disclose personal information to third parties engaged 
              to assist us in providing services to you or to carry out one or 
              more of the purposes described above.</p>
            <p>Purolator reserves the right to co-operate fully with local, provincial, 
              state and federal officials in any investigation relating to any 
              personal information (including private electronic communications 
              transmitted on any Purolator website) or any purported unlawful 
              activities.</p>
            <p>Purolator reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal 
              information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual 
              sale, merger or other transfer of the assets or shares of Purolator 
              Courier Ltd. or a division thereof, provided that the third party 
              agrees to adhere to the principles expressed in this Privacy Statement 
              and the information does not constitute all or substantially all 
              of the assets being transferred.</p>
            <p><b>Knowledge and Consent</b></p>
            <p>Purolator collects personal information about our customers only 
              when our customers voluntarily provide it.</p>
            <p>When personal information is provided to us about the intended 
              recipient of a shipment, we use that information solely for the 
              purposes of processing the shipment and, in some cases, to communicate 
              with the intended recipient to provide information pertaining to 
              the status of the shipment. We rely on our customers to obtain the 
              intended recipient's consent to our use of their personal information 
              for these limited purposes.</p>
            <p>The form of consent provided by an individual, including whether 
              it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity 
              of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of the 
              individual in the circumstances.</p>
            <p>You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual 
              restrictions and reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your 
              consent, please contact Purolator at 1-888-280-9557 or <a href="mailto:privacy@purolator.com">privacy@purolator.com</a>. 
              Purolator will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent.</p>
            <p>We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, 
              require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information 
              beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate 
              purposes.</p>
            <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
            <p>A cookie is a small file containing information that a website 
              creates when you visit it. A cookie can track how and when you use 
              a website and/or other websites which you visited and can store 
              that information.</p>
            <p>There are two common types of cookies: "session cookies" and "persistent 
              cookies".</p>
            <p>Session cookies store information only for the length of time that 
              you are connected to a website -- they are not written onto your 
              hard drive. Once you leave the website, the originator of the cookie 
              no longer has the information that was contained on it.</p>
            <p>Purolator uses session cookies as an additional security feature. 
              When you log on to Purolator Online Shipping and are authenticated 
              through your User ID and password, a cookie will store the identification 
              number of your browser. Throughout your session, the session cookie 
              acts as a type of digital signature to identify your current session 
              to the web server. The web server will monitor the number of your 
              browser to ensure that, at all times during your session, we are 
              dealing with you.</p>
            <p>Purolator also uses session cookies to track your visits within 
              our website. Purolator uses that information to determine the type 
              of information that you are looking for on our website and to improve 
              our website. Purolator uses information about the site you visited 
              immediately prior to our site to assess the viability of links to 
              our site that we have created on third party sites.</p>
            <p>The information stored in "persistent cookies" is written onto 
              your hard drive and remains there until the expiry date of the cookie. 
              From time to time, Purolator uses persistent cookies to store non-sensitive 
              personal information that you are aware of and have agreed to.</p>
            <p>Currently, most browsers do not distinguish between session cookies 
              and persistent cookies. For Purolator Online Shipping to operate, 
              your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you are concerned 
              about having your browser enabled to accept cookies while you are 
              surfing other websites, we recommend that you enable your browser 
              to notify you when it is receiving a cookie. This gives you the 
              ability to accept or reject cookies presented by the web server 
              you are visiting. We suggest you contact the manufacturer of your 
              browser for information on how to do this.</p>
            <p><b>How We Protect Your Personal Information</b></p>
            <p>Purolator makes all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that 
              personal information collected from you is protected against loss 
              and unauthorized access. Access to your personal information is 
              restricted to selected Purolator employees or representatives. In 
              addition, Purolator employs generally accepted information security 
              techniques, such as firewalls, access control procedures and cryptography, 
              to protect personal information against loss and unauthorized access.</p>
            <p>While Purolator uses commercially reasonable efforts to limit access 
              to its vehicles and premises to authorized personnel, Purolator 
              cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information that is displayed 
              on any shipment package or shipment label.</p>
            <p><b>Retention of Your Personal Information</b></p>
            <p>Purolator retains your personal information for as long as necessary 
              to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected and to comply with 
              applicable laws.</p>
            <p><b>Links to Third Party Sites</b></p>
            <p>This website may offer links to other websites. You should be aware 
              that operators of linked websites may also collect your personal 
              information (including information generated through the use of 
              cookies) when you link to their websites. Purolator is not responsible 
              for how such third parties collect, use or disclose your personal 
              information, so it is important to familiarize yourself with their 
              privacy policies before providing them with your personal information.</p>
            <p><b>Changes to this Privacy Statement</b></p>
            <p>Purolator reserves the right to modify this Privacy Statement at 
              anytime without notice. The Privacy Statement posted at any time

              Privacy Statement then in effect.</p>
