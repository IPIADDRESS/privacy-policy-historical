            <b>Privacy Policy</b>
            <p>At Purolator we are committed to protecting your privacy. Purolator 
              collects and retains information about every shipment you tender 
              to us so that we can better provide you with the services and information 
              necessary to make shipping the easiest part of your day. Purolator 
              collects personally identifying information only when you knowingly 
              provide it to us in conjunction with a request for shipping services 
              or a request for information respecting such services. Examples 
              of personally identifying information (i.e. information that can 
              be used to identify you) include such information as your name, 
              employer's name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number 
              and credit card number. </p>
            <p>Purolator will not engage in the business of selling customer lists 
              or personally identifying information to individuals or businesses.</p>
            <p> Purolator may, from time to time, engage third parties to assist 
              us in providing shipping related services to you. Such third parties 
              are restricted from using personally identifying information for 
              any purpose other than assisting us in providing shipping related 
              services to you. </p>
            <p>Purolator collects personally identifying information primarily 
              for the purpose of processing your shipment so as to ensure that 
              we can continue to make shipping the easiest part of your day. </p>
            <p>Purolator may also use the information we collect from you to:</p>

              Any information that you choose to provide to Purolator is intended

            <p>While Purolator uses commercially reasonable efforts to limit access

            <p>Purolator reserves the right to co-operate fully with local, provincial,

            <p>From time to time, Purolator may introduce new services that may 
              require modification of this Privacy Policy. Purolator reserves

              nature (becoming the property of Purolator upon Purolator's receipt

              such comments, suggestions or materials.</p>
            <b>Security</b>
            <p>Purolator takes all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that 
              all information collected from you is protected against loss and 
              unauthorized access. Purolator employs generally accepted information 
              security techniques such as firewalls, access control procedures 
              and cryptography to protect information collected from you against 
              loss and unauthorized access.</p>
            <p>A customer may call any of Purolator's call centres at 1-888-SHIP-123 
              and request that his or her electronic signature for a specific 
              waybill number be removed from our online Proof of Delivery Systems.</p>
            <b>Cookies</b>
            <p>A cookie is a small file containing certain pieces of information 
              that a web site creates when you visit it. A cookie can track how 
              and when you use a web site and/or other web sites which you visited 
              and can store that information. </p>
            <p>There are two common types of cookies, "session cookies" and "persistent 
              cookies". </p>
            <p>Session cookies store information only for the length of time that 
              you are connected to a web site - they are not written onto your 
              hard drive. Once you leave the web site, the originator of the cookie 
              no longer has the information that was contained on it.</p>
            <p>Purolator uses session cookies as an additional security feature. 
              When you log on to Purolator Online Shipping and are authenticated 
              through your User ID and password, a cookie will store the identification 
              number of your browser. Throughout your session, the session cookie 
              acts as a type of digital signature to identify your current session 
              to the web server. The web server will monitor the number of your 
              browser to ensure that, at all times during your session, we are 
              dealing with you.</p>
            <p>Purolator also uses session cookies to track your visits within 
              our web site. Purolator uses that information to determine the type 
              of information that you are looking for on our web site and to improve 
              our web site. Purolator uses information about the site you visited 
              immediately prior to our site to assess the viability of links to 
              our site that we have created on third party sites.</p>
            <p>The information stored in "persistent cookies" is written onto 
              your hard drive and remains there until the expiry date of the cookie. 
              Purolator uses persistent cookies to store non-sensitive information 
              that you are aware of and have agreed to. For example, if you choose 
              the option on our log on screen to remember your User ID, the system 
              will remember and automatically input your User ID each time you 
              use Purolator Online Shipping.</p>
            <p>Currently, most browsers do not distinguish between session cookies 
              and persistent cookies. For Purolator Online Shipping to operate, 
              your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you are concerned 
              about having your browser enabled to accept cookies while you are 
              surfing other web sites, we recommend that you enable your browser 
              to notify you when it is receiving a cookie. This gives you the 
              ability of accepting or rejecting any cookie presented by the web 
              server you are visiting. We suggest you contact the manufacturer 
              of your browser for information on how to do this.</p>
