      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Overview<br>
      	<br>
Our  Internet Hockey Superstore allows you to buy products and services, sign up for  a gift registry, enter contests, receive special discounts, apply for credit,  fill out surveys, and receive newsletters, e-mails or other promotional  information from us. We use the information that we collect about you to  fulfill your product and service purchases and to create a more personalized  online experience. This is just a brief overview, so please read on for more  details about our Privacy Policy. This Policy may change from time to time, so  please check back periodically. Except as limited below, we reserve the right  to use or disclose your personally identifiable information for business  reasons in whatever manner desired.<br>
<br>
Except  as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the  use and disclosure of information we collect from you online. For some  services, we either collect and transfer personal information to a service  provider you have selected, or you may visit other merchants through links on  our site who may collect and use your personal information. In those cases the  third-party service provider or merchant's privacy policy will govern how your  information is handled. We encourage you to ask questions and to be very  cautious before you disclose your personal information to others. <br>
<br>
Attn:  Privacy Compliance Officer<br>
Pure Hockey, LLC<br>
119 Dean Ave<br>
Franklin, MA. 02038<br>

<br>

<br>
1.  What information does Purehockey.com collect from you?<br>
<br>
In  order to better provide you with numerous products and services,  www.Purehockey.com collects two types of information about its visitors:  Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable  Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide  you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site. <br>
<br>
Personally Identifiable Information<br>
<br>
This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.  Personal information is requested when you register and set up an account,  order a product or service, register for a Wish List, enter contests or  sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this  information might include your name, billing address, shipping address,  telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and  product details. With this information, Purehockey.com can fill your orders and  better provide you with personalized services. If you visit another site  available through a link on our site, they will independently collect, use and  share your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies.  If you have questions about their information practices, please read their  privacy policies. <br>
<br>
Non-Personally Identifiable Information<br>
<br>
This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific  individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you shop  on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both  a personal and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include  the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came  from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet  Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and  other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a  computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol  ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web  use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the  destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically  assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web  servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in  order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. <br>
<br>
On an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous data related to the pages,  products, downloads and other content that is sampled, clicked on, streamed,  searched for, transferred from and downloaded. Except as otherwise limited in  this Policy, we may disclose, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally Identifiable  Information to others without your consent. <br>
<br>
2. Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?<br>
<br>
Our  primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide  www.Purehockey.com's visitors with a superior customized online experience. We  use the customer contact information to fill orders, contact purchasers to  inform them of their order status, to send promotional information, to enhance  the operation of our site and administer our systems. <br>
<br>
Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party advertising  servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents who provide us with the  zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages  viewed on our site. We review the actions of the Purehockey.com visitors on an  aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences. Purehockey.com also does  research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages viewed based on  the information provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from our server  log files, from our web site analysis agents, or from contests, drawings or  surveys. We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site,  to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site  use, to improve our product offerings, and to customize our site's content,  layout, and services. We receive reports from third party ad servers, content  servers, or web site analysis agents that tells us how many ads were presented  and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed. <br>
<br>
We may also share your personally identifiable information with third parties  who provide services to us, our customers and web site visitors. Those third  parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and  other companies working with us (collectively, "agents"). Where we believe  it to be appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to  disclose or use your personal information for purposes other than to provide  services to you or www.Purehockey.com. <br>
<br>
We gather information in the following ways: <br>
<br>
Shopping<br>
<br>
We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to gather  broad demographic information, to enable ads to be served on our site, to  report Non-Personally Identifiable Information to our advertisers, and to  monitor the level of activity on our site. We collect information from visitors  to our site regarding the URLs they came from, domain types (e.g., .com or  .org), their IP addresses, the date and time of their visit or order, the  number of visits and orders, the number of visits per browsing session, the  server type, the operating system and browser type used to come to the site,  the country, state and telephone area code where their servers are located, the  pages and page titles of our site that visitors viewed during their visit,  whether the visitor's computer is enabled for Java or cookies, browser  language, applications and plug-ins, and any search terms entered on our site. <br>
<br>
Ordering<br>
<br>
When you order from us, we collect personally identifiable information from  you. If you order one of our products or services, we will collect and maintain  your name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number,  product selections, credit card or other payment information, order number,  referring URL, IP address, page you bought from and a password. We collect  this, and other information, as disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill your  order, to communicate with you about your order and to send you promotional  materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to  review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information  it contained and these changes will be automatically kept for future use. We  may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. <br>
<br>
Gift Registry<br>
<br>
If you decide to create a Wish List through our site, you will create an  account, where we will collect and use your name, e-mail address, credit card  or other payment information, billing and shipping address, phone number,  password and product preferences. This information is subject to the terms of  this Privacy Policy except as explained here. Others will be able to search for  your Wist List using your e-mail address unless you choose not to make your  Wist List searchable. Those who have access to your Wist List will be able to  see your name, e-mail address, city, state, and may have access to other  personal information and product information that you have entered into the  Gift List. If others place orders for items on your Gift List, they may have  access to your address. We will use the product preferences that you include in  your Gift List to inform you about offers that may be of interest to you. If  you provide us with the e-mail addresses of your family and friends, we will  use their e-mail addresses to send them your Gift List if you instruct us to.  With your permission, we will send them the Gift List using your e-mail address  as the originating address. We will not use the e-mail addresses of your family  and friends for any other purpose. <br>
<br>
Gift Cards<br>
<br>
If you purchase a gift card from our site, you will give us the recipient's  name and e-mail address if you wish to send the certificate by e-mail. If you  wish to send a gift card by regular mail, you will give us the name, mailing  information and phone number for the recipient. The recipient information you  give us will only be used to send the gift certificate and for no other  purpose. <br>
<br>
Online Surveys and Polling<br>
<br>
In order to improve our services to you, we ask some of our customers to  voluntarily complete surveys, which may be collected by an independent third  party. Individual survey answers are confidential, although Non-Personally  Identifiable Information is collected and disclosed to third parties. If you do  not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked. <br>
<br>
Contests and Sweepstakes<br>
<br>
When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask you for contact  information such as your name, address and e-mail address in order to  administer the contest, to send you promotional e-mails, notify winners and  make the winners' list publicly available pursuant to certain states' laws.  Your consent to such promotional use and disclosure of this information is a  condition of your participation. As a condition of receiving any prize, you  will be required to submit an Affidavit of Eligibility, for us to ensure that  you are eligible to receive the prize according to the Contest Rules. <br>
<br>
Newsletters, Promotional E-mails and Personalized On-line Ads<br>
<br>
We offer free newsletters, promotional e-mails and personalized on-line  advertisements as a service to our customers. We will send you newsletters and  e-mails periodically listing current specials and deals. You may  "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our newsletters, emails or  personalized on-line advertisements by following any unsubscribe instructions  in any e-mail, newsletter or personalized on-line advertisement you receive  from us, or by sending an e-mail to optout@purehockey.com. After doing so, if  you have opted out of receiving all newsletters, all promotional emails or all  personalized on-line ads, you will not receive future promotional emails,  newsletters or personalized on-line advertisements (as applicable), unless you  open a new account, enter a contest, or otherwise subsequently sign up to  receive newsletters, emails or personalized on-line advertisements. Please  Note: If you agree to receive e-mails from any of our third party service  providers or any third party merchants on our site, you will receive e-mails  separately from them, and information that you choose to disclose to them will  be subject to their privacy policy. If you later decide that you no longer want  to receive their e-mails, you will need to follow their own specific opt-out  instructions, as opting out to "optout@purehockey.com" as described  above will not opt you out of their promotional emails. <br>
<br>
Contact Information and Third Party Data<br>
<br>
If you contact www.Purehockey.com or our customer service representatives by  telephone, e-mail or letter, we may keep a record of your correspondence or comments.  If you report a problem with our site, we may collect such information in a  file specific to you. If you contact us through our feedback area or by calling  one of our customer service representatives, we may ask for your name, e-mail  address and order information in order to send you a reply. <br>
<br>
Advertising<br>
<br>
We may display advertisements on our site. By knowing a little about you,  Purehockey.com will be able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content  to you in the form of targeted banners and promotions. For example, advertisers  give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach.  Purehockey.com takes the advertisement and includes it in a www.Purehockey.com  e-mail to prior customers meeting that criterion. We may also have third-party  advertising servers display ads linked to certain search terms that you have  entered, or to certain pages that you are viewing. In this process, advertisers  never have access to individual account information. www.Purehockey.com may  share aggregated data with advertisers. We may also use advertising partners to  assist us in delivering personalized on-line ads to you through the use of  cookies while you are on the Internet. <br>
<br>
Web Site Use<br>
<br>
We also track customers' traffic patterns throughout their online session,  including which pages, information and advertisements a customer views while  using the site and what items they place in their basket or purchase. We use  your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer  our site and to gather demographic information. We may share aggregated  statistics about pages viewed on our site, sales and other shopping information  with third parties. <br>
<br>
Cookies<br>
<br>
We use cookies and may allow others to use cookies in the operation of our site;  to find out what cookies are and how they are used, click here. <br>

<br>
3. Who is collecting your information?<br>
<br>
Ad Servers and Content Servers<br>
<br>
We may use third party ad servers or content servers to serve ads, product  information, or other information both on and off our site. Those third parties  may use "action tags" or web beacons throughout the site to count the  number of visitors who click on a banner ad or other information and to track  the number of customers who continue on to make a purchase. They may also place  their own "cookie" on your computer to help those ads to run, analyze  site usage and to provide you with personalized on-line advertisements. With  respect to personalized on-line ad serving, our third party ad server may  collect your first name and/or a product group/category (chosen by Purehockey.com  based on your personal preferences and/or prior purchase history e.g., hockey  skates, composite sticks, etc.), which are used to serve you the most relevant  personalized on-line ad. Except as set in the following sentence, we do not  provide them with any of your Personally Identifiable Information. For more  information about the information they collect, please see the section  "Use of Cookies and Action Tags" below. To learn more about the  information practices of the third party ad serving company used to serve ads  on our site, Click here. To learn more about the information practices of the  third party ad serving company used to serve you personalized ads, Click here. <br>
<br>
Email Services<br>
<br>
We use a third party to send promotional e-mails to customers. Images contained  in the email may be served by the third party. They collect certain information  about you such as your IP address, browser type, your operating system, the  country and server your computer is logged onto, where the servers that your  computer is logged onto is located, the time and date that a particular email  was viewed, the area code and zip code associated with your server, and whether  you responded to a particular ad or email, products viewed and whether you  continued on to make a purchase. They may use a "cookie" or  "action tags." <br>
<br>
Website Analysis Agent<br>
<br>
We may contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our  Internet business and marketing. We use the services of marketing companies to  help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our  site. To do this, we use Action Tags and cookies provided by the marketing  companies on this site. The type of information we collect includes things such  as pages, information and advertisements viewed as well as what items are  placed in a shopping basket or purchased, the order number, the amount of a  purchase, the product number and the quantity purchased. By supplementing our  records, this information helps us learn things like what kinds of customers  our site attracts, which of our products most interest our customers, and what  kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although the marketing companies log  the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data  may and may not be used. <br>
<br>
Marketing Partners, Co-Branded Services, Framing/Windows on Third-Party Sites<br>
<br>
We may run promotions for merchants where you may visit the merchants' sites.  In some of those promotions, a window or frame containing the merchant's site  may appear. Any time you are in a window, you should assume that your personal  information is being collected, used and disclosed in accordance with that  merchant's policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you  supply to those merchants. Any information that you share with them will be  used and disclosed in accordance with that merchant's privacy policy. However,  once you click on a return link to our site, you can expect that further  information that you disclose will be treated in accordance with this Policy. <br>
<br>
Links and Banner Ads to Third-Party Sites<br>
<br>
Please be aware that our site may contain links to other sites on the Internet  that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices of  those websites linking from or to our site are not covered by this Policy.  These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit  personal information. Additionally, other companies or ad servers, which place  advertising on our site may collect information about you through the use of  cookies when you view or click on their advertising. We cannot control this  collection of information. You should contact advertisers directly if you have  any questions about their use of the information that they collect. <br>
<br>
4. With whom do we share your information?<br>
<br>
Other Parties Generally<br>
<br>
We may provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers'  sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third parties, but  these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information. We may  release account information when we believe that such release is reasonably  necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or to protect the rights,  property, and safety of www.Purehockey.com, our users, or others. If customers  do not pay us for products ordered, we may submit their account information to  a third party collection agency. We may also share your Personally Identifiable  Information with third parties who provide services to us, our customers and  web site visitors. Those third parties include authorized contractors,  temporary employees and consultants and other companies working with us. Where  we believe it to be appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our  agents not to disclose or use your personal information for purposes other than  to provide services to you or Purehockey.com. <br>
<br>
Data Analysis Agents<br>
<br>
The information collected by or for www.Purehockey.com may be provided to an  outside company for the purpose of analysis. That analysis is to help us to  improve our site and product selection, and to notify you of special offers  that may be of interest to you. That data analysis agent may not share any  Personally Identifiable Information with others, or use it for any other  purpose than to help &nbsp;Pure Hockey, LLC. <br>
<br>
Ad &amp; Content Servers, Advertisers, Image Servers and Website Analysis  Agents<br>
<br>
These third parties use their cookies' identification numbers and internal web  site tracking features to serve ads on our site and to collect aggregated  information to create statistics about our customers and visitors, traffic  patterns, and related site information. In the event that our ad servers  collect any Personally Identifiable Information on our behalf, it will not be  used by them or disclosed to any third parties. <br>
<br>
Compliance with Service of Process or Law Enforcement<br>
<br>
Occasionally Purehockey.com may be asked by law enforcement or judicial  authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate  governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon  receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement  investigation, without prior notice to you. Purehockey.com fully cooperates  with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for  illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies  any activities that we believe to be unlawful. <br>
<br>
Sweepstakes and Drawings<br>
<br>
When you enter a sweepstakes, drawing or other promotion, we may provide entry  information, including name, address, email address and age to the company  providing the prize or sponsoring the promotion. They may use your Personally  Identifiable Information to send you marketing or promotional materials or  other communications. <br>
<br>
Sale of the Company<br>
<br>
Purehockey.com reserves the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable  Information in the event that any such company is sold, in whole or in part,  either as an entire corporate entity or through an asset sale that includes a  customer information database. This right is reserved whether or not the  customer database is sold independently of any continuing operations of such  company. <br>
<br>
5. How can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information?<br>
<br>
We  believe you should have the ability to access and edit the personal information  that you have provided to us. During the online ordering process you can  review, change, or delete the information that you have submitted. You may  change any of your personal information in your account online at any time. We  encourage you to promptly update your information if it changes. You may ask to  have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we  keep track of past purchases, you cannot delete information associated with  past purchases. Also, as a security measure we "back up" the data  stored on our systems, and such prior information cannot be completely removed  from our databases. As a result, you should not expect that all of your  Personally Identifiable Information will be completely removed from our  backed-up databases. <br>
<br>
6. What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your  information?<br>
<br>
You  may "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our newsletters, emails or  personalized on-line advertisements by following any unsubscribe instructions  in any e-mail, newsletter or personalized on-line advertisement you receive  from us, or by sending an e-mail to optout@purehockey.com. After doing so, if  you have opted out of receiving all newsletters, all promotional emails or all  personalized on-line ads, you will not receive future promotional emails,  newsletters or personalized on-line advertisements (as applicable), unless you  open a new account, enter a contest, or otherwise subsequently sign up to  receive newsletters, emails or personalized on-line advertisements. Please  Note: If you agree to receive e-mails from any of our third party service  providers or any third party merchants on our site, you will receive e-mails  separately from them, and information that you choose to disclose to them will  be subject to their privacy policy. If you later decide that you no longer want  to receive their e-mails, you will need to follow their own specific opt-out  instructions, as opting out to "optout@purehockey.com" as described  above will not opt you out of their promotional emails. <br>
<br>
Ad-servers and other Content Servers: You may also set your browser so that it  will not accept "cookies" to prevent assignment from the ad server of  a unique identifier; however, you may experience difficulty shopping on our  site and performing other transactions if you do so. <br>
<br>
7. What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse,  or alteration of your information?<br>
<br>
In  order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order  fulfillment are handled by established third party banking, processing agents  and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify  and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and  ship your order. <br>
<br>
Within Purehockey.com, your information is kept on password protected, limited  access servers. Wherever possible and applicable, Purehockey.com servers reside  behind a corporate firewall that maintains controls on access to the system  from both our internal network and the Internet. <br>
<br>
8. A special note about children's privacy<br>
<br>
You  must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use this site. Our  policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personally  Identifiable Information about visitors under 13 years of age. If you are the  parent or guardian of a child under 13 years of age and believe that they have  disclosed personally identifiable information to us, please contact us at  privacy@purehockey.com so that we may delete the child's information. <br>
<br>
9. Purehockey.com and third-party use of "cookies" and "action  tags."<br>
<br>
Purehockey.com  Cookies: When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order  to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text  file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web  browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to Purehockey.com.  Our cookies store randomly assigned user identification numbers, the country  where you are located, and your first name to welcome you back to our site. The  cookies make your use of the site easier, allow you to retrieve an earlier  shopping cart, make the site run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure  site. You will be unable to shop on our site without your browser set to accept  cookies. <br>
<br>
Ad Server and Content Server Cookies: We may use an outside ad serving company  or content server to display banner advertisements and other information on our  site and other sites or to serve promotional emails or personalized on-line  ads. As part of their service, they place a separate cookie on your computer.  Except for the company that serves our promotional emails and the company that  serves personalized on-line ads, Purehockey.com does not provide third-party ad  servers with any of your Personally Identifiable Information. Purehockey.com  and its third party ad servers do collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable  Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the URLs from  which you came, referring site's domain types (e.g., .com), operating system,  the country, the server your computer is logged onto, where the servers that  your computer is logged onto is located, the pages of our site and products  that visitors viewed during their visit, where an ad was placed on a specific  web site page, the time and date particular ads were served, the area code and  zip code associated with your server and whether you responded to a particular  ad, and a receipt identifier. <br>
<br>
Personalized On-line Ad Serving: We may provide the company that serves our personalized  on-line ads with your first name and/or with a product group/category (chosen  by Purehockey.com based on your personal preferences and/or prior purchase  history e.g., skates, composite sticks, etc.), which are used to serve you the  most relevant personalized on-line ad. The unique identifier included within  the cookie placed tells the ad serving company to serve you a personalized  on-line ad when you visit the site of a participating web site within the  network. The foregoing personally identifying information is not disclosed to  the participating web sites. <br>
<br>
Image Server Cookies: As part of the ad-serving process, a third party may  serve graphics upon our site. In order to customize their service, they may  also place a cookie upon your computer. While Purehockey.com does not control  their use of that cookie, no Personally Identifiable or individual customers'  product information is collected. <br>
<br>
Website Analysis Agent Cookies: We may use a third party to analyze what our  visitors find to be most interesting on our site. To do that, they will place a  cookie on your computer with a randomly assigned unique number in order to  track the pages you view on our site, along with other Non-Personally  Identifiable Information. <br>
<br>
Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a  web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track  responses or actions by customers who view certain advertisements or other  information on our site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website  page that are used to transparently collect information. Our ad server, content  servers, affiliate program manager and website analysis agents may use action  tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad  or visit the pages of our site and to provide information about what products  are viewed or purchased. Without collecting any personally identifiable  information, they use that data to tell us (and other advertisers) which ads  are the most effective on particular sites. Our ad server, content server,  affiliate program manager and website analysis agents may use an action tag on  our basket page, checkout page, and other pages, to keep anonymous track of the  number of times that clicking on a banner ad or views other information on our  site results in a purchase. They also collect the amount of the purchase, order  confirmation number, stock keeping unit number, quantity and identity of  product purchased. <br>
<br>
E-mail Distributor's Use of Action Tags: Our third-party e-mail distributor may  also use action tags. They may, for example, keep track of when a promotional  e-mail is opened and provide Purehockey.com with ongoing aggregated reports of  how many customers have responded. We share with them web site usage  information about visitors to our web site who have received a promotional  e-mail or other targeted promotional campaign. They use the information for the  purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in  reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our third-party e-mail  distributor note some of the pages you visit on our web site through the use of  action tags. <br>
<br>
