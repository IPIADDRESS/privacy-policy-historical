                       <h3>PUREVOLUME.COM - PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
				    <p>Welcome to PureVolume.com (“PureVolume”), owned, produced and operated by Unborn Media, Inc. (“Unborn Media”) and, potentially, in part or in whole, by its parents, subsidiary and affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as “Unborn Companies”). Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any current, updated and new products and services (“Products and Services”), including the addition of new properties shall be subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as the General Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms and Conditions”).   By using PureVolume you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions, whether or not you register as a listener (“Listener”).  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. </p>
				    <p>PureVolume.com is a music-oriented content and information website that provides a service to musical artists and to record companies on behalf of musical artists (each an “Artist” and collectively “Artists”) to post information regarding themselves as well as musical content owned and/or created by them.  PureVolume members can view each others' profiles (“Profiles”), communicate with each other, share photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests. Registered Listeners can change their Profile information at any time and can control how other Listeners and the service communicates with them.  Listeners and Artists are sometimes referred to hereinafter individually and collectively as “Users.” </p>
				    <p>PureVolume cares about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@purevolume.com">privacy[at]PureVolume[dot]com</a>.</p>
				    
                        <h4>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE BY PUREVOLUME</h4>
                        <p>PureVolume collects User submitted personal information such as name, mailing address, email address, telephone number and age to authenticate Users, and to send notifications to those Users relating to, without limitation, the PureVolume service, special events, contests and special offers. </p>
                        <p>As is standard practice on many corporate websites, PureVolume also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from Listeners and other visitors to the site.  This data is used to improve the website services, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. PureVolume will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.  This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to Listeners. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.</p>
                        <p>In addition PureVolume uses pixel tags — tiny graphic images — to tell us what parts of our website have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site.  Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read.  And they tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we’re only sending messages that are of interest to our customers. PureVolume stores all of this information in a secure database.</p>
                        <p>Listener Profile information including Listeners' pictures and first names is displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the PureVolume social networking community. Listeners' full names are never directly revealed to other Listeners.</p>
                        <p>PureVolume may also use a Listener’s email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service.  PureVolume may send email messages which use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the PureVolume website. When a customer clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. PureVolume tracks this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.</p>                                                
                        <p>From time to time, PureVolume or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on PureVolume. Listeners may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. PureVolume may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply. </p>
                        <p>PureVolume may also collect information for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service. PureVolume also collects information regarding customer activities on our website, and on related websites.  This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites and Internet services are of most interest to them.</p>

                        <h4>USE OF COOKIES</h4>
                        <p>PureVolume uses cookies to store visitors' preferences and to record session information, for purposes including ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements, to customize newsletter, advertising, and Web page content based on browser type and user profile information, to help track usage to help us understand which parts of our website are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. to make usage of our website even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer communications and to customize each visitor’s experience and provide greater convenience.</p>

                        <h4>EMAIL CHOICE / OPT OUT</h4>

                        <h4>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</h4>
                        <p>Ads appearing on PureVolume may be delivered to Listeners by PureVolume or one of our web advertising partners. Our web advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers only the use of cookies by PureVolume and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party advertisers. </p>

                        <h4>SECURITY</h4>

PureVolume uses reasonable measures such as encryption to protect private information that is stored within our database against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, and we restrict access to such private information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff.  Please note that PureVolume cannot guarantee the security of Listener or Artist account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time. Users are urged to also take precautions to protect their personal data by changing passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and using a secure web browser.
