<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Terms applicable only to property owners</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Payment and renewal</strong><br>18. Payment for advertising your property with us is made through the website using our PayPal™ account. Alternative methods of payment include RBS Worldpay or wire transfer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">19. Subject to these terms, properties are advertised on the website for a period of 3, 6 or 12 months at a time. Subscription fees are non refundable. Properties will be automatically advertised on the website for a further 12 month period on the expiry of any 12 month advertising period and you will be automatically debited with the applicable payment unless you advise us by e-mail to the applicable e-mail address prior to the expiry of the 12 month period that you do not wish to renew your advertising. We will notify you by e-mail that your 12 month advertising period is about to expire approximately 1 month in advance. Failure to receive this communication does not invalidate the automated renewal. The responsibility to cancel the renewal is that of the advertiser.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">20. You may cancel any automatic renewal and receive a refund of any payment which has been automatically deducted in respect of the renewal providing you notify us by e-mail to the applicable e-mail address within 14 days after payment has been deducted.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ability to advertise and to enter into contracts in respect of the property</strong><br>21. By loading material relating to a property onto this website, you warrant and confirm that you are legally entitled to do so and legally have full power and authority to enter into a contract with any person(s) or entity wishing to make a booking of the property for holiday rental purposes (subject always to your right to refuse particular bookings). Contracts for the rental of the property are entered into directly between you and person(s) or entity wishing to make a booking without any involvement on our part. We are entitled to require you to produce appropriate proof of your individual identity, your ownership of the property or authority to represent the owner in advertising and entering into contracts for use of the property for holiday purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Material posted on the website</strong><br>22. You warrant and represent that all material you post on the website is accurate, complete, up to date and fairly represents the property(ies) to which it relates and is not misleading in any respect. You warrant that all material is suitable for posting on the website given its nature and purpose and does not breach and is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and/or legal requirements. You are responsible for changing and updating it whenever required so that these warranties and representations at all times remain correct. You further warrant and represent that you own the copyright and all other intellectual property rights in any material you post (including without limitation any photograph(s)) or alternatively have the written permission of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property rights to use the same at all times while it is posted on the website. You also warrant and represent that you have the written permission of any and all persons (or their parent or guardian in relation to any child) shown in any photograph to post the same on the website. We are entitled at any time and without prior notice to remove, modify or refuse to accept any material (including, without limitation, any hypertext links or website addresses) where we, in our sole discretion, consider it appropriate to do so. You grant us a perpetual, royalty free, worldwide licence to display, use and reproduce all material posted on the website as we consider appropriate for the purpose of or in connection with advertising the property on the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Termination</strong><br>23. We are entitled to terminate the advertising of any property immediately on giving the property owner notice in writing (which may be by way of an e-mail to their last known e-mail address) (1) in the event of any material or repeated breach of these terms or any other terms which relate to the advertising of the property on the website by the property owner or any breach of these terms or any such other terms following any warning or communication from us in relation to any breach of these terms or any such other terms or (2) in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the property owner or (3) in the event of our having reason to believe that the property owner is no longer able to offer the property for holiday rental purposes either at all or for the reasonably foreseeable future or for substantial periods of time, for whatever reason or (4) in the event of our having reason to believe that the property owner is not complying with the law or any other legal requirements relating to the property or the letting of the same in any respect or is in any way behaving in a manner which may in our sole opinion damage or potentially damage our reputation or the reputation of the website. In the event of termination in any such circumstances, no refund of any payment made to us by the property owner will be made and we will have no liability whatsoever to the property owner.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Owner VERIFICATION badge</strong>&nbsp;<br>24.
