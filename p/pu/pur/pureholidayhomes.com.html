We may also use third parties who will collect non personally identifiable data (such as the IP address of a user’s &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computer) to analyse site visits, display advertising, conduct surveys or carry out other similar activities. In the course of doing so, they may place their own cookies on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your computer so that they can collect information about your visit and customise their services and advertising for later visits accordingly. You may if you wish disable &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or delete such cookies through your internet browser.

In addition to our storing and using your personal data, we would also like to pass it to other companies within our group to enable them to send you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marketing material which may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such marketing, there will be an ‘unsubscribe’ option on all email marketing or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternatively, send an unsubscribe request to: <a href="mailto:contact@pureholidayhomes.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">contact@pureholidayhomes.com</span></span></a></p>

We may also store, use or otherwise process personal data outside the EEA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data protection laws may not be as strong outside the EEA as they are in the EEA. Personal data will not be transferred to a country outside the EEA unless (1) the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country to which it is transferred is one which the European Commission considers to provide an adequate level of data protection or (2) the personal data is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transferred to a United States company which has signed up to the Safe Harbour scheme or (3) the personal data is transferred to a company which is required by our &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contract with them only to deal with the data in accordance with our instructions and to maintain appropriate security to protect the personal data which we are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;satisfied they have.</p>

We will charge a fee to respond to such a request. We promise to respond to your request within 40 days of receiving your written request and fee.&nbsp; In &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain limited circumstances we are entitled to refuse your request.&nbsp;</p>

We cannot accept any liability whatsoever and howsoever arising in relation to any such other websites (including, for the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avoidance of doubt and not by way of limitation, any inability to access or delay in accessing any such other website) or in relation to any material or information &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appearing on them or which you may otherwise come across after leaving our site by way of a hypertext link or any other means.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclaimers</strong><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We shall not be liable for any loss or damage or other sum or claim of any nature whatsoever (direct, indirect, consequential or other) which arises, directly or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indirectly, in connection with this website including, for the avoidance of doubt and not by way of limitation, any material appearing on this website or any inability to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;access or use (or delay in doing so) this website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We make no warranty that this website (or any websites that are linked to this website) is free from technical errors, computer viruses or any other malicious or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impairing computer programs. &nbsp;It is your responsibility to ensure you carry out sufficient checks (including virus checks) to protect your own computer system.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. All exclusions of liability apply only to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. If any exclusion(s) or limitation(s) contained in these terms is found, in whole or part, to be unlawful, void or for any other reason unenforceable to any extent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and/or for any purpose(s), that exclusion(s) or limitation(s) or the part(s) in question shall be deemed severable and omitted from these terms to the extent and/or for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the purpose(s) for which it is unenforceable. Such omission shall not affect the validity, effectiveness or enforceability of the other provisions of these Conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. Without prejudice to any other provision(s) of these terms, we are entitled to the benefit of any applicable exclusions and/or limitations of liability permitted by the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laws of any country found to be applicable to this website or any material appearing on it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alteration of these terms</strong><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.&nbsp; We may alter these terms at any time and without prior notice.&nbsp; If we do so, all subsequent use of our website will be governed by the newer version.&nbsp; You must &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accordingly check these terms regularly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terms applicable only to property owners</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. Subject to these terms, properties are advertised on the website for a period of 12 months at a time. Properties will be automatically advertised on the website &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a further 12 month period on the expiry of any 12 month advertising period and you will be automatically debited with the applicable payment unless you advise us &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by e-mail to the applicable e-mail address prior to the expiry of the 12 month period that you do not wish to renew your advertising. We will notify you by e-mail that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your 12 month advertising period is about to expire approximately 1 month in advance. Failure to receive this communication does not invalidate the automated &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;renewal. The responsibility to cancel the renewal is that of the advertiser.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.

You warrant and represent that all material you post on the website is accurate, complete, up to date and fairly represents the property(ies) to which it relates and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not misleading in any respect. You warrant that all material is suitable for posting on the website given its nature and purpose and does not breach and is in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compliance with any and all applicable laws and/or legal requirements.

You further warrant and represent that you own the copyright and all other intellectual property rights in any material &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you post (including without limitation any photograph(s)) or alternatively have the written permission of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property rights to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the same at all times while it is posted on the website. You also warrant and represent that you have the written permission of any and all persons (or their parent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or guardian in relation to any child) shown in any photograph to post the same on the website. We are entitled at any time and without prior notice to remove, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modify or refuse to accept any material (including, without limitation, any hypertext links or website addresses) where we, in our sole discretion, consider it appropriate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to do so. You grant us a perpetual, royalty free, worldwide licence to display, use and reproduce all material posted on the website as we consider appropriate for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the purpose of or in connection with advertising the property on the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination</strong><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. We are entitled to terminate the advertising of any property immediately on giving the property owner notice in writing (which may be by way of an e-mail to their &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last known e-mail address) (1) in the event of any material or repeated breach of these terms or any other terms which relate to the advertising of the property on the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;website by the property owner or any breach of these terms or any such other terms following any warning or communication from us in relation to any breach of these &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terms or any such other terms or (2) in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the property owner or (3) in the event of our having reason to believe that the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property owner is no longer able to offer the property for holiday rental purposes either at all or for the reasonably foreseeable future or for substantial periods of time, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for whatever reason or (4) in the event of our having reason to believe that the property owner is not complying with the law or any other legal requirements relating to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the property or the letting of the same in any respect or is in any way behaving in a manner which may in our sole opinion damage or potentially damage our reputation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the reputation of the website. In the event of termination in any such circumstances, no refund of any payment made to us by the property owner will be made and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will have no liability whatsoever to the property owner.</p>
