<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 22.3pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">Nature of this website</span></strong><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"> 1. This website is an auction facility where owners of second homes both in the UK and overseas can create an auction lot for a stay in their home that can be bid on by potential holidaymakers. Its purpose is to enable property owners to </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">advertise the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">availability of their properties for holiday rentals in an auction format to persons visiting </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">the website. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 17.9pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">2. A booking constitutes a winning bid or a purchase of the „buy it now price</span><span style="font-family: ">‟</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;"> and are </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">made directly between the property owners and the person(s) concerned. All contracts for the rental of any properties are entered into directly between the property owners and the person(s) making the booking. We do not have any involvement in and are not a party to any booking or contract for the rental of any property or otherwise. We are not the agent of any property owner. We have no responsibility for the acts, defaults, omissions, errors, breach of contract, negligence, misrepresentation or other fault or failings of any description on the part of any property owner(s) or other third party. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 41.15pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 182.1pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Terms applicable to bidding holidaymakers </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 24.6pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">1. You must be 18 or over to register with and use this website and be able to enter a legally binding contract. By registering with and using this website within the capacity outlined above, you warrant that you are 18 or older, have the capacity to enter into contracts and understand your obligations under these terms &amp; conditions. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 2.15pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">2. The owner of the property and creator of the auction lot will set a reserve price for each lot. If no bids are made which meet the reserve price the auction lot will end without a </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">winner. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 1.85pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">3. Incremental bids are allowed on Bidango and the current highest bid on an auction item will be displayed in real time. As a holidaymaker submitting bids, you have the capacity to set a maximum you would be prepared to pay for the auction item and Bidango will then place incremental bids automatically until such time that you have won the item or </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">your maximum limit has been outbid. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 15.8pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">4. When a bid is placed on an auction lot, the user will receive emails confirming a bid has been placed, when he/she has been outbid and when he/she has won or lost the auction lot. By logging in to your bidding history, a holidaymaker can view the progress of all current bids, all past bids and all lots won or lost. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 18.95pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">5. Bidding holidaymakers need to be aware that any bid placed is a confirmed offer to purchase the auction lot at that price and will become a binding contract if successful. Once a bid has been placed, you will not have the ability to withdraw that bid. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 21.55pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">6. If a holidaymaker places the winning bid on an auction lot you enter into a binding contract with the homeowner who created the auction lot. If an auction lot is won 6 weeks or more from the dates the holiday lot must be taken, the holidaymaker must make an immediate deposit payment through Bidango and then settle the final balance in accordance with the booking conditions of the owner. If a holidaymaker places the winning bid on an auction lot that is within 6 weeks of the dates the holiday lot must be taken, the holidaymaker must make an immediate deposit payment through Bidango and </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">settle the final balance with the homeowner within 24 hours. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 6.25pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">7. If any payment from the winning holidaymaker fails or if the winning holidaymaker is in breach of any of the terms and conditions above, Bidango will attempt to contact the second highest bidder on behalf of the homeowner. If the second highest bidder cannot be </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">reached, Bidango will attempt to contact the third </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">highest bidder and so on. If both parties are not in agreement that the bid should be honoured, the lot may be reopened or removed, depending upon the wishes of the owner. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 16.8pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">8. The winning holidaymaker bidder agrees to the booking terms and conditions of the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">homeowner. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 51.1pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">9. Winning bidders acknowledge that all material (including but not limited to descriptions, photographs, images, video, plans, maps and other information) relating to the properties which appears on this website is provided by the property owners and is the sole responsibility of the property owners. We do not check this material and make no express or implied warranty, representation or promise that it is accurate, current or complete or that properties are available either generally or for or during any particular period(s) of time. Nothing on this website constitutes an offer on our part. We do not visit or assess any property and make no warranty or representation that it complies with any description given, any laws or health and safety requirements or as to its suitability, standard, quality or otherwise. Upon a winning bid being placed, the binding contract is between the winning bidder and the homeowner who created the auction lot and is of no </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">responsibility to Bidango. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 189.15pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Terms applicable only to property owners </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 24.6pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">1. You must be 18 or over to register with and use this website and be able to enter a legally binding contract. By registering with and using this website within the capacity outlined above, you warrant that you are 18 or older, have the capacity to enter into contracts and understand your obligations under these terms &amp; conditions. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 31.1pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">2. You agree to adhere to the terms &amp; conditions enclosed and warrant that you are legally permitted to as the owner or managing agent of the property. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 10pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">3. You agree to deliver on the holiday lot where the sale has been agreed (as determined above), unless the winning holidaymaker cannot meet the terms of the sale agreed. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 6.4pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">4. You will not manipulate or attempt to manipulate the bidding process of an auction lot or work in conjunction with others to raise the bids for an auction lot whether related to </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">your own auction lot or those of another user. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 36.35pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">5. You will not seek to avoid the applicable commission fees owed to Bidango by attempting to make direct contact with bidding holidaymakers or manipulating the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">payment process in any way. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 21.6pt 0.0001pt 0cm; line-height: normal;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">6. When a bid is placed on your auction lot, you will receive emails confirming when each bid has been placed, when the lot has been won or when the lot has been closed due to no bids matching the reserve price. By logging in to your owner area, you can view the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">progress of all current lots and all past lots. </span></p>
