<p><b>6.DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></p>
<p>In addition to the Nestlé entities mentioned in the data controllers and contact section (see Section 12), We share your Personal Data with the following types of third party organisations</p>
<p><u><b>Service providers.</b></u> These are external companies that We use to help Us run our business (e.g. order fulfilment, payment processing, fraud detection and identity verification, website operation, market research companies, support services,
    promotions, website development, data analysis, CRC, etc.).<br> Service providers, and their selected staff, are only allowed to access and use your Personal Data on Our behalf for the specific tasks that they have been requested <br>to carry out,
    based on our instructions, and are required to keep your Personal Data confidential and secure. Where required by applicable law, you can obtain a list of the providers processing your Personal Data (see Section 12 to contact Us).</p>
<p><u><b>Credit reporting agencies/debt collectors. </b></u>To the extent permitted by applicable law, credit reporting agencies and debt collectors are external companies that We use to help Us to verify your creditworthiness (in particular for orders with
    invoice) or to collect outstanding invoices.</p>
<p><u><b>Third party companies using Personal Data for their own marketing purposes. </b></u>Except in situations where you have given your consent, We do not license or sell your Personal Data to third party companies for their own marketing purposes. Their
    identity will be disclosed at the time your consent is sought.</p>
<p><u><b>Third party recipients using Personal Data for legal reasons or due to merger/acquisition. </b></u>We will disclose your Personal Data to third parties for legal reasons or in the context of an acquisition or a merger (see Section 5 for details).</p>
<p><b>7. RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></p>
<p>Nestlé takes every reasonable step to ensure that your personal data are only processed for the minimum period necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice. The criteria for determining the retention period for your Personal Data are:</p>
<p>(a) Nestlé will retain copies of your Personal Data in a form that allows for identification only for as long as: </p>

<p class="col-sm-offset-1">(i) We maintain an ongoing relationship with you (e.g. where you are included in our mailing list and have not unsubscribed)</p>
<p class="col-sm-offset-1">(ii) Your Personal Data are necessary in connection with the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice and we have a valid legal basis, </p>

<p>(b) The duration of:</p>

<p class="col-sm-offset-1">(i) any applicable limitation period (i.e. any period during which a person could bring a legal claim against us), and</p>
<p class="col-sm-offset-1">(ii) an additional 2 months following the end of the applicable limitation period (so we are able to identify any personal data of a person who may bring a claim at the end of the applicable period),</p>

<p>(c) In addition, if any relevant legal claims are brought, we may continue to process your Personal Data for such additional time necessary in connection with that claim.</p>
<p>During the periods noted in paragraphs b (i) and b (ii) above, we will restrict our processing of your Personal Data to storage or, and maintaining the security of, those data, except to the extent the data need to be reviewed in connection with any claim,
    or any obligation under applicable law.</p>
<p>Once the periods in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, each to the extent applicable, have concluded, we will either</p>

<p class="col-sm-offset-1">(i) permanently delete or destroy the relevant Personal Data or </p>
<p class="col-sm-offset-1">(ii) anonymise the relevant Personal Data.</p>

<p><b>8.    DISCLOSURE, STORAGE AND/OR TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></p>
<p>We use appropriate measures (described below) to keep your Personal Data confidential and secure. Please note, however, that these protections do not apply to information you choose to share in public areas such as third party social networks.</p>
<p><u><b>People who can access your Personal Data. </b></u>Your Personal Data will be processed by our authorised staff or agents, on a need to know basis, depending on the specific purposes for which your Personal Data have been collected (e.g. our staff
    in charge of consumer care matters will have access to your consumer record).</p>
<p><u><b>Measures taken in operating environments. </b></u>We store your Personal Data in operating environments that use reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorised access. We follow reasonable standards to protect Personal Data. The transmission
    of information via the Internet is, unfortunately, not completely secure and although We will do our best to protect your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee the security of the data during transmission through our Websites/apps.</p>
<p><u><b>Measures We expect you to take. </b></u>It is important that you also play a role in keeping your Personal Data safe and secure. When signing up for an online account, please be sure to choose an account password that would be difficult for others
    to guess and never reveal your password to anyone else. You are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for any use of your account. If you use a shared or public computer, never choose to have your login ID/email address or password
    remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time you leave the computer. You should also make use of any privacy settings or controls We provide you in our Website/app.</p>
<p><u><b>Transfer of your Personal Data. </b></u></p>
<p><u><b>Transfer of your Personal Data. </b></u>Because of the international nature of our business, we may need to transfer your personal data within the Nestlé group, and to third parties as noted in Section 6 above, in connection with the purposes set
    out in this Privacy Notice. The storage as well as the processing of your Personal Data as described above may require that your Personal Data are ultimately transferred/transmitted to, and/or stored at, a destination outside of your country of residence,
    notably Germany and Switzerland.
    </p><p>We will also transfer your Personal Data to countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (e.g. other Nestlé entities) including to countries which have different data protection standards to those which apply in the EEA. We (i) have put in
        place European Commission approved standard contractual clauses to protect your Personal Data (and you have a right to ask Us for a copy of these clauses(by contacting Us as set out below) and/or (ii) will rely on your consent (where permitted
        by law).</p>
<p><b>9.    YOUR RIGHTS</b></p>
<p><u><b>Access to Personal Data. </b></u>You have the right to access, review and request a physical or electronic copy of information held about you. You also have the right to request information on the source of your Personal Data.</p>
<p>These rights can be exercised by sending Us an email <a href="mailto:UKI.Dataprotection@uk.nestle.com">UKI.Dataprotection@uk.nestle.com</a> or writing to us at
    <font color="blue"> <u>Data Protection Nestle UK&amp;I, Legal Department, 1 City Place, Gatwick, RH6 0PA,</u></font>
</p>
<p>attaching a copy of your ID or equivalent details (where requested by Us and permitted by law). If the request is submitted by a person other than you, without providing evidence that the request is legitimately made on your behalf, the request will be
    rejected. Please note that any identification information provided to Us will only be processed in accordance with, and to the extent permitted by applicable laws.</p>
<p><u><b>Additional rights (e.g. modification, deletion of Personal Data). </b></u>Where provided by law, you can (i) request deletion, the portability, correction or revision of your Personal Data; (ii) limit the use and disclosure of your Personal Data;
    and (iii) revoke consent to any of our data processing activities. </p>
<table class="personal-data" border="1" align="left">

            Subject to applicable law, you may also have the following additional rights regarding the use of your Relevant Personal Data:

<p>Please note that, in certain circumstances, We will not be able to delete your Personal Data without also deleting your user account. We may be required to retain some of your Personal Data after you have requested deletion, to satisfy our legal or contractual
obligations. We may also be permitted by applicable laws to retain some of your Personal Data to satisfy our business needs.
<br clear="left"> Where available, our Websites have a dedicated feature through which you can review and edit the Personal Data that you have provided. Please note that We require our registered consumers to verify their identity (e.g. login ID/email
address, password) before they can access or make changes to their account information. This helps prevent unauthorised access to your account.</p>

<p>We hope that We can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your Personal Data. However, if you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to competent data protection authorities.</p>
<p><b>10.    YOUR CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></p>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Data that you provide to Us. The following mechanisms give you the following control over your Personal Data:</p>
<p><u><b>VVCookies/Similar Technologies. </b></u>. You manage your consent via (i) our consent management solution or (ii) your browser so as to refuse all or some cookies/similar technologies, or to alert you when they are being used. Please see Section
    4 above.</p>
<p><u><b>Advertising, marketing and promotions</b></u>You can consent for your Personal Data to be used by Nestlé to promote its products or services through tick-box(es) located on the registration forms or by answering the question(s) presented by our
    CES representatives. If you decide that you no longer wish to receive such communications, you can subsequently unsubscribe from receiving marketing-related communications at any time, by following the instructions provided in each such communication.
    To unsubscribe from marketing communications sent by any medium, including third party social networks, you can opt-out at any time by unsubscribing through links available in our communications, logging into the Websites/apps or third party social
    networks and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by unchecking the relevant boxes or by calling our CES. Please note that, even if you opt-out from receiving marketing communications, you will still receive administrative communications
    from Us, such as order or other transaction confirmations, notifications about your account activities (e.g. account confirmations, password changes, etc.), and other important non marketing related announcements.</p>
<p><u><b>Personalization (offline and online): </b></u>Where required by law, if you wish to have your Personal Data used by Nestlé to provide you with a personalized experience/targeted advertising &amp; content, you can indicate so through the relevant tick-box(es)
    located on the registration form or by answering the question(s) presented by our CES representatives. If you decide that you no longer wish to benefit from this personalization, you can opt-out at any time by logging into the Websites/apps and adjusting
    your user preferences in your account profile by unchecking the relevant boxes or by calling our CES.</p>
<p><u><b>Targeted Advertising</b></u>We partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) that serve advertising on behalf of Us and other non-affiliated companies on the Internet. Some of those advertisements are tailored
    to your interests based on information collected on Nestlé sites or on non-affiliated websites over time. You can visit www.aboutads.info/choices to learn more about this type of advertising, as well as about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising
    practices from companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) self-regulatory program. Additionally, you can opt-out of this type of advertising in mobile applications from companies that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices
    app by downloading the app from the iOS or Android app store. You can also stop the collection of precise location data from a mobile device by accessing your device location service settings.</p>
