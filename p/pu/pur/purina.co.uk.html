<p><b>6.DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></p>
<p>In addition to the Nestlé entities mentioned in the data controllers and contact section (see Section 12), We share your Personal Data with the following types of third party organisations</p>
<p><u><b>Service providers.</b></u> These are external companies that We use to help Us run our business (e.g. order fulfilment, payment processing, fraud detection and identity verification, website operation, market research companies, support services,
    promotions, website development, data analysis, CRC, etc.).<br> Service providers, and their selected staff, are only allowed to access and use your Personal Data on Our behalf for the specific tasks that they have been requested <br>to carry out,
    based on our instructions, and are required to keep your Personal Data confidential and secure. Where required by applicable law, you can obtain a list of the providers processing your Personal Data (see Section 12 to contact Us).</p>
<p><u><b>Credit reporting agencies/debt collectors. </b></u>To the extent permitted by applicable law, credit reporting agencies and debt collectors are external companies that We use to help Us to verify your creditworthiness (in particular for orders with
    invoice) or to collect outstanding invoices.</p>
<p><u><b>Third party companies using Personal Data for their own marketing purposes. </b></u>Except in situations where you have given your consent, We do not license or sell your Personal Data to third party companies for their own marketing purposes. Their
    identity will be disclosed at the time your consent is sought.</p>
<p><u><b>Third party recipients using Personal Data for legal reasons or due to merger/acquisition. </b></u>We will disclose your Personal Data to third parties for legal reasons or in the context of an acquisition or a merger (see Section 5 for details).</p>
<p><b>7. RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></p>
<p>Nestlé takes every reasonable step to ensure that your personal data are only processed for the minimum period necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice. The criteria for determining the retention period for your Personal Data are:</p>
<p>(a) Nestlé will retain copies of your Personal Data in a form that allows for identification only for as long as: </p>

<p class="col-sm-offset-1">(i) We maintain an ongoing relationship with you (e.g. where you are included in our mailing list and have not unsubscribed)</p>
<p class="col-sm-offset-1">(ii) Your Personal Data are necessary in connection with the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice and we have a valid legal basis, </p>

<p>(b) The duration of:</p>

<p class="col-sm-offset-1">(i) any applicable limitation period (i.e. any period during which a person could bring a legal claim against us), and</p>
<p class="col-sm-offset-1">(ii) an additional 2 months following the end of the applicable limitation period (so we are able to identify any personal data of a person who may bring a claim at the end of the applicable period),</p>

<p>(c) In addition, if any relevant legal claims are brought, we may continue to process your Personal Data for such additional time necessary in connection with that claim.</p>
<p>During the periods noted in paragraphs b (i) and b (ii) above, we will restrict our processing of your Personal Data to storage or, and maintaining the security of, those data, except to the extent the data need to be reviewed in connection with any claim,
    or any obligation under applicable law.</p>
<p>Once the periods in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, each to the extent applicable, have concluded, we will either</p>

<p class="col-sm-offset-1">(i) permanently delete or destroy the relevant Personal Data or </p>
<p class="col-sm-offset-1">(ii) anonymise the relevant Personal Data.</p>

<p><b>8.    DISCLOSURE, STORAGE AND/OR TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></p>
<p>We use appropriate measures (described below) to keep your Personal Data confidential and secure. Please note, however, that these protections do not apply to information you choose to share in public areas such as third party social networks.</p>
<p><u><b>People who can access your Personal Data. </b></u>Your Personal Data will be processed by our authorised staff or agents, on a need to know basis, depending on the specific purposes for which your Personal Data have been collected (e.g. our staff
    in charge of consumer care matters will have access to your consumer record).</p>
<p><u><b>Measures taken in operating environments. </b></u>We store your Personal Data in operating environments that use reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorised access. We follow reasonable standards to protect Personal Data. The transmission
    of information via the Internet is, unfortunately, not completely secure and although We will do our best to protect your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee the security of the data during transmission through our Websites/apps.</p>
<p><u><b>Measures We expect you to take. </b></u>It is important that you also play a role in keeping your Personal Data safe and secure. When signing up for an online account, please be sure to choose an account password that would be difficult for others
    to guess and never reveal your password to anyone else. You are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for any use of your account. If you use a shared or public computer, never choose to have your login ID/email address or password
    remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time you leave the computer. You should also make use of any privacy settings or controls We provide you in our Website/app.</p>
<p><u><b>Transfer of your Personal Data. </b></u></p>
<p><u><b>Transfer of your Personal Data. </b></u>Because of the international nature of our business, we may need to transfer your personal data within the Nestlé group, and to third parties as noted in Section 6 above, in connection with the purposes set
    out in this Privacy Notice. The storage as well as the processing of your Personal Data as described above may require that your Personal Data are ultimately transferred/transmitted to, and/or stored at, a destination outside of your country of residence,
    notably Germany and Switzerland.
    </p><p>We will also transfer your Personal Data to countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (e.g. other Nestlé entities) including to countries which have different data protection standards to those which apply in the EEA. We (i) have put in
        place European Commission approved standard contractual clauses to protect your Personal Data (and you have a right to ask Us for a copy of these clauses(by contacting Us as set out below) and/or (ii) will rely on your consent (where permitted
        by law).</p>
<p><b>9.    YOUR RIGHTS</b></p>
<p><u><b>Access to Personal Data. </b></u>You have the right to access, review and request a physical or electronic copy of information held about you. You also have the right to request information on the source of your Personal Data.</p>
<p>These rights can be exercised by sending Us an email <a href="mailto:UKI.Dataprotection@uk.nestle.com">UKI.Dataprotection@uk.nestle.com</a> or writing to us at

    rejected. Please note that any identification information provided to Us will only be processed in accordance with, and to the extent permitted by applicable laws.</p>
<p><u><b>Additional rights (e.g. modification, deletion of Personal Data). </b></u>Where provided by law, you can (i) request deletion, the portability, correction or revision of your Personal Data; (ii) limit the use and disclosure of your Personal Data;
    and (iii) revoke consent to any of our data processing activities. </p>

    from Us, such as order or other transaction confirmations, notifications about your account activities (e.g. account confirmations, password changes, etc.), and other important non marketing related announcements.</p>
<p><u><b>Personalization (offline and online): </b></u>Where required by law, if you wish to have your Personal Data used by Nestlé to provide you with a personalized experience/targeted advertising &amp; content, you can indicate so through the relevant tick-box(es)
