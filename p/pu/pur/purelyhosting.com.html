                            <h2 class="title">Opt-out Preferences</h2>
                            <p>By default, customers do not receive any voluntary system updates, such as the newsletters, invoices, and mailings.  Affiliates will receive periodic promotional emails, but can opt out at any time.  Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to adjust the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@PurelyHosting.com">privacy@PurelyHosting.com</a>.   Customers may not opt out of possibly receiving important system notifications, in the rare event that such notification would be necessary.</p>
                            <h2 class="title">Tracking Technologies / Cookies</h2>
                            <p>Your Internet browser has the in-built facility for storing small text files - "cookies" - that hold information which allows a website to recognize your account. We use cookies to save your preferences and login information, and provide personalized functionality. You can reject cookies by changing your browser settings, but be aware that this will disable some of the functionality on the Purelyhosting.com's website.</p>
                            <h2 class="title">Analytics / Log Files</h2>
                            <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our site and servers, track access, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. It is possible that personal information about a customer may be included in the log files due to the normal functions of IP addresses and Web browsing.</p>
                            <h2 class="title">Web Beacons / Gifs</h2>
                            <p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
                            <h2 class="title">Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting</h2>
                            <p>We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
                            <h2 class="title">Security</h2>
                            <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  PurelyHosting.com uses technical security measures to prevent the loss, misuse, alternation or unauthorized disclosure of information under our control. PurelyHosting.com uses security measures including and not limited to: physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. When we ask customers or users to provide financial information (such as a credit card number) that data is protected using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                            <h2 class="title">Additional Information</h2>
                            <h2 class="title">Links to 3rd Party Sites</h2>
                            <p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Purelyhosting.com.   If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.</p>
                            <h2 class="title">Changes To This Policy</h2>
                            <p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
