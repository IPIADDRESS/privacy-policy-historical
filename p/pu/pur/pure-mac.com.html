We use your IP address to gather broad demographic information pretty much so we
can say, "Cool, We got ten hits from Lithuania etc. today". We also log the type
of browser you are using just out of perverse curiosity. Pure Mac does not
solicit personal information of any type such as email addresses, personal names,
addresses etc. If such information were volunteered, Pure Mac would not share
such information unless you begged us and took us out to dinner.
