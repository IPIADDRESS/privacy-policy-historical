<p>
Your privacy is very important to Pure Networks, so we have created the following Privacy Policy to explain our information collection and use practices. Our Privacy Policy covers what information we collect through our products and services, how this information is used and how you may opt-out of this collection. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle the information we collect. By using our products and services, you consent and agree to the information collection and practices described in this policy.
</p><p>
<strong>Why we collect personal information</strong>
<br>
Pure Networks collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, provide you with convenient access to our products and services, alert you to available upgrades and products and make a wider range of our products available to you. In addition, with your permission, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, special offers and other related information. With your permission, this may occasionally include information from other technology companies about products and services that can add value to your Pure Networks products. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products.
</p><p>
<strong>How we collect personal information</strong>
<br>
We collect information about you in the following ways. When you download one of our products, we ask you for contact information so we can communicate with you about your product trial and product keys. When you purchase a product from Pure Networks, we require your contact and payment information for billing purposes. We might also ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, contact us to request support, register to attend a seminar, or participate in an online survey. When you register a new Pure Networks product or ask to be included in an e-mail mailing list, we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database.
</p><p>
To save you time and make our Web services even easier to use, some areas of the Pure Networks site allow you to create a "Pure Networks ID" using your personal information. Here's how it works: Simply fill out a brief profile—your name, phone number, and e-mail address—then choose a password and password hint (such as the month and day of your birth) for security. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal Pure Networks ID. Next time you order something from the Pure Networks Store or register a new product, you can simply enter your e-mail address and password—the system will automatically look up the information it needs.
</p><p>
<strong>Opting out or unsubscribing from email communications:</strong>
<br>
When downloading or purchasing we give you the option to opt out of future email communications other than critical updates. You can also unsubscribe or subscribe at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link included in our email communications and on our web sites under Support. You can also change your preference by clicking on the link below:
</p><p>
<a href="/support/unsubscribe.php">Unsubscribe from email communications.</a>
</p><p>
<strong>When we disclose personal information</strong>
<br>
Pure Networks does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

</p><ul>
<li>We may provide the information to trusted vendors who work on behalf of or with Pure Networks under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Pure Networks communicate with you about offers from Pure Networks and our partners, and to determine what those offers may be. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.</li>
<li>At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.</li>
<li>If Pure Networks or a portion of our assets are acquired by another company, customer information, including personally identifiable information, may be one of the transferred assets.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><p>
<strong>How we protect your personal information</strong>
<br>
Pure Networks safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.
</p><p>
<strong>Collecting non-personally identifiable information</strong>
<br>
Our products, including Network Magic, collect certain non-personally identifiable information about the status of Network Magic and your home network, and automatically transmits this data back to us on a regular basis so that we can determine how users are interacting with our products in order to determine ways that our products may be improved and to help us develop new products that will be of help to you. We may share this information in an anonymous aggregated form with select third parties. You may opt out of the collection of this information at any time by uninstalling Network Magic from your computer.
</p><p>
When you browse the Pure Networks or Network Magic site, you are able to do so anonymously. As happens with other web sites, your browser communicates on an anonymous basis, the type of computer, operating system, and web browser you are using.
</p><p>
<strong>Our companywide commitment to privacy</strong>
<br>
To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every Pure Networks employee.
</p><p>
Any person who provides their personally identifiable information to us through any of our products or services represents to us that they are 13 years of age or older. We do not ask children who identify themselves as being under the age of 13 for any personally identifiable information. We also restrict them from accessing or using any of our products or services that require them to enter personally identifiable information.
</p><p>
The Pure Networks and Network Magic sites may contain links to other sites. Pure Networks does not share your personal information with those sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.
</p><p>
We may periodically update our Privacy Policy. We may notify you about significant changes to the Privacy Policy via e-mail address specified in your account, or by placing a notice on the Pure Networks or Network Magic website. However, it is your responsibility to review the most recent version of our Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it. The most recent version of our Privacy Policy can always be found at the <a href="/privacy.php">Network Magic website</a>.
</p><p>
We do not guarantee error-free performance under this Privacy Policy. We may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. Accordingly, we welcome your feedback regarding any privacy concerns that you may have, including how we can improve our products and services generally. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with it. We will not be liable for any incidental, consequential, or punitive damages relating to this Privacy Policy.                         </p></div>
