Your privacy is our top concern. We work hard to earn and keep your trust, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:
<br><br><br><b>PublicOpinion respects your privacy.</b><br><br>
We make our best efforts to keep your information secure and safe, and welcome any knowledge and assistance on how to do that even better. Should you discover or otherwise have knowledge of a security vulnerability in our system, please let us <a href="/feedback.aspx">know first</a> and we shall endeavor to fix it immediately.

<br><br><br><b>Information Collection</b><br><br><i>Registration</i><br>
In order to become a member of PublicOpinion, you must first create an account on this web site. To create an account you are required to choose a username and a password.
<br><br><i>Profile Information</i><br>
Once a member, you may provide additional information. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better make use of the PublicOpinion system.<br><br><i>Cookies &amp; Log Files</i><br>
Like most web sites, PublicOpinion uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows PublicOpinion to recognize you as a member when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you may not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.
<br><br>

One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your PublicOpinion account. The next time you visit the PublicOpinion web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing member so you will not need to sign in before using the service.
<br><br>
Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the PublicOpinion web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave PublicOpinion. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the PublicOpinion service.
<br><br><i>Children</i><br>
Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors do not submit any personal information to us or use the service.
<br><br><br><b>Information Use</b><br><br>PublicOpinion is an online service dedicated to helping keep people share information with one another. In addition, PublicOpinion collects certain types of information in order to operate and improve our service to you and other members.
<br><br><i>PublicOpinion Communications</i><br>PublicOpinion will communicate with you through email and notices posted on this website. These include welcome emails and notices of new features. Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from PublicOpinion related to the proper functioning of your account.
<br><br><i>Customized Content</i><br>
Information you provide at registration or in your Profile section is also used to customize your experience on the web site.
<br><br><br><b>Information Sharing</b><br><br><i>Sharing Information With Third Parties</i><br>PublicOpinion takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will never sell, rent, share, transfer or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties without your explicit opt-in consent. We will only share your information with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services. For instance, we may in the future use a credit card processing company to bill members for subscription fees for enhanced versions of the service. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.
<br><br><i>Legal Disclaimer</i><br>
It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
<br><br><br><b>Accessing and Changing Your Account Information</b><br><br>
You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to the information, or to the settings for your PublicOpinion account, at any time by logging in to your account on the PublicOpinion website and editing the information on your Profile page. You can also close your account through the PublicOpinion website.

<br><br><br><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br><br>PublicOpinion may update this privacy policy. In the event there are significant changes in the way we treat your personal information, we will send a notice to the primary email notification address specified in your PublicOpinion account and by displaying a prominent notice on this site.
