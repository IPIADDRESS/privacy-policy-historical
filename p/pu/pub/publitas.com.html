<h1>Privacy Statement effective as of November, 2006</h1>
<br>
<p>
Publitas.com has drawn up this privacy statement (‘Statement’) in order to illustrate the tremendous importance that we 
attach to the privacy of our customers. Privacy on the Publitas.com website (the ‘Site’) is our main concern. 
It is because we compile significant data from our visitors and customers that we have drawn up this Statement 
in order to provide insight into the way in which we collect and process data. We reserve the right to amend this Statement.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Compiled data</h3>
<p>
When customers register to use the Publitas application, they are asked to provide certain contact details, 
such as their name, company name, address, telephone number and email address, financial information and billing details, 
such as the billing name and billing address, credit card number and the number of users in the organization 
using the application. Publitas.com uses the compiled data to adapt Publitas to individual users 
and their organization. This information may also be used to contact customers about their interest in Publitas.com 
and to distribute information about our company or our partners, for example news about special offers and events. 
Customers have the option to subscribe to a newsletter via email by providing their email address. 
We also use e-mail to communicate information about changes to Publitas. 
We do not share customer email addresses and any personal customer details with third parties. 
Customers can indicate at any given time that they no longer wish to be contacted by us or receive information from us by 
sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@publitas.com">support@publitas.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
Publitas.com customers use Publitas to host data and information (‘Data’). Publitas.com shall not view, share, distribute, 
print or refer to this Data except as specified in the Licensing Agreement. 
In some cases, individual records can be viewed or opened only if deemed necessary to resolve a problem, 
support issue or deal with suspected infringement of the Licensing Agreement, or as legally required. Of course, 
customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and safety of their user registration and password.
</p>
<p>
Publitas.com can also compile certain information from users, such as Internet addresses. 
This information is recorded for troubleshooting purposes and to improve the quality of the Publitas. 
We may also track and analyse data related to statistical use and volume, 
which incidentally cannot be traced back to individual users.
</p>
<p>
If users wish to avail themselves to our referral service to direct an associate to our site, 
we ask the user to provide the associate’s name and email address. The associate in question will 
automatically receive a one-time email from Publitas.com with an invitation to visit the site. Publitas.com does not save these details.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
Our goal is to make using the Publitas.com website as easy and useful as possible. When you visit our website, 
our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that web browsers send to a computer’s hard 
drive and are used to determine whether customers or visitors have visited the site previously.
</p>
<p>
It is impossible to discover your identity solely on the basis of cookies. Only your browser is recognized. 
You will remain anonymous to Publitas.com unless you choose to reveal your identity to Publitas.com. 
There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies expire as soon as the online session ends. 
They disappear from your computer as soon as you close the browser software or turn off the computer. 
Persistent cookies remain on your computer even after you have closed the browser or turned off the computer. 
These cookies contain data including a unique ID for your browser.
</p>
<p>
Publitas.com uses session cookies with encrypted data in order to determine your identity when you are logged on. 
The Publitas application processes your online transactions and requests with the help of this information. 
The session cookies enable us to verify your identity during the log on procedure. Although users who disable 
the use of cookies in their web browser can still visit our Site, they cannot use Publitas.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Third party sites</h3>
<p>
The Site includes links to other websites. Publitas.com is not responsible for the privacy policy or content of the 
websites in question. Customers and users are responsible for informing themselves about the policies of the other websites. 
In addition, customers and visitors who visit a linked site may consign personal details. It is up to the user to protect these details.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
Security measures apply to Site in order to prevent the loss, abuse or alteration of the data that we manage. 
When our site is opened with Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher, SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology using 
server verification and data encryption is applied in order to provide optimum protection to Data, and makes it accessible only to you. 
Publitas is offered in a secure server environment protected by a firewall and other advanced technology in order 
to prevent abuse by third parties. Lastly, Publitas.com issues unique user names and passwords that must be entered every time a customer logs on. 
These security measures prevent access by unauthorized parties, guarantee data accuracy and protect against wrongful use of data.
