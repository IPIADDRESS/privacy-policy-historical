</ol><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Committee on Publication Ethics ("COPE") is a charity registered in the United Kingdom (Registered Charity No 1123023, Registered in England and Wales, Company No 6389120). COPE is a member organisation which exists to educate and support editors, publishers and those involved in publication ethics with the aim of moving the culture of publishing towards one where ethical practices becomes the norm. When a journal or a publisher applies to be a member of COPE, we collect personal data which is needed to assist with the application process, usually someone to contact with questions or details of people connected to the journal in some way. COPE has two membership application forms, one for journals and one for publishers, where this data is collected. COPE also has a newsletter service which people can sign up to via the COPE website.</p>
<p>COPE does have working relationships with some organisations around the world whose mission is closely aligned to that of COPE's. These approved organisations promote publication ethics to local journals and publisher, host events under the COPE name or in association with COPE, and provide related services.</p>

<h3><a name="store" id="store"></a>3) HOW WE STORE PERSONAL DATA.</h3>

<p>The applications are held in a database within the back end of the COPE website. The back end of the web site is only accessible to the COPE Team, the COPE Chair(s), and our development partners, Deeson. We extract the personal information from the application forms into a separate and secure Microsoft Access database. This is only accessible by the COPE Team and members of the Membership Committee (<a href="https://publicationethics.org/about/subcommittees">https://publicationethics.org/about/subcommittees</a>). Journal and publisher names, the name of the Editor-in-Chief of a journal and other journal details are searchable and displayed on our website. Personal contact details, such as email addresses and address, are never displayed publicly and are not searchable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All individual users' details are stored in the back end of the COPE website and are only accessible by the individual, the COPE Team, the Cope Chair(s) and Deeson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passwords are encrypted and may not be read. They may be changed by individuals, the COPE Team or, rarely, Deeson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3.b COPE Digest, News and events newsletters</h4>
<p>The emails which we collect for our newsletters are stored in Mailchimp. Our use of Mailchimp and the security of your personal data is covered by Mailchimp's privacy policy <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3.c Contact Us</h4>
<p>The Contact Us form sends an email to an email client. The COPE Team use Gmail as their email client. When we answer your query or question, Gmail automatically saves your email address in the address book. We use 2 Factor Verification provided by Google for signing into Gmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3.d Event registrations</h4>
<p>The personal data collected via event registration forms is stored as a table in the back end of the web site. This table is exportable/downloadable and we download the information into Excel so we can then process the registration effectively (see 2.d above). These Excel spreadsheets are stored in our Google workspace and on COPE laptops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.g Complaints Procedure</strong></p>
<p>Personal data is stored in the back end of the website, submitted via an online form. Some data is held in an online form in our secure Google Drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="process" id="process"></a>4) HOW WE PROCESS PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<h4>4.a Journal and Publisher Membership Applications</h4>
<p>The data provided in applications is exported automatically into the Microsoft Access database. This happens by a secure connection. Reviewing membership applications is our legitimate interest so that we can fulfil our obligations to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4.b COPE Digest</h4>
<p>Upon signing up to Digest, your email address is added to our Mailchimp mailing list. The transfer happens via an API connecting the COPE website to Mailchimp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="share" id="share"></a>5) WHO WE SHARE DATA WITH</h3>
<p>COPE shares personal data with <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fraBG79jh_NQRCqyaa9aSTsOi_tp10sEAlNZRYv_Hlw/edit?usp=sharing">the third parties listed in the table in this spreadsheet</a>. They are contracted directly to COPE, providing us with services such as accounting, billing, printing, micropayments etc. The spreadsheet includes details of the data they receive from us, the service they provide us and a link to their privacy policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COPE does not share personal data with any other organisation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you register for a COPE Event, we will occasionally share your details with a co-hosting or partner organisation or services because you have told us that you want to attend the event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For our online newsletters, COPE uses Mailchimp. Details of this service are in Section 3.b above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="deletion" id="deletion"></a>6) HOW LONG WE STORE PERSONAL DATA FOR AND WHEN WE DELETE DATA</h3>
<h4>6.a Journal and Publisher Membership Applications</h4>
<p>We keep your personal data for as long as you or your organisation has a valid membership or as long as necessary to fulfil our obligations to you and protect our legal interests. This will never be longer than seven years from the end of your membership period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>6.b COPE Digest, News and event newsletters</h4>

<h3><a name="delete" id="delete"></a>7) HOW TO DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AND REQUEST THAT PERSONAL DATA IS DELETED.</h3>
<h4>7.a How to delete your account</h4>
<p>An individual may request at any time that COPE deletes all the user account from the COPE website. Do this by using our Contact Us form: <a href="https://publicationethics.org/contact-us">https://publicationethics.org/contact-us</a> If you want us to delete your account, name or email address but it is linked to a journal or a publisher membership then we will need to replace your details with those of another. In these cases it would be helpful if, when you contact us asking us to delete your account, you can provide the name and email address of a replacement. You must obtain that individual’s consent before sharing their personal data with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>7.b How to request that all personal data is deleted</h4>
<p>To request that COPE deletes all of the personal data that we hold about you, please send an email to the COPE Web Manager, Dom Mitchell: <a href="mailto:cope_webmanager@publicationethics.org">cope_webmanager@publicationethics.org</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="SAR" id="SAR"></a>8) SUBJECT ACCESS REQUEST (SAR)</h3>
<p>8.a What is a subject access request (SAR)?</p>
<p>An SAR is the name given to the process by which a user can request to know details of the information that a site holds about him or her and how it is being used.

The recipient organisation of an SAR must respond, according to UK law, within 40 calendar days.</p>
