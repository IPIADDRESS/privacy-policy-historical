        <br><br><b>Cookies </b><br>By use of this site, you consent to our use of cookies.  A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Web site. Cookies do not contain any registration information that would personally identify you, as all such data is kept behind our firewall. Nor do cookies allow us to track your usage of other Web sites or the Internet in general.
        

        <br><br><b>Log Files </b><br>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our Web site, track customer site navigation and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
        

        <br><br><b>Sharing </b><br>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that identifies any individual person.  Publix may use your profile information (such as the number of people in your household, the number of pets you have, etc.) to create personalized content, offers, services, and advertising, but this information will only be used by Publix and its affiliates. Publix and its affiliates may release information when required to do so by law (for example, under a subpoena, court order or other regulatory requirement or to maintain or protect the security of the site).
        

        <br><br><b>Security</b><br>Publix uses secure connections during the transmission of pharmacy refill transactions and in the Preschool Pals section of our site - specifically, with regard to Preschool Pals, those pages dealing with sign in, registration and membership information. This means that information collected during the transmission of pharmacy refill transactions and in the Preschool Pals section of our site is encrypted before it is sent over the Internet between your computer and Publix computers. The technology used is called Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Through the use of this technology, your information collected during the transmission of pharmacy refill transactions and in the Preschool Pals section of our site is encrypted on your computer, sent through the Internet as jumbled code and decoded on Publix's secure server. You can verify that the connection is secure because you will see a key or a padlock at the bottom of your browser. Another identifier of a secure connection is the URL (or Web site address); the address will change from <i>http://www.publix.com</i> to <i>https://www.publix.com</i> when a secure connection is in place.
        

        <br><br><b>Surveys and Contests</b><br>From time to time, Publix or its affiliates may conduct online surveys that ask you for demographic data, such as your ZIP code, age or income level. Publix or Publix's agents may also contact you by telephone or e-mail, using your phone number or e-mail address collected when you filled out one of the forms described in the "What is Collected, and How Do We Use It" section of this Policy, with the option to participate in consumer research studies. Participation in any survey or other consumer research is always voluntary. Publix aggregates the responses we receive before using the information to improve the products and services we offer. We do not link your individual responses to your personal information at any time.<br><br>Publix may also ask for some personal information, such as names and e-mail addresses, so that we can contact contest winners and to give you the option to participate in consumer research studies. All of these contests and surveys follow applicable federal and state laws. We will clearly post the rules and terms of each contest.
        

        <br><br><b>Links</b><br>Our site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Publix is not responsible for the privacy policies of other sites. We encourage our shoppers to be aware when they leave our Web site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to the information collected by our Web site.
        

        <br><br><b>Notification of Changes</b><br>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
