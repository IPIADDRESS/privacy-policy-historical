<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PublicDomainTreasureHunter.com</font> strives to 
offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an 
interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable 
Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) 
subject to the terms of this privacy policy. </p>
<p><b>How We Gather Information From Users Of This Site</b> </p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 
the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For 
example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to 
certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or 
when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in 
sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive 
areas of our site. Like most Web sites, <font face="Arial" size="2">PublicDomainTreasureHunter.com</font> also collects information automatically and 
through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For 
example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie 
technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other 
things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from 
having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the 
number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our 
site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through 
other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with 
information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, 
but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be 
asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to 
customize the siteâ€™s features according to your preferences. </p>
<p><b>What We Do With The Information We Collect</b> </p>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and 
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and 
do not share your information with anyone. </p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) 
may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your 
usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help 
enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or 
what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be 
shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does 
not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to 
identify you individually. </p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on <font face="Arial" size="2">PublicDomainTreasureHunter.com</font> to communicate 
with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of 
Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by <font face="Arial" size="2">PublicDomainTreasureHunter.com</font> and other topics 
we think you might find of interest. </p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by <font face="Arial" size="2">PublicDomainTreasureHunter.com</font> may also be used for other purposes, 
including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of 
e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other 
communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for 
the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such 
information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, 
from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, 
merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user 
information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your 
information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are 
reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of 
amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we 
deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice 
prior to disclosure in such cases. </p>
<p><b>Affiliated Sites, Linked Sites &amp; Advertisements</b> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PublicDomainTreasureHunter.com</font> expects its 
partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be 
aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, 
affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have 
their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, 
during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a <font face="Arial" size="2">PublicDomainTreasureHunter.com</font> page, certain 
content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through <font face="Arial" size="2">PublicDomainTreasureHunter.com</font> you may be 
introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests 
or sweepstakes offered by other parties. <font face="Arial" size="2">PublicDomainTreasureHunter.com</font> is not responsible for the actions or 
policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies 
of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated 
by a third party. </p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third 
parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your 
preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our 
advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the 
advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. 
Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third 
parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. <font face="Arial" size="2">PublicDomainTreasureHunter.com</font> does not control 
the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is 
not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. </p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally 
Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information 
can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without 
our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or 
third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of <font face="Arial" size="2">PublicDomainTreasureHunter.com</font> and this policy.
</p>

right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for 
changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to 
these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to 
the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that 
applied at the time the information was collected. </p>
<p><b>Governing Law</b> </p>
<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Texas law. If a dispute 
arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the help of a 
mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Atlanta, GA. Any costs 
and fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be shared 
equally by each of us. </p>

mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the 
following location: Atlanta, GA, under the rules of the American Arbitration 
Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered 
in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
