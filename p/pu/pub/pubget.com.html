<h1>Commitment to privacy</h1>

<p class="nav">Posted on January 3, 2008</p>

<p class="p1">We at Pubget, Inc. ("Pubget") respect your privacy. We
collect only information that we consider important for bringing you
this service, and wherever possible deidentify that information so
that it cannot be used to identify you personally. Details are set out
below, but check back frequently: we reserve the right to change this
policy at any time and without notice; changes will take effect 30
days after they have been posted. The date posted can be found at the
top.</p>


<h2>Information we do not collect</h2>

<p>Pubget does not collect the username(s) and/or password(s) that
you may use for logging in to an institution such as a university,
hospital, or library.</p>

<p>In fact, the iframe system that Pubget uses makes it impossible for
Pubget to even see these usernames and passwords, much less collect
them. Such information is generally provided as part of an independent
agreement between you and your institution(s). Pubget <b>respects</b>
such agreements and makes no attempt to collect this information. We
also make no attempt to collect PDFs or other information transmitted
to you from publishers.</p>


<h2>Information we do collect</h2>

<p>Pubget's mission is to help you access the resources you need. To
do this, we issue you a username and password so that you can keep
track of your search histories and keepers and keep those and other
aspects of your account private. We collect logs of searches and
viewed results that contain information about what platform and
browser you are using as well as time stamps and IP addresses, as is
standard on the Internet. We also use cookies, but only for
authentication.</p>


<h2>How collected information is used</h2>

<p>We use the information that we collect in order to improve the
value of the service. We analyze logs and search patterns in order to
monitor, maintain, and improve our performance and to increase the
relevance of the information we provide. The logs that we analyze do
not contain personal identification information such as usernames, and
we make no attempt to link them with the identities of individual
users.</p>

<p>We retain the right to share results of our analyses with third
parties in order to improve the value of the service and the relevance
of the information we provide. However, we do not sell, rent, loan,
trade, or lease personal identification information, including
emails. By using Pubget, you are agreeing unambiguously that we can
collect, keep, and use this information for these purposes. If you
disagree, please do not use Pubget.</p>

<p>Finally, we may of course be compelled to provide information as
the result of a subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process, in
compliance with federal law or state law of Massachusetts.</p>


<h2>How we protect your information</h2>

<p>To protect your privacy, we collect and store information on
secured and backed-up servers. We ask you for an email address so that
we can keep you informed about Pubget and about issues relating to
your account. In addition, we configure our list server software to
refuse to divulge the email addresses of our list subscribers to
anyone but authorized Pubget staff, including other list
subscribers.</p>


<h2>Questions about this policy</h2>

<p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate
to <a mailto:"team@pubget.com"="">contact us</a>.</p>
