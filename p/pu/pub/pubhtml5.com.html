                         While we do not anticipate it, every business nowadays should  plan for the possibility that it might sell certain or all of its assets to  another company or individual, or that it might buy certain assets of another  company or individual. If all or part of the company is sold, merged or  otherwise transferred to another entity, the personal information you have  provided to us may be transferred as part of that transaction. However, we will  take steps to ensure that your personal information is used in a manner  consistent with the provisions of our Policy.<br>
                         Other than those who act on our behalf and except as explained  in this Policy, information you provide at these Sites will not be transferred  to unrelated third parties, unless we have your permission to do so.

                        <li class="recentcomments">I downloaded and installed it win 7 64-bit with no problems. works well. I am very impressed by my first view of this software and will certainly consider buying it.</li>
                        <li class="recentcomments"> I found it difficult to find a digital publishing company that could provide me with live technical support with their software. Then I found PUB html5! I don’t have time to waste which is why getting someone on the phone my first try was so important. They are fast over there. I found a great digital Catalog &amp; Magazine software program that had equally impressive customer service. I definitely recommend this software to anyone looking for fast and high quality service.</li>
                        <li class="recentcomments">Thanks! I have been looking for a program like this for a long time, wanting to make a cool catalog for my website.</li>
