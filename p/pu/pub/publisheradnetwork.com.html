<div id="smaller_text">
    <p>
        <span class="capitalized">Publisher Ad Network</span> ("us," "we" or "our"), as the owner and operator of the <span class="capitalized">PublisherAdNetwork.com</span> website,
        www.publisheradnetwork.com (the "Site" or "Website") created this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") as part of our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of the
        privacy and security of the users ("you" or "your") of the Site. This Privacy Policy will advise you about how we protect your Personal Information (defined below). We urge you to read
        this Privacy Policy carefully. If you visit or use the Site, it means you have accepted the privacy practices described in this Policy.
    </p>

    <p>1. <span class="underline">Privacy Policy</span>.</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to the use of the Site and other services owned and operated by us ("Services"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of unaffiliated sites to which
        our Site only links. Once you enter another website (whether through an advertisement, service, or content link), be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those
        other websites. This Privacy Policy covers information collected on the Site, as well as any information collected by us through other means, such as direct mail, paper applications,
        submitted forms, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update or modify this Privacy Policy. We will post any such changes, updates or modifications ("Change") on the
        Site. Any Change will be effective immediately upon posting, so please check back regularly. Although not required to, we may notify you by email if there is a Change. If we change our
        information practices or this Privacy Policy in such a way that your Personal Information may be used or shared in a manner not described in this Privacy Policy at the time you provided
        the information, you may provide us notice (at the address below) that you would like to opt-out of having your Personal Information used or shared in that new manner.
    </p>

    <p class="capitalized">If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, then do not use this website or our services.</p>

    <p>2. <span class="underline">Types of Information Collected</span>.</p>

    <ol class="lower_alpha">
        <li>
            <em>"Personal Information"</em> is information that can be used to uniquely identify you personally. Examples of personal information include your name, mailing address, telephone
            number, email address and credit card number.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>"Traffic Data"</em> is anonymous information that does not uniquely identify you personally. Examples of Traffic Data include, without limitation, your age, your IP address,
            the type of browser software you use when visiting our website, the date and time you visit our website, and what pages you viewed when visiting our website, as well as other types
            of clickstream data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Traffic Data Collected.</em> We automatically track and collect Traffic Data when you visit our Site, including your: (i) IP address (a set of numbers that is assigned to your
            computer when you are on the Internet); (ii) domain server (a computer that stores website files and provides them to people who request them); (iii) type of computer; and (iv) type
            of web browser. Traffic Data help improve your experience on the Site, including helping diagnose potential problems with equipment, help tailor content to match your preferred
            interests, and help us to otherwise administer the Site.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Personal Information Collected.</em> If you want to access certain advanced features that we offer via the Site, we may ask you to provide us with Personal Information. If you
            communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards or forums, or otherwise complete online forms or surveys, any information provided which could
            be used to identify you uniquely in such communications may be collected as Personal Information. Note: We will only collect Personal Information which you voluntarily provide.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Financial Information Collected.</em> If you want to purchase products or services on the Site, you may be required to submit financial information such as a credit card number
            and billing address ("Financial Data"). We will not sell, share, or rent any of your Financial Data collected except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy or as necessary to fulfill
            your orders.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>3. <span class="underline">Use of Cookies</span>.</p>

    <p>
        As is standard practice on many websites, we collect Traffic Data through the use of "cookie" technology. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser software from a
        web server and is typically stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to monitor use of our Site and improve its quality, e.g., by helping us understand
        which parts of our Site are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies,
        or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) We may from time to time engage
        third parties, who also use cookies, to track and analyze Traffic Data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, we may allow other companies to present advertisements on some pages on our Site, and we may allow those companies to set and access their own cookies on your computer in
        connection with such advertising. Those other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.
    </p>

    <p>4. <span class="underline">Uses of Information Collected</span>.</p>

    <p>
        Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we use your Financial Data only to process your orders; however, we may use all Personal Information you provide for any legal
        purpose, including customer support, required notifications, product and policy updates, newsletters, and marketing releases, as well as to customize and tailor your experiences on
        the Site and displaying content that we think you might be interested in according to your preferences. We may also disclose Personal Information in good faith to third parties to: (a)
        comply with a valid legal inquiry or process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order; (b) protect against a physical or property threat (either intentional or
        unintentional) to you, to others, to us, or to the Site; (c) respond to a breach or attempted breach of the security of our Site; (d) defend or assert our legal rights; (e) enforce our
        Terms of Service; and (f) for other governmental, administrative, regulatory, or law enforcement purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may share Personal Information you provide to us with our affiliates as well as other companies with which we have relationships to complete your request or to provide you with the
        products or services which you have requested. We may also enlist a third party to collect, store, process and manage on our behalf any Personal Information you elect to give us.
        Third parties with whom we conduct business are authorized to use your Personal Information, including Financial Data, only to perform the service for which they are hired. When we use
        other companies to perform services on our behalf, we require that such companies protect your Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <p>
        From time to time we may offer you the opportunity to receive information, product, or services directly from a third party. If you elect to receive such items, we may share with such
        third party any of your Personal Information, including Financial Data, that was collected when you elected to receive such items and which is necessary to facilitate your request to
        receive items from any such third party.
    </p>

    <p>We may process or store your Personal Information in our databases located in the United States or any other country where we or our subsidiaries, affiliates, or agents are located.</p>

    <p>
        You can visit some portions of our Website without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information to us. During your visit, we may collect certain Traffic Data, e.g., we
        may track the number of visitors to our website by logging their Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We may keep track of what pages are visited on our website so we can monitor the
        performance and usage of our website. Also, we may pay attention to what visitors do and do not use on our website to assess its effectiveness and we may modify our content or design
        appropriately. Traffic Data may be used individually or aggregated with other Traffic Data. To the extent that we collect any Traffic Data, such information shall be solely owned by us,
        and we may use the data for any lawful business purpose without a duty of accounting to you, including, without limitation, analyzing and enhancing our Services, disclosing such Traffic
        Data to third parties for a variety of purposes, including demographic and statistical information regarding use of our Site, provided that the Traffic Data are used only in an aggregated
        form without specifically identifying you.
    </p>

    <p>
        In some of our email messages we may use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the Site. When our customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving
        at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you
        prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.
    </p>

    <p>5. <span class="underline">Data Integrity and Security</span>.</p>

    <p>
        We are committed to protecting the information we collect from you and have security measures in place to reasonably protect such information. For example, we store Personal Information
        you provide on computer systems with limited access. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through
        the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, an industry-standard security measure. Only authorized employees and partners are permitted to access your Personal
        Information, and they may do so for permitted business functions only. Although we use reasonable efforts to secure network communications, the Site, and your Personal Information, we
        cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us by e-mail or via our Website, and you do so at your own risk.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please also remember that you play a valuable part in security as well. Your password to access to relevant portions of our Site should never be shared with anyone and should be changed
        frequently. Remember that any information you voluntarily disclose on-line in any news or message postings, discussion groups or chat rooms may be collected and used by others without
        your permission. Furthermore, if you provide any information to parties who operate websites that are linked to or from our Website you may be disclosing Personal Information, and
        different rules may apply to their collection, use, or disclosure of Personal Information. We encourage you to review these websites' policies before revealing any Personal Information
        or other sensitive information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, terms of use, or the content of these websites.
    </p>

    <p>
        Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. While we strive to protect your information by employing reasonable internet
        security methods and practices, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us over an unsecured Internet connection.
    </p>

    <p>6. <span class="underline">Children</span>.</p>

    <p>
        The Site is not directed at individuals less than thirteen (13) years of age, and we do not intend to collect any Personal Information from such individuals, unless otherwise stated at
        the time such information is collected. If a child under 13 submits Personal Information to us and we learn that such Personal Information is the information of a child under 13, we
        will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <p>7. <span class="underline">Your California Privacy Rights</span>.</p>

    <p>
        Residents of the State of California, under certain provisions of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all
        third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has
        a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with
        information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. We have opted for the alternative option and therefore provide you with the opportunity to opt-out or opt-in to the use
        of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of third parties that received your Personal
        Information for marketing purposes.
    </p>
