                        <li><strong>Authorized service providers</strong>: We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data, providing marketing analysis, and supporting our web site functionality.&nbsp; These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Business partners</strong>: We may collect, sell, or share any personal information you enter on our web site or provide to us in some other manner, including via e-mail marketing. We may also work with other businesses to bring select retail opportunities to our users via e-mail marketing campaigns by us, or our partner web sites/co-brands, or our marketing partners, including affiliated third party advertisers. The other businesses we work with may include: (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; and (c) telemarketers. When you open, preview or click on the advertising portion of our e-mails and/or those of our marketing partners and/or affiliates, you have agreed to the terms set forth in our Privacy Policy, and agree that as a function of opening, previewing or clicking on the advertising portion of our e-mails, you will receive new or additional marketing communications from us, our marketing partners and/or affiliates. These e-mail campaigns may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with the e-mail marketing material. There are a number of places on our web site and in e-mail campaigns where you may click on a link to access other web sites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. These third-party web sites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those web sites.

Unsubscribing from one list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all lists.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other Situations</strong>. We also may disclose your information:</li>

In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</li>
                            <li>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or  take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our web site terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</li>
                            <li>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

                    <p>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the web sites of those third parties.  These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.<br>
                    <u>Aggregated and non-personal information</u>. We reserve the right to provide aggregate or group data about PublicBackgroundChecks.com users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage, or characteristics of PublicBackgroundChecks.com participants as a group, without disclosing personally identifiable information. By opening a PublicBackgroundChecks.com account, you agree to allow PublicBackgroundChecks.com to provide such aggregate data to third parties. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when PublicBackgroundChecks.com, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.</p>

                    The information contained in our reports comes from proprietary sources and third party suppliers, and is beyond our control to edit, modify, or change.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such information.</p>

                    <p><a name="f" id="f"></a><strong>6. Your choices about collection and use of your  information</strong> <br>
                    You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may  result in you being unable to use certain features of our web site because such information may be required in order for you to have personalized recommendations presented to you; register as a user; purchase products or services; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our web site.<br>
                    At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional e-mails or newsletters from us by unsubscribing.&nbsp; In every marketing e-mail communication we send, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from that specific marketing program by simply clicking the hyperlink provided and following the instructions provided. We attempt to process all such unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion. However, after unsubscribing, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another marketing mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into.  We can guarantee, however, that if you should ever receive another e-mail marketing communication from us, you will be able to remove your e-mail address via the unsubscribe hyperlink. Unsubscribing from one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all marketing lists. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as  service announcements and administrative notices, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</p>
                    <p><a name="g" id="g"></a><strong>7. How we protect your personal information</strong><br>
                    We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from  unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. When users submit information at our web site, their information is protected both online and offline. The privacy of your personal information is very important to us and access to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. The servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure physical environment.  We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer Software ("SSL") to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised  that, although we take every reasonable technological precaution available to  protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant that your information will be absolutely secure and any transmission of data at or through our web site is at your own risk. <br>
                    Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's web site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for  information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.<br>
                    To the extent that user credit card-specific information (or alternate user  payment method information, such as PayPal, Google Check-Out, etc.) is  collected by PublicBackgroundChecks.com and any of its partners and affiliates, this information will be kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without the user's prior informed  consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PublicBackgroundChecks.com and its affiliates  and/or subsidiaries reserve the right to share with third parties the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific users but we will not share the specific credit card information with third parties without the user's prior informed consent.<br>

                                While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do
                                everything in our power to protect user information offline. All of our users' information,
                                not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
                                Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access
                                to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected
                                screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their
                                password to re-gain access to your information. Finally, the servers that we store
                                personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
