			Welcome to Pubslush.

		</p>

		<p>
			By using Pubslush you understand and agree that we, Pubslush, are providing a platform for you to post content (“User Content”) to Pubslush and to share User Content publicly.  This means that other users may, in certain circumstances, see, use, search for, or share your Use Content that you make publicly available through Pubslush 
		</p> 

		<p>
			Our Privacy Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access Pubslush (collectively, “Users”).
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Your consent.</b> When using our Service, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. 
				</p>
					
				<p>
					<b>Questions.</b> If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, contact our privacy team at <a href="mailto:hello@pubslush.com">hello@pubslush.com</a>.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					<b>Privacy.</b> This Privacy Policy relates only to Pubslush. It does not, however, apply to entities that Pubslush does not own or control, such as Facebook and Twitter. 
				</p>
			</li>

			

			<li>
				<h2>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Browsing Pubslush.</b> You can view Submissions and User comments without creating a Pubslush account.  
				</p>
					
				<p>
					<b>Creating an account and logging in.</b> For some activities on Pubslush, such as posting a Submission, posting a User comment, or Funding a Submission (see below), you will need to set up an account on Pubslush and log in to our Service. When you sign up for a Pubslush account, you provide us with your name, email, password, date of birth (or a certification that you are over the age of 13), location and gender. Some of this information, for example, your name, is listed publicly on Pubslush. 
				</p>
					
				<p>
					<b>Additional personal information that we collect from Authors.</b> If you are a Campaigner, and wish to have the ability to post Submissions, you will be required to provide additional information. That information may include the following: your legal name (although only your first name and first initial of your last name will be viewable to other Users of the site), other biographical information, a personal photograph, your manuscript and other supporting information. Upon completion of a successful Fundraising Campaign, we will contact Campaigners to request their account information for payment via ACH Wire Transfer or Check. Providing this additional information is optional for Users that are not Campaigners. 
				</p>
					
				<p>
					<b>Content.</b> Our Service is primarily designed to enable Campaigners to find an audience for their works. By enabling Submissions and User comments, we create a forum for the Campaigner to do just that. Any Content posted to the site, including Submissions and User comments are collected and saved by Pubslush. 
				</p>
					
				<p>
					<b>Communications.</b> Finally, Pubslush may collect communications between you and Pubslush, such as emails sent from Pubslush regarding account verification, changes and/or updates to features of Pubslush, technical and security notices. Please note that Pubslush allows users the option of opting out of such emails.
