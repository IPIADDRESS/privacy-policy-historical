<b>Your personal details are never given to a third party without 
   your express and explicit permission.</b>
<br><br>
</p><ul>
<li>We will never sell or give your email address to third parties 
unless you say so.<br>
</li><li>All functionality and services that use your information are fully 
"opt-in". You only receive information you explicitly 
ask for, from PubSub. This will not change unless you indicate otherwise.<br>
</li><li>We will not share your personal information with anyone, including 
another PubSub user, unless you ask for this to be done.<br>

<b>Privacy FAQs and Other Questions</b><br>
<a name="5a"></a><br>
What personal details does PubSub need to know? <br>
<ul>
<li>The only information we need to know is your username, password 
and email address. This is collected so that we can validate that 
you are who you say you are. <br>
</li></ul>
<a href="#top"><font size="-2">[return to top]</font></a><br>
<a name="5b"></a><br>
When is my information given out?<br>
<ul>
<li>Your information is never given out, unless you explicitly ask for 
this to be done.<br>
</li></ul>
<a href="#top"><font size="-2">[return to top]</font></a><br>
<a name="5c"></a><br>
How are my personal details used?<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Registration<br><br>
In order to use this service, you must first complete the registration 
process. During registration, you are required to give your email 
address, and choose a username and password. We use this information 
to verify you have entered your own email address by sending a confirmation 
email that activates the account. We will not share this information 
with third-parties without your permission.<br><br>
</li><li>Analysis of aggregated information<br><br>
PubSub may analyze aggregated information 
in order to understand the volumes of usage over time and traffic 
patterns. The information analyzed is not personally identifiable. 
It helps us to judge what changes we need to make to the service 
to support it as it grows.<br><br>
</li><li>Legal Disclaimer<br><br>
In exceptional circumstances, we may 
need to disclose personal information when required by law to comply 
with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or a legal process 
served on our Web site.<br><br>
</li></ul>

<p><a href="#top"><font size="-2">[return to top]</font></a><br>
<a name="5d"></a><br>
Does PubSub sell my information to third parties?<br><br>
</p><ul>
<li>No. We do not sell, give or exchange 
your information with anyone else unless you say we can.
</li></ul>

            <p><a href="#top"><font size="-2">[return to top]</font></a><br>
<a name="5e"></a><br>
Is your service secure?<br><br>
</p><ul>
<li>PubSub uses a number of security 
features to ensure that malicious users are not able to gain access 
to your information. This includes encryption methods for sending 
information over the web, similar to that used by banks. Our servers 
are also locked within a secured building, giving access to only 
specific PubSub employees.
</li></ul>
            <p><a href="#top"><font size="-2">[return to top]</font></a><br>
<a name="5f"></a><br>
Will I be added to any mailing texts?<br><br>
</p><ul><li>No. Again, PubSub will never divulge any information to mailing 
texts unless you ask us explicitly to do so.
</li></ul>
            <p><a href="#top"><font size="-2">[return to top]</font></a><br>
<a name="5g"></a><br>
Do you send unsolicited emails?<br><br>
</p><ul><li>You will receive emails from PubSub on very rare occasions. We send 
all new members a welcoming email to verify that they are who they 
say they are.
<br><br>
</li><li>Service improvement information will be sent via email. We will 
not send any 3rd party marketing material to users in email, unless 
a user has requested such information. On rare occasions it is necessary 
to send out a service related announcement. For instance, if our 
service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users 
an email alert. We may from time to time alert users to new functionality 
available to them within the application. Other messages people 
may receive from time to time include:
<br><br>
- Updates to software<br><br>
- New services<br><br>
- Messages people have requested to receive<br>
</li></ul>

What do you use cookies for?<br><br>
</p><ul><li>A cookie is a piece of data sent by us as part of responses to your 
browser's requests and may be stored on your computer by your browser. 
In order to enhance privacy and security we use cookies to ensure 
that other sites cannot see your information in referrer records. 
We store a cookie on your machine to identify you when you use PubSub 
services. This means you do not have to input your username and 
password every time you use PubSub.<br><br>
</li><li>In order for us to measure volumes and usage of the system, we 
use two types of 'cookies'. These also enable us to make better 
estimations about the infrastructure required to support the service 
as it grows. Your cookie can be read only by servers in the domain 
from which the cookie was sent. We use both 'session' cookies and 
'persistent' cookies. Session cookies are stored on your machine 
while you use the site in order to make it possible for you to use 
the service efficiently, and are deleted once you close your browser 
software. Persistent cookies stay on your machine and will contain 
information about when and how often the service is used. You will 
be able to access all services even if you choose to reject cookies 
by changing the settings in your browser.
<br><br>
            Log Files
<br><br>
We will also use log files to record all activity on our servers. 
We do this to detect attempts to attack the system. We also do this 
so we can study the logs and understand usage of the system and 
to enhance service in the future. Technical data held in log files 
includes your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider 
("ISP"), referring/exit Web pages, computer platform type, 
date/time stamp, and user activity. PubSub uses the log data to 
administer the Services and the Site and gather broad usage information 
for aggregate use.

<a name="5i"></a><br>
How do you notify me of any changes?<br><br>
</p><ul>
<li>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
to this privacy statement on the homepage, and other places we deem 
appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we 
collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we 
may disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the 
privacy policy under which the information was collected.
</li></ul>

<a name="5j"></a><br>
How do I cancel my account?<br><br>
</p><ul><li>You can cancel your membership by sending an email to <a href="mailto:cancel@PubSub.com">info@pubsub.com</a>. 
If a user deactivates their account, that user's information is 
deleted from our machines immediately. However, customer records 
may still exist on back-up tapes, but PubSub will never intentionally 
restore your data to an operational status once you have cancelled 
your account.
</li></ul>
            <p><a href="#top"><font size="-2">[return to top]</font></a><br>
<a name="5k"></a><br>
How do I contact you?<br><br>
</p><ul>
<li>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, 
please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@PubSub.com">info@pubsub.com</a>
<br><br>
For any other information, please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@PubSub.com">info@pubsub.com</a>
