                </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>We need this information to  provide goods and services that you request from our Web site and to let you  know of additional goods and services about which you might be interested. &nbsp;We also use this information to customize your  experience using our Web site.</p>

                        <li>Government Agencies</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We may ask you for personally-identifying  information at other times, such as if you enter into a promotion, post information,  register for a forum, complete a survey, or otherwise communicate with us. &nbsp;If you opt-in to receive information regarding  a promotion or other service, you give us your permission to share your name  and e-mail address with the third party offering the promotion or other service.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we automatically  gather general statistical information about our Web site and visitors, such as  IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services  purchased, etc., but in doing so we do not reference you by individual name,  e-mail address, home address, or telephone number. &nbsp;We use this data in the aggregate to determine  how much our users use parts of our site so we can improve our site. &nbsp;We may provide this statistical information to  third parties, but when we do so we do not provide personally-identifying  information without your permission.</p>
                    <p>As part of our service, we use  cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. &nbsp;Some features of our site may be available  only through the use of a cookie. &nbsp;A  cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server  and stored on your computer's hard drive. &nbsp;Generally, we use cookies to remind us who you  are and enable us to access your account information so you do not have to  re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by registered or  unregistered users to research visiting patterns and to help target  advertisements based on user interests; assist our retail partners track visits  and process orders; and track progress and participation in promotions and  other services. &nbsp;Preference and options  configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. &nbsp;You can change those configurations on your  computer if you desire. &nbsp;By changing your  preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is  sent, or you can reject all cookies. &nbsp;If  you do so and cookies are disabled, you may be required to re-enter your  information more often and certain features of our site may be unavailable.</p>
                    <p>In addition, our retail partners,  advertisers, and other third parties appearing at our site or linked to our  site may use their own cookies and may collect personally-identifiable  information, including credit card information, in connection with your use of  their Web sites.&nbsp; The privacy policy of such  third parties may differ from ours. &nbsp;We  encourage you to read the third party’s privacy policy before responding to the  offer to determine how the personally-identifiable information is used  by that third party </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>The Way We Use Information</b><br>
                    <p>We use your  personally-identifying information to improve our marketing and promotional  efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and  product offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, and services.</p>
                    <p>We may use your information to  deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests,  such as articles, targeted banners, new services, advertisements, and  promotions. &nbsp;You can opt out of receiving  this information by so indicating in your registration/preferences file or  otherwise notifying us in writing. &nbsp;We  may ask you to provide us voluntarily with additional information regarding  your personal or business interests, experience, or requests, which we may use  to customize our services for you.</p>
                    <p>We may use your e-mail address,  your mailing address, and phone number to contact you regarding administrative  notices and communications relevant to your use of our site.</p>
                    <p>If you place a request for  products or services, we use your information to deliver your order.&nbsp; Payments for products and services ordered  from us through our site are handled by a third-party provider.&nbsp; This provider, as well as other providers, may  collect additional information, including billing information, credit card  number and expiration date, and tracking information from checks or money  orders.&nbsp; If you obtain goods or services directly  from one of our retail partners or service providers, we may exchange with the  vendor personally-identified information about you for purposes of your transaction.</p>
                    <p>We may also use or disclose  information to resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Web Site User  Agreement. &nbsp;At times, we may review the status  or activity of multiple users to do so. &nbsp;We  may disclose or access information whenever we believe in good faith that the  law so requires or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain  service and improve our products and services.</p>
                    <p>We use your IP address to help  diagnose problems with our server, to manage our Web site, and to enhance our  site based on the usage pattern data we receive.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Security</b><br>
                    <p>We employ reasonable and current  security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and  ensure correct use of information.</p>
                    <p>To use some of our services, you  may be required to set up a password-protected account or profile on our Web  site. &nbsp;We recommend that you do not  divulge your password to anyone. &nbsp;It is  your responsibility to keep your password protected.&nbsp; Our personnel will never ask you for your  password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. &nbsp;Remember to sign out of your account, close your  browser window, and delete your temporary Internet files when you have finished  your session. &nbsp;This helps ensure that  others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share  a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place where others  may have access to it.</p>
                    <p>Whenever you voluntarily disclose  personal information online -- for example, on message boards, through e-mail  or in chat areas -- that information can be collected and used by others.</p>
                    <p>No data transmission over the  Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. &nbsp;As a result, while we try to protect your  personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any  information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>How You Can Update, Correct or Delete Your  Information</b><br>
                    <p>You can access the information  that we collect online and maintain through normal updating methods. &nbsp;To update, correct, or delete this  information, you can contact us via e-mail at website@publicschoolworks.com,  by fax at 513-631-6888, or by phone at 513-631-6111.&nbsp; During the normal course of doing business,  we will continue to share your information among our business units, our  affiliates and unaffiliated third parties as necessary in order to service your  accounts and fill any orders you place with us.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Children Under 13</b><br>
                    <p>We have no way of distinguishing  the age of individuals who access our Web site, and so we carry out the same Privacy  Policy for individuals of all ages. &nbsp;If a  child has provided us with personally-identifying information without parental  or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the  information and opt out of promotional opportunities or other applicable  services.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Changes to Our Policy</b><br>
                    <p>Any changes to our Privacy Policy  will be communicated through our Web site at least 30 days in advance of its effective  date. &nbsp;Information collected before  changes are made will be secured according to the previous Privacy Policy.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Your Consent</b><br>
                    <p>By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this  information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
