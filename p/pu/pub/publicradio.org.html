                    Public Radio (MPR). We recognize the importance of privacy

                    to know how we collect and use information about you when

                    when you visit MPR Web sites <br>
                    </b> Like virtually all other Web servers, MPR's Web server 
                    automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses 
                    our site. These "access logs" allow us to make our 
                    site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do not record 
                    a visitor's name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, 
                    or any other personally identifying information. Rather, these 
                    log files may contain some or all of the following information: 
                    <br>
                    • The date of the visit <br>
                    • The time and length of the visit <br>
                    • The path taken through the Web site<br>
                    • The browser being used<br>
                    • A list of files downloaded or viewed <br>
                    • The amount of time spent listening to audio files 
                    <br>
                    • The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the 
                    machine accessing our Web site* <br>
                    • Any errors encountered<br>
                    <i>*Most Internet Service Providers use a "dynamic" 
                    form of assigning IP Addresses. This means that a visitor 
                    may have a different IP address each time he or she visits 
                    an MPR Web site. Also, many Internet Service Providers, including 
                    America Online, use "proxy servers," which provide 
                    even more anonymity for visitors.</i></p>
                <p>We use this information to aid the technical administration 
                    of the sites and to better understand how each site is functioning 
                    for its users. This information may be correlated with your 
                    profile, if you have provided this data, to provide special 
                    "personalized" services. This information may also 
                    be used in aggregate form. </p>
                <p>We may track your visit to sections of our Web sites in order 
                    for some site features to function properly for you. In some 
                    instances, "cookies" or a similar technology may 
                    be used to update your registration records with session information. 
                    If you do not wish to accept a cookie from MPR's servers, 
                    you can adjust the settings on your browser accordingly. Refusing 
                    to accept cookies from the MPR server may result in some limits 
                    on the benefits that we can automatically provide as you enjoy 
                    the MPR Web sites.</p>
                <p><b><a name="voluntary"></a>Information you give us <br>
                    </b> MPR does not collect personally identifying information 
                    from MPR Web sites unless you choose to provide that information 
                    to us. Visitors under the age of 13 must obtain permission 
                    from their parents or guardians before sending any personally 
                    identifying information to MPR. </p>

                        </b> MPR may ask visitors (you) to provide certain personal 
                        information when you: register for a contest; sign up 
                        for an e-mail list; request information; purchase products 
                        or services; contribute material that may be used on the 
                        Web site (e.g., recipes or program reviews); participate 
                        in a discussion board or chat; or use an MPR form to become 
                        a member of MPR. You will also have the opportunity to 
                        request future e-mail contact from MPR regarding its programs 
                        and Web sites. MPR tells you whether a specific piece 
                        of information is required at the time it is requested. 
                    </p>
                    <p>This information may be used by MPR to: verify your identity; 
                        manage a contest; gather your editorial comments and feedback; 
                        contact you for additional information or administrative 
                        purposes; provide attribution for any submitted content 
                        of yours published by MPR, and fulfill your order or request. 
                        If you opt-in to request future contact from MPR, you 
                        may receive e-mail regarding its programs and Web sites; 
                        otherwise, MPR will contact you only if necessary for 
                        the purposes above.. </p>
                    <p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise at the time of submission, 
                        the personally identifying information you provide will 
                        not be sold, shared, or used for purposes other than listed 
                        above. If MPR does wish to add your information to a shared 
                        list, it will do so only if you provide permission when 
                        you submit your information-by default, your information 
                        will not be added; you must "opt-in."</p>
                    <p>MPR uses shared lists to maximize the benefits it can provide 
                        through its network of public radio Web sites and through 
                        qualified associations. If you allow it, your name and 
                        basic contact information may be exchanged for consideration 
                        with select companies and organizations, including with 
                        other public radio stations and programs. These companies 
                        and organizations may attempt to contact you to promote 
                        a product or service that they offer. Such contacts from 
                        third parties will only be made with MPR's consent, and 
                        MPR will only grant its consent when MPR considers the 
                        offer to be of potential interest and benefit to our Web 
                        site users.</p>
                    <p>MPR will not share, exchange, rent, or sell any of its 
                        lists to political parties or candidates for political 
                        office.</p>
                    <p>If you do not want your name and contact information to 
                        be used in this way, you may indicate this at the time 
                        you provide the information. If you decide after you have 
                        provided this information that you do not want MPR to 
                        share your information with any company or organization, 
                        you may also notify us by e-mailing <a href="mailto:mail@mpr.org">mail@mpr.org</a>. 
                        MPR cannot remove your name from any third party's list;
