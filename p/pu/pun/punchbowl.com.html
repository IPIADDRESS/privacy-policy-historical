<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

<p>Like most websites, <em>Punchbowl Software</em> uses "cookies" to allow you to bypass the login screen ("Remember Me" functionality). A cookie is a tiny data file, which resides on your computer and allows <em>Punchbowl Software</em> to recognize you as a member when you return to <strong>Punchbowl</strong> from the same computer and browser. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, when you register with <strong>Punchbowl</strong>, a cookie helps <em>Punchbowl Software</em> to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to <strong>Punchbowl</strong>, the information you previously provided can be retrieved. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the <strong>Punchbowl</strong> services.</p>

<h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>
