              to us (i.e. sending an e-mail, participation in a survey, responding 
              to a feedback or "contact us" form, etc.) Government departments, 
              agencies and organisations may request personally identifiable information 
              from you in order to provide requested services however, such information 
              is handled as in the case of an in-person visit to that same department,

              that contains personally identifying information, or fill out a 
              form that e-mails us information, we will use this personally identifying 
              information only to respond to your request. We may redirect your

              We take very seriously the integrity of the information and systems 
              that we maintain. Hence, appropriate safeguards have been employed 
              to ensure that any personal information is secure from destruction, 
              corruption, unauthorized access and breach of confidentiality.<br>
              <br>
              Several steps have been taken to safeguard the integrity of our 
              computer systems and networks. These steps include, but are not 
              limited to individual authentication, the security of transmitted
