      <h2 class="text-center">About Punchh and the information we collect</h2>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h3>Profile Information submitted by Members to Punchh</h3>
        <p>Punchh is an online community that connects people through the places they visit and helps them discover places around them.. To accomplish this, each Punchh Member creates his or her own profile, which contains a list of places relevant to the member. This personal information includes such things as:</p>

        <ul class="content-section-list">
          <li>First name or first and last names of the Member (depending on the options selected by the Member)</li>
          <li>Location (e.g., city and state), and</li>
          <li>Photos, videos or other shared content uploaded by the Member to his or her profile, to the extent that it includes personal information.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h3>Other Information submitted by Members to Punchh</h3>
        <p>Punchh also collects Member-submitted account information such as name and email address to identify Members, send notifications related to the use of the Punchh service and conduct market research and marketing for Punchh's internal use only.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h3>Information Not Directly Submitted by Members or Other Website Users to Punchh</h3>
        <p>Finally, we may also collect some information from Members, as well as from other visitors to the Punchh website, that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered from all Members and visitors to the website.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-center">Use of Information Obtained by Punchh</h2>
      <div class="content-section"><h3>Display of Members' Information</h3>
        <p>Except where a Member might choose to include a full name in his or her profile, a Member's email address and full name will only be used in the following circumstances:</p>

        <p>When the Member invites a friend via email to become a Punchh Member,
          When the Member sends a request to another Member to add the other Member to his or her friend list,<br>
          When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her use of the Punchh service or Punchh website, and
          If the Member so chooses, when we send regular notifications, weekly updates, or other news regarding the Punchh service or the Punchh website.
          Except when inviting or adding friends or as otherwise expressly set forth herein, a Member's email address will never be shared with or displayed to any other person. Members and their friends, and other Members within their personal networks (depending on the level of sharing a Member has chosen) communicate on Punchh with each other through the Punchh service, without disclosing email addresses.

      </div>

      <div class="content-section">
        <h3>Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</h3>
        <p>Except as explained herein, or where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law or for the protection of your Membership. However, Punchh may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to Members and other users of the Punchh website more targeted advertising, products and services; provided that, in such situations, we will never disclose information that would personally identify you. As set forth above, Punchh may (i) use your email address to conduct market research for Punchh's internal use only; and/or (ii) use your email address to market Punchh to you (e.g., new features and applications, announcements, opportunities of interest). Punchh may contract with a third party to conduct such research and marketing; provided that such third party will be fully bound by an obligation of confidentiality to Punchh and may not use any personally-identifiable information provided by Punchh other than as expressly instructed by Punchh and in strict compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>The Punchh Website contains links to other websites. This includes links that are placed there by Punchh (such as in advertisements), as well as by other Punchh Members. Please be aware that Punchh is not responsible for the privacy practices of any other website. We encourage all Members and other users of the Punchh website to be aware of when they leave our website, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.

        <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
        <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Punchh website. However, we do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any Member or other user of the Punchh website which they did not intentionally submit to us other than as stated in this Privacy Policy. We use both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies." We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

        <h3>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web site so Members and other users of the Punchh website are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use Members' or other users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify those Members and users via email or by placing a prominent notice on our website.</p>

Punchh will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. Punchh stores this email address for the purpose of: (i) automatically adding the respondent to the “friends list” of the Member sending the invitation; (ii) sending reminders of the invitation and (iii) sending emails on recent updates by the Member on Punchh to the Member's invited friend. Punchh will never sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. Any person who receives an invitation may contact Punchh to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>
