      <p class="copy"><span class="copy_bold">Children's Information</span><br>
        Pump It Up recognizes the need to provide additional privacy protection to children. Children 12 years old and younger may visit www.pumpitupparty.com without disclosing any personally identifiable information. However, it is sometimes necessary to collect some personally identifiable information about children in order to allow them to use a feature of our site (like joining the Pump It Up Birthday Club). In addition, be aware that all sites that are targeted to children 12 and younger are prohibited by law from collecting more information than they need. Only a parent or guardian may register a child 12 or younger for the Pump It Up Birthday Club. When a parent registers a child for the Birthday Club, we request the child's name, date of birth and parent's e-mail address. We collect this information in order to verify the child's age, send personalized Birthday Club e-cards, and provide other Birthday Club benefits (such as sweepstakes, newsletters, e-cards and special offers. We require our affiliates and franchisees to respect our privacy practices concerning children's information and not use children's information for purposes other than to carry out our instructions. Parents may request at any time that we delete information about their children from our databases. To do so, as a parent, when an email message is sent to you, select the option to be removed from the Birthday Club entirely.</p>
