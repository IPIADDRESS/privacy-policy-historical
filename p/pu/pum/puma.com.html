Examples of user information that may be collected may include your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit-or debit-card information, a description of the item requested or purchased and the IP address of your computer.</p>
<p>

	Even if you do not make a purchase on our site, we have the ability to track usage of our web site – including the server from which the site was visited. This information is not used to track information about individuals, but is used on an aggregate level to customize our site, improve the on-line experience and plan advertising and promotions. Information Voluntarily Provided<br>
	There are times when you may provide information to us voluntarily. This occurs when you provide your feedback to us though e-mails, return forms, letters or telephone calls. We use this information to respond to your query and to keep track of customer feedback.</p>

We only send marketing information to those customers who specifically sign up for our mailing list. Customers can opt-out of receiving information by using the "unsubscribe" option in any marketing e-mail that they receive or by changing their preferences in the "My Account" section of the site.</p>

	<span class="puma_legal_psubtitle">Transaction Security</span><br>
	In order to make every effort to ensure that your experience at store.puma.com is secure, we use encryption technology to protect you against the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.

<p>
	To be sure you're browsing secure pages for transactions, check your Web browser's status bar (located at the bottom of the window) for the closed padlock icon. This icon appears in your web browser to tell you that you are viewing a secure web page.

We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server.
