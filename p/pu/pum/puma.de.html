<p>
	<strong>Collection And Use Of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>
	PUMA limits its requests for information to what is required to ensure accurate service. Most of the information we collect is very basic and is needed to complete a purchase or provide a refund. Examples of user information that may be collected may include your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit-or debit-card information, a description of the item requested or purchased and the IP address of your computer.<br>

<p>
	<strong>Navigation Information</strong></p>
<p>
	Even if you do not make a purchase on our site, we have the ability to track usage of our web site – including the server from which the site was visited. This information is not used to track information about individuals, but is used on an aggregate level to customize our site, improve the on-line experience and plan advertising and promotions. Information Voluntarily Provided<br>
	There are times when you may provide information to us voluntarily. This occurs when you provide your feedback to us though e-mails, return forms, letters or telephone calls. We use this information to respond to your query and to keep track of customer feedback.<br>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Internet Database</strong></p>
<p>
	PUMA North America has created an Internet database to allow consumers to store their shipping and billing information, track the status of their order, list previous orders and retain email preferences. Registration is entirely voluntary and you have the ability to correct or delete the information at any time. This information is accessed through the "My Account" section of the site.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Marketing Information</strong></p>
<p>
	PUMA does not sell or otherwise share your personal information with anyone else, such as advertising agencies or marketing companies. We only send marketing information to those customers who specifically sign up for our mailing list. Customers can opt-out of receiving information by using the "unsubscribe" option in any marketing e-mail that they receive or by changing their preferences in the "My Account" section of the site.</p>

We will not disclose your personal information to any third party without your written consent unless required to do so by law.</p>

This icon appears in your web browser to tell you that you are viewing a secure web page.
