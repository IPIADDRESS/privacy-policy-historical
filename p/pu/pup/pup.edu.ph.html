              <p>
              PUPWebSite is very much aware in protecting your privacy and personal information. This statement discloses how 
              PUPWebSite helps protect your personal information while using 
              PUPWebSite. This Privacy Statement only applies to PUPWebSite.&nbsp; 
              Other sites that has a link from this site may have a separate 
              privacy statement. Please read the PUPWebSite Privacy Statement 
              carefully.</p>
              <p>PUPWebSite uses PUPWebSite Connect ("Connect") as its 
              registration and authentication service. When you sign-up to 
              Connect, you will be asked to provide your username and a 
              password. This same Connect Account allows you to access many 
              other Connect Services.</p>
              <p>By using PUPWebSite, you consent to the data 
              practices described in this statement.</p>
              <hr>
              <p><b>Collection of  Personal Information</b></p>
              <p>We will ask you when we need information that personally 
            identifies you ("Personal Information") or allows us to contact you. 
            Generally, this information is requested when you sign-up 
            for PUPWebSite Connect; or when you participate in University 
              surveys, which are conducted online.</p>
              <p>As described in greater detail below, we collect and process 
              Personal Information for three major reasons: (1) to operate an 
              authentication service, (2) to facilitate registration at member 
              services that request personal information from you for 
              the purposes intended by the service, and (3) to 
              improve security and provide customer support for your Connect 
              Account.</p>
              <p>We keep this information on file with any information you've 
              already given us on previous visits to PUPWebSite.</p>
              <hr>
              <p><b>Collection of Other Information</b></p>
            <p>Aside from the Personal Information, PUPWebSite also collects certain information about your 
            computer system. This information  includes your 
            (1) IP address, (2) browser type, (3) operating system, (4) domain name, 
            (5) access 
            times, and (6) referring Web site addresses. The collection of these 
            data only occurs every initial access to PUPWebSite.&nbsp; This information is used for 
            the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, 
            and to provide general statistics regarding the use of PUPWebSite.</p>
            <p>PUPWebSite also collects information about which pages you visit within 
            the site. This site visitation data is 
            identified only by a unique ID number, and it is never linked with 
            any Personal Information unless you give your consent, as described below.</p>
              <hr>
              <p><b>Information Collected by PUPWebSite</b></p>
              <p>PUPWebSite collects only that information which is necessary to 
              carry out specific purposes. However, PUPWebSite does not collect 
              any other information not indicated in this clause, whether you are signed in or not from 
              PUPWebSite Connect.</p>
              <p>When you sign-up for a Connect Account, you will be asked to 
              provide certain Personal Information that will be stored in the 
              MyProfile component of Connect. As described below, the amount of 
              information requested contains, at most, the following 
              information: (1) First Name, (2) Middle Name, (3) Last Name, (4) 
              Gender, (5) Status, (6) Birth Date, (7) Home Country, (8) Current 
              Location, (9) Occupation, (10) E-Mail Address, (11) Description, 
              (12) School, (13) College, (14) Field of Study, and (15) Academic 
              Status.</p>
              <p>When you sign-up for your Connect Account, you will be asked to 
              create a username and password. You are also requested to 
              select a secret 
              question and provide a secret answer. You use your secret question and 
              answer to help verify your identity to Connect when there 
              are account issues, such as needing to retrieve your password. </p>
              <p>Connect associates a  unique identifier with 
              every  account at sign-in. The unique identifier 
              is a generated unique encrypted number that Connect uses to all 
              Connect Services when you choose to sign-in. This unique 
              identifier makes it possible for the site to determine whether you 
              are the same person from one sign-in session to the next. Your 
              unique identifier is viewable in Connect &gt; View MyProfile.</p>
              <p>Connect also temporarily logs individual sign-ins for the 
              purpose of ensuring the efficiency and security of the Connect Service. The information in these logs is identified only 
              by the account's unique ID number, and it is never linked with 
              Personal Information. </p>
              <hr>
              <p><b>Collection of Optional Information in MyProfile</b></p>
              <p>Optional Information is also collected in the MyProfile. You 
              have the option to fill-in the information or not.&nbsp; Optional 
              Information includes: (1) Home Information (Address, 
              City/Municipality, Country, State/Province, Zip Code, Contact 
              Number, Fax Number), and (2) Work Information (Company Name, 
              Address, City/Municipality, Country, State/Province, Zip Code, 
              Contact Number, Fax Number).</p>
              <hr>
              <p><b>Use of your Personal Information</b></p>
              <p><b>How PUPWebSite Will NOT Use Your Personal Information<br>
              </b>PUPWebSite will not sell or rent your Personal Information to 
              third parties; and PUPWebSite will not use or share your Personal 
              Information 
              in a manner that differs from what is described in this Privacy 
              Statement without your prior consent. </p>
              <p><b>How PUPWebSite Uses Your Personal Information<br>
              </b>PUPWebSite uses your Personal Information for the operation 
              and maintenance of your Connect Account and the Connect Service. For example, 
              Connect uses your e-mail 
              address to send you a welcome e-mail message when you first 
              sign-up informing you about the Service, telling you how to 
              manage your Connect Account. You will receive a separate 
              e-mail to which you must respond in order to validate that you are 
              the owner of the e-mail address associated with the Connect Account.&nbsp; This process 
              is designed to verify the validity of the e-mail address and to 
              help prevent e-mail addresses from being used without permission 
              in the creation of Connect Accounts. </p>
              <p>PUPWebSite may also send you e-mail about periodic service 
              or  updates. These periodic e-mails are 
              considered essential to the provision of the Services. You cannot unsubscribe from these mailings.</p>
              <p>If you need to retrieve your password, Connect sends it thru 
              your e-mail.</p>
              <hr>
            <p><b>General Disclosure of Information</b></p>
            <p>We collect and use information for the following purposes:</p>
