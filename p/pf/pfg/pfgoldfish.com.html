<b>Our Policy</b><br>
At our site, we don't collect personally-identifiable information from
individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly.  This
means we don't require you to register or provide information to us in order
to view our site. If you register in order to use the "Recipe Box," "<a href="http://www.campbellkitchen.com/mealmail/default.cfm">Meal-mailâ„¢</a>," or "Send
a Recipe to a Friend" features of our site, we use the information you
supply for the purpose of providing the services you've requested. If you
specifically agreed to follow-up contacts by us or asked to be put on our
mailing list when you registered, we may also contact you from time to time.
You can always change your preference for follow-up contacts just by
e-mailing us at any time. We don't share any information you give us with
anyone outside of Campbell Soup Company.</p><p>

We ask for personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, and phone 
number. We use this information only if we need to contact you directly because 
our attempts to contact you by e-mail were unsuccessful. We don't use the information
internally for other purposes, and we don't share it with anyone outside of
Campbell Soup Company.</p><p>

Our site sometimes includes notices of sweepstakes or other promotions we
are conducting, and we may permit you to enter electronically in some cases.
If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of
conducting the promotion (e.g., to contact you if you're a winner). We don't
share the information you give us with anyone outside of Campbell Soup
Company.</p><p>
