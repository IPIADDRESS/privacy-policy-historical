<b>Resale or disclosure of information to third parties:</b>

<b>Browser information collected on our website:</b>

As with any website operator, PFAW analyzes our website logs to constantly improve the value of our website.

It is possible that by fraud or deception by others we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13.  If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from our servers.  If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please do so by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@pfaw.org">webmaster@pfaw.org</a>.
