<p class="normal">
Information gathered from your use of the Services may be combined with information from third-party sources to identify your location by state and region ("Regional Location"), which we may use to serve you appropriate local content and advertising. Certain of our mobile applications also have search functionality that gathers aggregate location data about visitors who are in or near our restaurants, and when visitors opt in, allows us to collect information about their precise geographic location ( "Geo-location"). We may use GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cell tower proximity to determine geo-location. If you agree to have your Geo-location collected, we may use and retain that precise location data to provide you with information about restaurants in your area or carry out marketing and other activities contemplated by our mobile applications and by this Policy. When you have Geo-location software running on your Device, we may <a name="section3"></a>

To better understand your purchasing preferences, we may use third party vendors that use Tracking Technologies that recognize and collect information about your Devices that you may use to connect with our Services and the Internet. When these tools are enabled, the data that we and our third-party service providers collect about these Devices is used to enable advertising or other information across Devices to deliver more relevant information to you, or to measure the effectiveness of our Services and advertising across different Devices. When you access our Services on a specific Device, a unique ID is created for that Device that allows us and our third-party vendors to deliver relevant content and advertising based on your interests gathered across multiple sites and applications. This data may be combined with the same information from another browser or Device if you use multiple browsers or Devices. You may opt-out of this tracking information collection for use in serving interest based ads by going to <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/" class="dark-grey">http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/</a>. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads; you will continue to receive ads that are not customized for you. This opt-out applies to the specific Device/browser combination on which you are browsing. To opt-out of other Device/browser combinations, you will need to opt-out of those as well.

<h3 class="avenir" id="section3">3. ADVERTISING &amp; ANALYTICS SERVICES</h3>
<br>
<p class="bold">Interest-Based Advertising</p>
<p class="normal">We engage third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf and provide analytics services. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies to collect information about your visits over time and across the Services and other third-party web sites, such as your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information, as well as information received from other sources. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and Services, deliver targeted advertising to you and better understand your offline and online activity. We use Google interest based cookies to serve personalized ads to you. To learn more about how Google uses cookies in interest-based advertising, you can visit the Google ad and content network privacy policy <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" class="dark-grey">located here</a>. To opt out of Google interest-based cookies, <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" class="dark-grey" aria-label="Learn more about opting out of Google's interest based cookie">click here</a>. To serve our ads, we also use a variety of third-party advertising service providers, including networks, data exchanges, ad servers, analytics providers and others. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies to send directly to your Device the advertisements and marketing messages that appear on the Services. They automatically receive your Device identifier when this happens. Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same ad and help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. These third parties also may use information gathered from your use of the Services to serve targeted, interest-based advertisements to you on third-party websites and applications. The use of these Tracking Technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Policy. To learn more about our other advertising service providers’ data collection practices,&nbsp;<a href="/info/thirdpartyproviders" class="dark-grey" aria-label="Learn more about our third party advertising services providers">click here</a>. Google and some of the advertising service providers we use may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. If you opt out of receiving targeted ads in this manner, you will continue to receive advertising messages, but they will not be customized to you based on your use of the Services and third-party websites. If you would like more information about advertisers’ use of Tracking Technologies and about your option not to accept them, you can go to <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/" class="dark-grey">www.networkadvertising.org</a>. To learn more about how interest-based information is collected, whether the companies we use are part of an industry network regarding behavioral advertising, or to know your choices about not having information used in this manner, you can go to <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/" class="dark-grey">www.aboutads.info</a>. <br>
You also can prevent your receipt of interest-based ads from us on websites by deleting and declining cookies in your browser(s). Please note that the opt-out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer or mobile application, and browser or operating system, on which the opt-out is applied. Some newer mobile device operating systems allow you to limit the use of information to deliver interest-based advertising in mobile applications. You can check the settings on your Device for such options in your Device's operating system.Alternatively, you may wish to download the Digital Alliance “App Choices” mobile application and follow the instructions provided.</p>

<br>
<p class="bold">Browser “Do Not Track” Signals</p>
<p class="normal">
Some third-party browsers provide “do not track” machine-readable signals for websites, which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors’ choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, we do not respond to these signals.

<br>
<p class="bold">Co-Branded Areas</p>
<p class="normal">
Certain areas on our PFCB Applications may be provided to you in association with third parties (“Co-Branded Areas”). Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party. If you register for the products or services provided at these Co-Branded Areas, either you will be providing your Information to both PFCB and the third party, or we may be providing your Information directly to the third party in order for that third party to fulfill their products and services directly with you. Your Information will be subject to this Policy as well as the privacy policy and practices of such third party.

<p class="normal">
If P.F. Chang’s China Bistro, Inc., or any of its affiliates or businesses, is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, personal information of our users may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction. Information about our customers and users of our Services may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where we or any one of our businesses are seeking financing, investment, or funding.

<br>
<h3 class="avenir" id="section5">5. ACCESS TO MANAGING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

</ul>
<br>
<p class="bold">To “opt out” of receiving Promotional Communications:</p>
<ul class="disc-list">

We may maintain Information for archival or other internal business purposes.
<a name="section6"></a>
<!-- moved up because of padding -->
<br>
<br>
Please note that if you “opt out” of receiving Promotional Communications, you may still receive transactional communications from us, including order confirmations or other administrative information.

<br>
<h3 class="avenir" id="section6">6. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES AND CONTACT INFORMATION</h3>
<br>
<p class="bold">
Links to Other Sites
</p>
<p class="normal">
Our Sites may utilize hyperlinks to access external or third-party sites, which are not controlled by us and, therefore, are not subject to this Policy. We recommend that you check the privacy policies of those third-party sites to determine how the proprietors of those sites will utilize your Information.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">
Security
</p>
<p class="normal">
We implement security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control. However, no system can guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your Information, and your use of Services indicates that you are willing to assume this risk. Nevertheless, credit card security is a high priority and we use SSL encryption software when collecting and transmitting your billing information to our payment processors. If you prefer, we are happy to accept your payment over the phone or in person when you visit one of our restaurants. If you wish to purchase a gift card over the phone, please call us toll free at 1-866-732-4264 and indicate that you wish to purchase a gift card without any information being submitted over the Internet.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">
Storage and Retention.
</p>
<p class="normal">
Information that you provide to us as described in this Policy or through the Services may be gathered and stored in one or more of our corporate databases. We will retain logs and information about you for the purposes set forth in this Policy along with an archival copy of your Information, which might be used by us for record keeping and internal purposes, including enforcing our Terms of Service, complying with law, preventing fraud, assisting with investigations, resolving disputes, analyzing or troubleshooting programs, or take other actions permitted by law.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">
What You Need to Do to Protect Your Information
</p>
<p class="normal">
There are several measures you can take to protect your Information. One option is simply not to volunteer it to us. As stated above, this approach would allow you to still visit our restaurants or access PFCB Applications; however, you will not be able to use all of our Services, including online ordering, purchases, and reservations. The Federal Trade Commission’s site, www.ftc.gov, also offers useful information about how to protect personally-identifiable information provided online or through mobile applications.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">
Children’s Privacy
</p>
<p class="normal">
Services are intended for use by adults. PFCB does not currently market to or create special areas for use by children. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 years. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us, we will delete the child’s personally identifiable information from our files to the extent technologically possible.
</p>
