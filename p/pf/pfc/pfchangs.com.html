<h2 align="center"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h2>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Date Last Modified: August 5, 2009</strong></h3>
<p>
We respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect from you when you visit our websites www.pfchangs.com and www.peiwei.com (collectively, “Websites”) and our restaurants, how we use that information, and under what circumstances we disclose it. It will also give you more information about how to manage the personal information that you provide to us. This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use located on the Websites.<br><br>

<strong>1.	The Information We Collect.</strong><br><br>

When you use our Websites or visit our restaurants, we may receive and collect certain information. The information that we may receive and collect depends on what you do when you visit our Websites or restaurants.<br><br>
</p><blockquote>
<strong>•	Automatically Collected Information. </strong><br><br>

Some information is automatically received and sometimes collected from you when you visit our Websites. This information may include some or all of the following items: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using and the IP address of your Internet Service Provider; the type and version of Internet browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site, the length of your stay and the specific pages, images, video or forms that you access while visiting the site; the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Websites, and if applicable, the search engine that referred you and any search strings or phrases that you entered into the search engine to find this site; and demographic information concerning the country of origin of your computer and the language(s) used by it.<br><br>

We use this information to monitor the usage of our Websites, assess its performance, ensure technological compatibility with your computer, and understand the relative importance of the information provided on our Websites. We may also use this data to conduct statistical analyses on visitors’ usage patterns and other aggregated data.<br><br>

<strong>•	Information Collected via Cookies.</strong><br><br>

“Cookies” are small files or records that are placed on your computer’s hard drive to distinguish you from other visitors to our Websites. The use of cookies is a standard practice among websites to collect or track information about your activities while using our Websites. A cookie may enable the website owner to track how a visitor navigates through its website and the areas in which they show interest. This is similar to a traffic report: it tracks trends and behaviors, but does not identify individuals. Information gathered may include date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent at the site, and the website visited just before and just after a visit to our Websites.<br><br>

Cookies can be set to expire: (1) on a specified date; (2) after a specific period of time; (3) when a transaction has been completed; or (4) when a user turns off his/her Internet browser. A cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor’s Internet browser closes is called a “session” cookie. Cookies that expire based on a time set by the Web server are called “persistent” cookies.<br><br>

Our Websites may use both “session cookies” and “permanent cookies.”  Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit our Websites or most websites because browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie placements. If you refuse cookies, there may be parts of our Websites that may not function properly.<br><br>

<strong>•	Information Collected Using Pixel Tags or Clear GIFs.</strong><br><br>

In the following instances, however, we do need you to actively submit User Information when: (1) you want to contact us via electronic means or website submission; (2) you purchase a gift card or check the balance of a gift card; (3) you utilize online ordering; (4) you utilize online reservations; (5) you enter a contest or sweepstakes; or (6) you join our customer loyalty programs and/or email lists. E-mail or other forms of electronic communication, including website submission, are not secure and/or confidential means of communication.<br><br>

When you click on links on our Websites that take you to third-party websites, you will be subject to the third parties’ privacy policies. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, we cannot be responsible for the actions of any third-party websites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement of any and every website you visit, whether you are linking from our Websites or browsing on your own.<br><br>

<strong>7.	Access to and Managing Your Information.</strong><br><br>

We believe it is important for you to be able to find out what Information you have provided to us through our Websites, update your Information, and “opt out” of receiving future Marketing Communications. <br><br>

<blockquote>
a.	Send an e-mail with your request and current contact information to Privacy@pfcb.com;<br><br>

</blockquote>

If you send an e-mail or letter request, please be sure to include your full name, address, phone number and e-mail address and indicate the specific nature of your request. If you want to “opt in” or “opt out” of receiving Marketing Communications, specifically what type of Marketing Communication (e.g., e-mail or direct mail) you wish to receive or stop receiving. This will ensure we identify you correctly in our systems and accurately process your request. We will take appropriate steps to implement your request, but due to production, mailing and system timelines, it may take up to: 10 business days for e-mails or 30 calendar days for mail. Until that change takes effect, you may still receive or not receive Marketing Communications from us.<br><br>

Also, please note that even though you may have “opted out” of receiving Marketing Communications, you may still receive business-related communications. Please be aware that “opting-out” of certain third party use may prevent us from providing certain services that you request.<br><br>

<strong>8.	What You Need to Do to Protect Your Information.</strong><br><br>

You have several options when deciding how you can best protect your Information. One option is simply not to volunteer it. As stated above, this approach would allow you to still visit our Websites and restaurants – although it will prevent you, for example, from ordering gift cards on-line, providing us with your comments or questions relating to our restaurants, or utilizing online ordering and reservations. The Federal Trade Commission’s website, <a href="http://www.ftc.gov" target="_blank">www.ftc.gov</a>, also offers useful information about how to protect personally identifiable information provided to a website.<br><br>
