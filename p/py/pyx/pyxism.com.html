			Thank you for visiting Pyxism.com (our "Site"). Pyxism appreciates 
			the opportunity to interact with you on the Internet and is 
			committed to protecting and safeguarding your privacy. The purpose 
			of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about the types of 
			information we might collect about you when you visit our Site, how 
			we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and 
			the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to 
			correct that information.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><br>
			<p class="style3">
			<strong>What Information We Collect and How We Use It <br></strong>
			Any information we collect on our Site generally falls into the 
			following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and 
			Aggregate Information.&nbsp; Personally Identifiable Information: This 
			refers to information that lets us know specifically who you are. In 
			general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or 
			revealing any Personally Identifiable Information. You may however, 
			voluntarily provide the following Personally Identifiable 
			Information:&nbsp;&nbsp; contact information, such as email address, physical 
			address, shipping address and billing address; financial information 
			including credit card, debit card, bank account numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp; In such 
			event, we might maintain a record of your contact, including such 
			Personally Identifiable Information, in a file specific to you. We 
			use this information to provide better service in the event you 
			contact us again. We additionally share, trade, rent, license, 
			and/or sell this information to third parties that we believe offer 
			products, services, and/or opportunities that are consistent with 
			your desire to be financially secure and/or independent.&nbsp; Note that 
			if you voluntarily provide us with Personally Identifiable 
			Information, you consent to our sales, trade, rent, license, use, 
			and storage of the information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, we may obtain 
			supplemental Personally Identifiable Information from third parties, 
			such as your driver license, credit card statement, and utility 
			bills to verify your Personally Identifiable Information. You 
			likewise consent to these practices.&nbsp; This supplemental Personally 
			Identifiable Information will be stored in our files and may be 
			shared and/or traded with and/or rented, licensed, and/or sold to 
			third parties.&nbsp; Aggregate Information: This refers to information 
			that does not by itself identify you as a specific individual. Such 
			information would include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") or 
			the Web site that referred you to our Site, your Internet Protocol 
			("IP") address (a number automatically assigned to your computer 
			whenever you surf the Web), your operating system and browser type, 
			and any search terms that you enter on our Site. Our Web server 
			aggregates this information in order to monitor the level of 
			activity on our Site, evaluate its effectiveness, and improve the 
			content of our Site in order to make your visit an easy and 
			enjoyable experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may collect, compile, store, publish, 
			promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use any Aggregate 
			Information, provided that, such information does not personally 
			identify you. We do not correlate any Personally Identifiable 
			Information with the Aggregate Information that we collect on our 
			Site. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, it will 
			be protected like any other Personally Identifiable Information 
			under this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><br>
			<p class="style3">
			<strong>Marketing</strong> <br>We may combine your information with 
			information we collect from other companies to improve our services 
			and to better serve your personalized needs. If you do not wish to 
			receive marketing communications from us, simply indicate your 
			preference once you sign in on the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><br>
			<p class="style3">
			<strong>Sharing Your Information<br></strong>We may 
			share Personally Identifiable Information you provide online 
			with other Pyxism-related entities and/or business partners that 
			provide services to Pyxism. Where we engage third-party agents or 
			contractors to perform services on our Site, we will require them to 
			observe the intent of this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, 
			we may release or share with our corporate family Personally 
			Identifiable Information when we believe that such is reasonably 
			necessary to investigate unlawful activities, or to protect the 
			rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves. We may be 
			required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in response 
			to court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also 
			reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any 
			activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyxism or 
			its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another 
			business entity, or their respective assets could be acquired. 
			Should such a merger or acquisition occur, you should expect that we 
			would share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information 
			to companies serving you and other users of our Site.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><br>
			<p class="style3">
			<strong>Security</strong> <br>Your Personally Identifiable 
			Information is stored on our servers in the United States. We treat 
			your Personally Identifiable Information very carefully and use our 
			best efforts to protect your Personally Identifiable Information 
			against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties 
			may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private 
			communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your Personally 
			Identifiable Information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, 
			we cannot promise, and you should not expect that your Personally 
			Identifiable Information or private communications will always 
			remain private. Moreover, this Privacy Policy only addresses the 
			information that we collect from you. This Private Policy does not 
			apply to the Personally Identifiable Information that you disclose 
			to others, such as bidders, buyers, or sellers on the Site or any 
			other sites throughout the Internet. Since we are unable to control 
			the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the 
			privacy policies of those third parties to whom you elect to 
			disclose the information.&nbsp; </p><br>
			<p class="style3">
			<strong>Your Choices</strong> <br>Your permission is always secured 
			first. We will not use or share the Personally Identifiable 
			Information collected on our Site in ways unrelated to the purpose 
			for which you provided the information, including those described 
			above, without providing you a choice whether to permit any such 
			unrelated uses.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><br>
			<p class="style3">
			<strong>Accessing and Correcting Your Information <br></strong>We 
			take reasonable measures to ensure that any Personally Identifiable 
			Information we collect on our Site is accurate, current, complete, 
			and reliable for its intended use.&nbsp; </p><br>
			<p class="style3">
			<strong>Protecting Your Information <br></strong>We acknowledge your 
			trust and are committed to take reasonable steps to protect 
			Personally Identifiable Information you provide online from loss, 
			misuse, and unauthorized access. We employ physical, electronic, and 
			managerial processes to safeguard and secure your information.&nbsp; </p><br>
			<p class="style3">
			<strong>Use 
			of Information Obtained from Pyxism</strong><br>We cannot guarantee the privacy 
			or security of your Personally Identifiable Information once we 
			share, trade, rent, license, and/or sell your Personally 
			Identifiable Information to third parties. We strongly encourage you 
			to evaluate the privacy and security policies of all these third 
			parties to determine how they may use your Personally Identifiable 
			Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of Cookies On This Site A "cookie" is a small 
			data file transferred to your computer's hard drive that allows a 
			Web site to respond to you as an individual, gathering and 
			remembering information about your preferences in order to tailor 
			its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes. Overall, cookies 
			are safe, as they only identify your computer to customize your Web 
			experience. Accepting a cookie does not provide access to your 
			computer or any Personally Identifiable Information about you, other 
			than the information you choose to share. Other servers cannot read 
			them, nor can they be used to deliver a virus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most browsers 
			automatically accept cookies, but you can usually adjust yours 
			(Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of 
			cookie placement requests, refuse certain cookies, or deny cookies 
			completely.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Site may send cookies to your computer's hard 
			drive to enhance your experience when visiting our Site.&nbsp; We do not 
			use "surveillance" cookies that track your web activity outside of 
			our Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Links To Other Web Sites Links to third-party Web sites 
			may be provided solely for your information and convenience. If you 
			use these links, you will leave our Site. This Privacy Statement 
			does not cover the information practices of those Web sites linked 
			to our Site, nor do we control their content or privacy policies. We 
			suggest that you carefully review the privacy policies of each site 
			you visit.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><br>
			<p class="style3">
			<strong>Children's Privacy Protection</strong> <br>We take special 
			care to protect the privacy needs of children under the age of 13 
			and encourage parents to be an active participant in their child's 
			online activities. We abide by the requirements of the Children's 
			Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other relevant laws. Our 
			Site does not target and is not intended for children under the age 
			of 13, and we will not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable 
			Information from them. If we discover personal data from a child 
			through an adult-oriented site, we will eliminate that data.&nbsp; </p><br>
			<p class="style3">
			<strong>Changes To This Statement <br></strong>Any updates or 
			changes to the terms of this Privacy Statement will be posted here 
			on our Site and the date of the newest version posted below. Please 
			check back frequently, especially before you submit any Personally 
			Identifiable Information at our Site, to see if this Privacy 
			Statement has changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Use of Your Information We cannot 
			ensure that all of your private communications and other Personally 
			Identifiable Information will never be disclosed in ways not 
			otherwise described in this Privacy Statement. For example, we may 
			be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties 
			under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully 
			intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can 
			(and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law 
			enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole 
			discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an 
			investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or 
			other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
