I, how­ever, never link to spe­cific prod­ucts just in or­der to ad­ver­tize them. I link only to the prod­ucts that I gen­uinely find help­ful and the web­pages link­ing to such prod­ucts ex­press my hon­est opin­ion on the prod­ucts. In other words, I never rec­om­mend a prod­uct just in or­der to per­suade you to buy it; I rec­om­mend it be­cause I my­self find it use­ful.</p>
