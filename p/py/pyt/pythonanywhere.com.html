<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


<p>
We take the privacy of our customers very seriously at PythonAnywhere.  Most 
importantly, we do not and never will sell anyone's information to a third 
party.

</p><p>
This Privacy Policy gives a few more details about how we collect, 
use, maintain and disclose information collected from you when you use our 
site.

</p><h2>Personal identification information</h2>

<p>
We may collect personal identification information from you in a variety of
ways, including, but not limited to, when you visit our site, register on the
site, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services,
features or resources we make available on our site. Free users are asked for
their email address when they sign up.  If you sign up for a paid plan, the
payment processor will provide us with a physical billing (postal) address.  We
will keep these details private.

</p><p>
We will collect personal identification information from you only if you
voluntarily submit such information to us by signing up or subscribing for a 
paid account. You can always refuse to supply the information, except that it
may prevent you from engaging in certain activities on our site.

</p><h2>Non-personal identification information</h2>

<p>
We may collect non-personal identification information about you whenever you 
interact with our site. Non-personal identification information may include the 
browser name, the type of computer and technical information about your means of 
connection to our site, such as the operating system and the Internet service 
providers utilized and other similar information.  For the technically inclined 
— by this, we mean just the normal stuff that goes into our web server 
logs.  These logs are deleted at least every 30 days, and frequently faster.


</p><h2>Web browser cookies</h2>

<p>
Our site uses cookies to enhance your experience.  Your web browser places 
cookies on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track 
information about you. You may choose to tell your web browser to refuse 
cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. 
However, if you do so, note that some parts of the site may not function 
properly.  In particular, our login system uses cookies — so if you don't accept 
them, you won't be able to log in.

</p><h2>How we use collected information</h2>

<p>
We may collect and use your personal information for the following purposes:

</p><dl>
    <dt>To improve customer service
    </dt><dd>Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service 
    requests and support needs more efficiently.
    </dd><dt>To discover how people find and use our site
    </dt><dd>We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our users as 
    a group use the services and resources provided on our site.  In particular, 
    we use Google Analytics (which uses cookies) to find out where people found
    us (referring websites) and how much they use our site.
    </dd><dt>To improve our site
    </dt><dd>We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services.  
    There wouldn't be much point in asking for it otherwise :-)
    </dd><dt>To process payments
    </dt><dd>We use the information you provide about yourself (either directly or
    via our payment provider) when you sign up for a paid account solely to
    manage that paid account. We do not share this information with outside
    parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service or to comply
    with legal requirements (for example, if you used our site to hack into
    another site and the police turned up on our doorstep demanding to know who
    you were, we would hand over the details we have).
    </dd><dt>To send periodic emails
    </dt><dd>We may use the email address to send you information and updates 
    about the site. It may also be used to respond to your inquiries, questions, 
    and/or other requests. Unless you decide to unsubscribe from our mailing 
    list, you'll will receive (very occasional!) emails that may include 
    product news, and updates.  To be completely
    clear about this — you'll only get these from us, we'll never pass
    them on to "partners" or anything like that.  If at any time you would like 
    to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can do so by following
    the instructions in the email.
</dd></dl>

<h2>How we protect your information</h2>

<p>
We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and 
security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure 
or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction 
information and data stored on our site.

</p><p>
All communication between the site and you happens over an
SSL secured channel and is encrypted and protected with digital 
signatures.


</p><h2>Sharing your personal information</h2>

<p>
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to 
others.  We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to 
any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with 
our business partners, and trusted affiliates for the purposes 
outlined above.  For example, if a partner wants to know how many of our
users are in the US versus the number in the EU, we'll tell them.  We won't tell
them who you are.


</p><h2>Third party websites</h2>

<p>
Any other sites that we link to will have their own privacy policies, which
might differ from ours.


</p><h2>Changes to this privacy policy</h2>

<p>
We have the right to update this privacy policy at any time. If we do, we will 
revise the updated date at the bottom of this page and email those users who
are subscribed to our mailing list.  If you unsubscribe from the list but
want to know if this policy changes, you should check this page regularly.

</p><h2>Your acceptance of these terms</h2>

<p>
By using this site, you signify your acceptance of this policy and the 
<a href="/terms/">terms of service</a>. If you do not agree to this 
policy, please do not use our site. Your continued use of the site following the 
posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those 
changes.

or your dealings with this site, please contact us at
