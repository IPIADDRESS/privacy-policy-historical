            Your privacy is important to us. So we've developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, and store your personal information. Please take a moment to read through this policy and let us know if you have any questions.
            <br><br>
            By visiting pynk.io, any subdomains of pynk.io or any PYNK apps you are accepting this policy.
            <br><br>
            CrowdSense Limited ("CrowdSense", "Pynk", "Pynk.io", "we", "us" or "our") is a Data Controller for the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation. If you have any questions regarding how we manage your data, please contact us at compliance@pynk.io.
            <br><br>

            <b>What data we collect and why</b><br>
            Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
            <br><br>
            Pynk collects your personal data directly from you and from third parties. In all cases Pynk must have a valid basis to process your personal information.
            <br><br>
            There are 6 ‘lawful bases’ under the data protection laws, of which 4 are relevant for your personal data and Pynk. These are:
            <br><br>
            Consent – you agree to allow us to control or use this data
            Contract – processing is necessary for the contract between you and Pynk
            Legal obligation – processing is necessary to comply with the law
            Legitimate Interest - when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information.
            But even then, it must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you. If we rely on our legitimate interest, we will tell you what that is
            <br><br>
            Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending direct marketing communications to you via electronic means such as email or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to processing at any time by contacting us. You can also alter your communication preferences in your account profile under preferences.
            <br><br>

            <b>Information you give us</b><br>
            You may give us personal information about you by filling in forms on our website pynk.io  (our "Site") or by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail, post or instant chat. You may also provide personal information when you register to use our Site; subscribe to our services; enter a competition promotion or survey; and when you report a problem with our Site.
            <br><br>
            The information you give us may include your name, address, e-mail address and phone number, financial information, personal description, photograph, and other information which may be considered personal in that it may be used to identify you.
            <br><br>
            By completing any of our forms on our Site you are signifying your explicit consent to Pynk collecting such information.
            <br><br>
            It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.
            <br><br>
            Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you. In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
            <br><br>

            <b>Information we collect about you</b><br>

            <b>Information we receive from other sources</b><br>

            <b>Privacy Policy &amp; Terms</b><br>
            Sometimes we may collect and use particularly sensitive personal information which requires higher levels of protection such as information on political affiliations and/or criminal convictions. This is known as "special category data". We need to be able to collect, store and use this type of personal information for the services we provide.
            <br><br>
            We can only collect and use sensitive personal information in limited circumstances, where we’ve obtained your explicit consent, where we need this information to deliver our products and services to you or where we have another legal basis for doing so as explained in this privacy policy.
            <br><br>
            We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data).

            <b>Automated Decision Making</b><br>
            Pynk use systems to make automated decisions about you when signing up to Pynk. This is to ensure we are operating in line with relevant regulations and laws on how we conduct our business. We use automated decision making in assessing your suitability to invest with Pynk, and when completing background checks before accepting you as a customer.
            <br><br>

            <b>How long we keep your personal data</b>
            We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.  By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes, and we may also use such data to enable us to respond to any future complaints, or to share information with the Financial Conduct Authority who regulate us.
            <br><br>

            <b>Your rights</b><br>
            <b>Right of access</b><br>
            Commonly known as a "data subject access request" – this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. Please send any requests to <a href="mailto:compliance@pynk.io">compliance@pynk.io</a>.
            <br><br>

            <b>Right to rectification</b><br>
            You have the right to question any information we have about you that you think is wrong or incomplete. Please contact us if you want to do this.
            <br><br>
            If you do, we will take reasonable steps to check its accuracy and correct it. You can contact us about this at compliance@pynk.io
            <br><br>

            <b>Right to be forgotten</b><br>
            You have the right to request deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. There may be legal or other official reasons why we need to keep or use your data and we will notify you if any of these reasons are applicable in response to your request. But please tell us if you think that we should not be using it.
            <br><br>

            <b>Right to portability</b><br>
            You have the right to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. This allows you to move, copy, or transfer personal data in a safe and secure way from one IT environment to another.
            <br><br>

            <b>Right to object</b><br>
            The right to object exists where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
            <br><br>

            <b>Right to restrict processing</b><br>
            This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
            <br><br>

            <b>Right to withdraw consent:</b><br>
            This right exists where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. Please be aware that if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. If this is the case, we will tell you.
            <br><br>
            You are also able to change or remove your  preferences via your online dashboard within the profile section under ‘preferences’. Alternatively, you can contact our customer service team via online chat, secure messaging, email or telephone.
