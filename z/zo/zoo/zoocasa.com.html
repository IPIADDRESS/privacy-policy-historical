<li>You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal, contractual and other restrictions, provided that you give reasonable notice of withdrawal of consent to Zoocasa. On receipt of notice of withdrawal of consent, Zoocasa will inform you of the likely consequences of the withdrawal of consent, which may include the inability of Zoocasa to provide certain services for which that information is necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limits on Collection of Personal Information</h2>

<p>Zoocasa will not collect information indiscriminately and will limit collection of information to that which is reasonable and necessary to provide services and which is reasonable and necessary for the purposes consented to by you.

<li>Zoocasa will keep personal information used to make a decision affecting you for at least one year after using it to make the decision.</li>

<li>Zoocasa will take due care when destroying personal information so as to prevent unauthorized access to the information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accuracy</h2>

<ul>
<li>Zoocasa will make a reasonable effort to ensure that personal information it is using or disclosing is accurate and complete.</li>

<li><p>Zoocasa will take reasonable steps, through contractual or other reasonable means, to ensure that a comparable level of personal information protection is implemented by the suppliers and agents who assist in providing services.</p></li>

<li>physical measures such as locked filing cabinets;</li>
<li>organizational measures such as restricting employee access to files and databases as appropriate;</li>
<li>electronic measures such as passwords and firewalls; and</li>
<li>investigative measures where Zoocasa has reasonable grounds to believe that personal information is being inappropriately collected, used or disclosed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In order to ensure the safety and privacy of your information, Zoocasa maintains internal Privacy Policy Guidelines and employees are regularly trained on these guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that confidentiality and security are not assured when information is transmitted through e-mail or other wireless communication.</p></li>

Nevertheless, it is possible for children to publicly post or distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent within chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups. No communication, however, will be sent to anyone or information collected from anyone who indicates that they are younger than 16 years old without their parents' permission.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Providing Access</h2>

<ul>
<li>You have a right to access your personal information held by Zoocasa.</li>

Zoocasa may charge a reasonable fee for doing so.</li>
<li>Zoocasa will make the information available within 30 days or provide written notice where additional time is required to fulfil the request.</li>
<li>In some situations, Zoocasa may not be able to provide access to certain personal information (e.g., if disclosure would reveal personal information about another individual, the personal information is protected by solicitor/client privilege, the information was collected for the purposes of an investigation or where disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial information that could harm the competitive position of Zoocasa). Zoocasa may also be prevented by law from providing access to certain personal information.</li>
<li>Where an access request is refused, Zoocasa will notify you in writing, document the reasons for refusal and outline further steps which are available to you.</li>
</ul>
