<li>Zoocasa will obtain your consent to collect, use or disclose personal information except where Zoocasa is authorized or required by law to do so without consent.  For example, Zoocasa may collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent where: the information is publicly available, as defined by statute or regulation; Zoocasa is obtaining legal advice; or, Zoocasa reasonably expects that obtaining consent would compromise an investigation or proceeding. Other exceptions may apply.</li>
<li>Your consent can be express, implied or given through an authorized representative such as a lawyer, agent, broker or other 3rd party. Consent may be provided orally, in writing, electronically, through inaction (such as when you fail to notify Zoocasa that you do not wish your personal information collected/used/disclosed for various purposes after you have received notice of those purposes) or otherwise.</li>
<li>You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal, contractual and other restrictions, provided that you give reasonable notice of withdrawal of consent to Zoocasa. On receipt of notice of withdrawal of consent, Zoocasa will inform you of the likely consequences of the withdrawal of consent, which may include the inability of Zoocasa to provide certain services for which that information is necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limits on Collection of Personal Information</h2>

<p>Zoocasa will not collect information indiscriminately and will limit collection of information to that which is reasonable and necessary to provide services and which is reasonable and necessary for the purposes consented to by you. Zoocasa will also collect information as authorized or required by law.</p>

<li>Your personal information will only be used or disclosed for the purposes set out above or authorized by you, and as authorized or required by law.</li>
<li>Zoocasa will keep personal information used to make a decision affecting you for at least one year after using it to make the decision.</li>
<li>Zoocasa will destroy, erase or make anonymous documents or other records containing personal information as soon as it is reasonable to assume that the original purpose is no longer being served by retention of the information and retention is no longer necessary for legal, regulatory, compliance, or business purposes.</li>
<li>Zoocasa will take due care when destroying personal information so as to prevent unauthorized access to the information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accuracy</h2>

<ul>
<li>Zoocasa will make a reasonable effort to ensure that personal information it is using or disclosing is accurate and complete.</li>
<li>If you demonstrate the inaccuracy or incompleteness of personal information, Zoocasa will amend the information as required. If appropriate, Zoocasa will send the amended information to third parties to whom the information has been disclosed.</li>
<li>When a challenge regarding the accuracy of personal information is not resolved to your satisfaction, Zoocasa will annotate the personal information under its control with a note that the correction was requested but not made.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safeguarding Personal Information</h2>

<ul>
<li>Zoocasa protects the personal information in its custody or control by making reasonable security arrangements based on the sensitivity and format of the information to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal, loss, theft, or similar risks.</li>
<li><p>Zoocasa will take reasonable steps, through contractual or other reasonable means, to ensure that a comparable level of personal information protection is implemented by the suppliers and agents who assist in providing services.</p></li>
<li><p>Some specific safeguards include:</p>

<ul>
<li>physical measures such as locked filing cabinets;</li>
<li>organizational measures such as restricting employee access to files and databases as appropriate;</li>
<li>electronic measures such as passwords and firewalls; and</li>
<li>investigative measures where Zoocasa has reasonable grounds to believe that personal information is being inappropriately collected, used or disclosed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In order to ensure the safety and privacy of your information, Zoocasa maintains internal Privacy Policy Guidelines and employees are regularly trained on these guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that confidentiality and security are not assured when information is transmitted through e-mail or other wireless communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Zoocasa.com is not marketed to or directed towards children. Nevertheless, it is possible for children to publicly post or distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent within chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups. No communication, however, will be sent to anyone or information collected from anyone who indicates that they are younger than 16 years old without their parents' permission.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Providing Access</h2>

<ul>
<li>You have a right to access your personal information held by Zoocasa.</li>
<li>Upon written request and authentication of your identity, Zoocasa will provide you with your personal information under its control, information about the ways in which your information is being used and a description of the individuals and organizations to whom that information has been disclosed. Zoocasa may charge a reasonable fee for doing so.</li>
<li>Zoocasa will make the information available within 30 days or provide written notice where additional time is required to fulfil the request.</li>
<li>In some situations, Zoocasa may not be able to provide access to certain personal information (e.g., if disclosure would reveal personal information about another individual, the personal information is protected by solicitor/client privilege, the information was collected for the purposes of an investigation or where disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial information that could harm the competitive position of Zoocasa). Zoocasa may also be prevented by law from providing access to certain personal information.</li>
<li>Where an access request is refused, Zoocasa will notify you in writing, document the reasons for refusal and outline further steps which are available to you.</li>
</ul>
