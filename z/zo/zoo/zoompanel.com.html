			<h1>ZoomPanel Privacy Policy</h1>
			<h2>Privacy Policy Revised: August 2006</h2>

			<p><a href="https://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.zoompanel.com" target="_blank"><img src="/images/clickseal.gif" width="91" height="73" border="0" align="right"></a>The ZoomPanel is operated by MarketTools, Inc. MarketTools is a professional online marketing research company, which adheres to all CASRO (Council of American Survey Research Organizations) guidelines to protect all respondent confidentiality.

			<h2 id="infoCollection">INFORMATION COLLECTION</h2>

			<p>When you fill out the ZoomPanel registration questionnaire, we gather your contact and demographic information such as email address, age, gender, postal address and zip code. We track this information so that we can send you surveys that are appropriate for or relevant to you. We try to ask your opinions about products and services with which you are familiar and that are readily available where you live.</p>

			<p>We also need to know about you so that we can ensure that a broad group of people is given the opportunity to respond to each survey. Often, the survey group must represent the diverse population comprised of specific geographic regions or age groups.</p>

			<h3>LOG FILES</h3>

			<p>When you visit the ZoomPanel website (the "Site"), or participate in a survey, we gather certain information about your computer automatically and store it in log files. This information includes, but is not limited to, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring and exiting pages, operating system, screen resolution, color capabilities, date and time stamp, click stream data, and information regarding which JavaScript version your computer has and whether your computer is enabled for Flash<sup>®</sup> and ActiveX. We tie personal information to logged information to (1) prevent abuse of our system, (b) track clicks and (c) ensure completion of the registration process.</p>

			<h3>COOKIES</h3>

			<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer that is used for authenticating, tracking, and maintaining specific information about you, such as your site preferences. We use cookies on the ZoomPanel website.</p>

			<p>We may use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. Session ID cookies make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your internet browser's "Help" file.</p>

			<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, however your ability to participate in surveys may be limited.</p>

			<p class="sectionNav"><a href="#rowOne">^ back to top</a></p>

			<h2 id="howWeUse">INFORMATION THAT WE USE AND SHARE</h2>

			<p>The personally identifiable information you provide us is used when we need to communicate with you. The communications that you will receive from the ZoomPanel will involve:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Invitations to participate in our surveys</li>
			<li>Communications about sweepstakes or other rewards for your participation</li>
			<li>Offers from MarketTools, Inc. or Zoomerang, a service of MarketTools, Inc.</li>

Data supplementation involves appending any publicly available information about you to your personal profile.</p>

			<p>On occasion, ZoomPanel may send the information we gather about you to other trusted third-party data processors to organize, process and/or analyze the data on our behalf. For instance, we use such services to ensure that your opt-out requests are honored and we use other such services to send surveys to those of you participating in our mobile panel.</p>

			<p>All such third-party data processors are (a) prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to ZoomPanel and (b) contractually bound to observe this ZoomPanel privacy policy to ensure that the confidentiality of your personal information will be maintained.</p>

For example, we may let a client know that female survey respondents aged 25-34 preferred product A over product B. We do not disclose your first name, last name, postal address, email address or any other personally identifiable information to these third parties unless you provide us with your express consent.</p>

We use this information to help our clients qualify and notify contest winners and award prizes. We will not share such personally identifiable information with any third party unless we give you prior notice and the opportunity to opt out (though failure to provide certain contact information may impact our clients' ability to award prizes).</p>

			<p>We may use a third-party service provide to conduct these contests and sweepstakes.
