Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your requests, or we may ask you to provide us with additional information in connection with your request, which may be Personal Data, for example, if we need to verify your identity or the nature of your request.

                <p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
                <p>Zoom and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and gather information about our user base, such as location information based on IP addresses. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. For more information regarding cookies or similar technologies, please review our&nbsp;<a href="https://zoom.us/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
                <a name="about-ads"></a>
                <p>Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Products do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Products and after you leave our properties.</p>
                <p><strong>Interest-Based Advertisements</strong></p>
                <p>We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Some of our third-party partners use technologies such as cookies and other technologies to gather information about your activities on this website, our affiliates’ websites, and unaffiliated websites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. With respect to our interest-based ads, we adhere to self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising issued by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”) (collectively, the “OBA Principles”). More information about the OBA Principles can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/principles">https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/principles</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.edaa.eu/european-principles/">https://www.edaa.eu/european-principles/</a>. If you wish to not have information about your online activities over time and across different websites used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you can opt-out by clicking&nbsp;<a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/">here</a>&nbsp;and here (or if located in the EU&nbsp;<a href="https://youronlinechoices.eu/">click here</a>). Please note that (1) this does not opt you out of being served ads, and even if you opt out of interest-based ads, you will continue to receive generic ads and (2) we store your opt-out preference for interest-based ads in a cookie on your device, and therefore you may have to opt out again if you delete your cookies.</p>
                <p><strong>Geolocation</strong></p>
                <p>We collect information about where you are located when you are using our Products. We use this information for purposes such as optimizing your connection to our data center, supporting compliance, and suggesting customizations to your experience with our Products (e.g. your language preference).</p>
                <p><strong>Sharing your Personal Data</strong></p>
                <p>We do not sell or rent your Personal Data to third parties for any purposes, including marketing.</p>
                <p>We share Personal Data within Zoom and its affiliated companies, and with third party service providers for purposes of data processing or storage.</p>
                <p>We also share Personal Data with business partners, service vendors and/or authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide requested Products or transactions, including processing orders, processing credit card transactions, hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration and providing customer support. We provide these third parties with Personal to complete/utilize the requested Product or transaction.</p>
                <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this policy. As required by law, we may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or similar legal process by disclosing your Personal Data and other related information, if necessary. We also may use Personal Data and other related information to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
                <p>We collect and possibly share Personal Data and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Zoom's terms of service, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
                <p>While navigating Zoom's website or Products, you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third-party. When information is collected on behalf of Zoom exclusively, Zoom's Privacy Policy will be referenced and will govern how your information is used. For other, non-Zoom sites or services, the site/service owner's privacy policy will be referenced. You should review such third party’s privacy and security policies prior to use.</p>
                <p><strong>Security of your Personal Data</strong></p>
                <p>Zoom is committed to protecting the Personal Data you share with us. We utilize a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When we transfer credit card information over the Internet, we protect it using Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology.</p>
                <p>We recommend you take every precaution in protecting your Personal Data when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser. If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Data, you can contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@zoom.us">privacy@zoom.us</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Linked websites and third-party services</strong></p>
                <p>Our websites and services may provide links to other third-party websites and services which are outside our control and not covered by this policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) sites you visit or services you use.</p>
                <p><strong>Newsgroups/forums</strong></p>
                <p>If you participate in a Zoom discussion forum or chat room, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside Zoom, who have access to that discussion forum or chat room. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant's opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Zoom.</p>
                <p><strong>Meeting Recordings</strong></p>
                <p>If you use a feature of the Products that allows for Recordings (defined below), we collect information from you that you provide in connection with such use and through such Recordings, to the extent you provide it to us. This information may include Personal Data, if you provide us with Personal Data.</p>
                <p><strong><em>For hosts</em></strong>&nbsp;-- By installing or using Zoom Rooms software or any other Zoom software, tool or feature that allows for meeting or Webinar recording (each, a “Recording”), you acknowledge and agree that you and your company are responsible for (i) clearly notifying all individuals (whether or not they are Zoom users) who are present in a meeting or Webinar (whether in-person or remotely) (each, an “Attendee”) for which you make a Recording that such meeting or Webinar might be recorded, and (ii) obtaining any consent necessary for such a recording as required by applicable laws, rules and regulations, including without limitation data privacy laws. By making a Recording of any meeting or Webinar using any Zoom Products, you and your company represent and warrant that (a) you have received legally sufficient consent from all Attendees for such recording&nbsp;<strong><em>prior</em></strong>&nbsp;to starting a Recording, (b) you will only make, use, store and otherwise process such Recording in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including data protection laws and (c) you will store and otherwise restrict access to such Recordings using appropriate technical and organizational safeguards.&nbsp;<strong>Any person and/or entity who makes a Recording of a meeting or webinar shall be the data controller of that Recording, and Zoom will be the data processor with respect to the Recording</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong><em>For attendees</em></strong>&nbsp;– Please be advised that for any meetings or Webinars you attend, Recordings can be enabled by a meeting or webinar host. By signing up for Zoom’s services or otherwise using them in any way, including without limitation by attending any Zoom meeting or webinar, you expressly acknowledge that Zoom may, if instructed by a meeting host, make and store Recordings for Zoom meetings or webinars, and may make such recordings available to hosts and other Attendees at the direction of the host. A visual notification will be sent to Attendees who connect to a meeting or webinar via the Zoom web-based platform, and an audio notification will be sent to Attendees who dial-in by telephone only. A host may also send an audio notification to Attendees who are logged into the web platform, provided that you may not receive such notifications if you disable them in your account settings, so please check before each meeting or webinar if you want to receive the notifications. If you do not want to be recorded, you can choose to leave the meeting or webinar.</p>
                <p><strong>Transfer and Storage of Personal Data</strong></p>
                <p>Our Products are hosted and operated in the United States (“U.S.”) through Zoom and its service providers. We may transfer your Personal Data to the U.S., to any Zoom affiliate worldwide, or to third parties acting on our behalf for the purposes of processing or storage. By using any of our Products or providing any Personal Data for any of the purposes stated above, you consent to the transfer and storage of your Personal Data, whether provided by you or obtained through a third party, to the U.S. as set forth herein, including the hosting of such Personal Data on U.S. servers.</p>
                <p><u>EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield</u><br> Zoom participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. Zoom is committed to subjecting all Personal Data received from EU member countries and Switzerland, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Frameworks, to the Framework's applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's&nbsp;Privacy Shield List, https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.</p>
                <p>Zoom is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Zoom complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>
                <p>With respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Zoom is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Zoom may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
                <p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at&nbsp;<a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.</p>
                <p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the&nbsp;Privacy Shield website https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you can invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>
