          <li>perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>With whom we share your information</strong></p>
        <p><u>Personal Information.</u>&nbsp;We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with:</p>
        <ul>

These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, member screenings, supporting the Website functionality, and other features offered through the Website.

          <li>Social Networking Sites. We may share the information in your account (including your personal information) with the SNSs that you have linked to your account.

          <li>Other Situations.&nbsp;We also may disclose your information, including personal information:
            <ul>

In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</li>
              <li>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce the Website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</li>
              <li>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>Aggregated And Non-Personal Information.</u>&nbsp;We may share non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on the Website and on websites of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated, non-personal information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Third-party websites</strong></p>
        <p>There may be places on the Website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on a third party link on the Website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>How you can access your information</strong></p>
        <p>If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account&nbsp;and clicking on your account settings. More information about how to contact us is provided below. If you have an online account with us, you also may close your account at any time by contacting us at the contact information provided below. After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to the Website or access any of your personal information. If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of the Website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Your choices about collection and use of your information</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of the Website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on the Website.</li>
          <li>If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to have your SNS account (e.g., Facebook) linked to your account, then you may de-link the SNS account in the “preferences” section in your account settings.</li>
          <li>You may manage your marketing preferences by contacting us at the address provided below. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>How we protect your personal information</strong></p>
        <p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Information you provide about yourself while using our service</strong></p>
        <p>We provide areas on the Website where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our&nbsp;Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Children's privacy</strong></p>
        <p>We do not solicit children to purchase our services. We restrict the use of our service to individuals age 14 and above. The Website is not designed to attract children under the age of 13 and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Visiting the Website from outside the United States</strong></p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on the Website from residents of the United States. If you are visiting the Website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>No Rights of Third Parties</strong></p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
        <p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check the Website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.</p>
