Using Zoo to search the web gets you results from Google, Yahoo!, and Wikipedia. When you search using the news tab, you see the latest from ABC, Fox and Yahoo! News. InfoSpace, Inc. owns and operates Zoo. We urge kids to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know. Zoo is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Protection Act of 1998. <br><br> Please note that this policy only applies to our data collection and use practices for this website (www.zoo.com) (the "Site") and the services we provide through the Site (collectively, the "Services"), and does not apply to the data collection and use practices of other companies or organizations whose products, services or Web sites you may use or gain access through the Site and Services.

Generally, we limit our collection of information from Zoo to what is known as non-personally identifiable information. When a user visits Zoo we collect anonymous (i.e. non-personally identifying) information that the user's browser makes available, such as the originating Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and operating system, the date and time of the visit, the duration and activity of the visit and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the referring and exiting Web sites. We generally use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information. We use this information for a variety of purposes, including the administration and operation of our Web sites and other properties, designing and developing new products and services and generally improving the overall quality of the user's experience. We do not require users to share personally-identifiable information, such as name or email address, in order to use the search services of Zoo. <br><br> From time to time, however, we may request or users may otherwise voluntarily provide us information that may personally identify the user (e.g. email address and/or email address of parent or third party), as explained below, in order to allow the user to share information and interests with others and offer and conduct other online activities (e.g. tell-a-friend service). We do not condition a user's participation in any of the online activities on Zoo on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. When we request personal information from you, we will inform you of the type of information we need and the purpose of our use. We only use personal information we receive for the purpose it was collected.</font><br><br><h1><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="1" color="#CC3333"><b>Tell-A-Friend and Email Messages</b></font></h1><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="1" color="#000000">Zoo allows users to send information about services and products available on the Site to others that may be interested, and from time to time will send, on behalf of users who request it, email messages to family and/or friends to let family and/or friends share their interests. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about Zoo, we ask for the user's first name and friend's email address and automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit Zoo. We do not require users to submit personally identifiable information about themselves in order to send an electronic postcard or for Zoo to send email messages to family or friends, and we do not store the information related to the friends and the one-time email sent pursuant to the user's input will be our only contact with that person for such input. <br><br> Zoo may also provide the opportunity to feedback to us. In doing so, we do not request personally identifiable information. <br><br> All information collected for electronic postcards and email messages is used only to send the requested electronic postcard or email message and is deleted from our system once the electronic postcard, email message or email response is sent.</font><br><br><h1><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="1" color="#CC3333"><b>Cookies</b></font></h1><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="1" color="#000000">When you visit Zoo one or more cookies, web beacons or action tags may be sent to your computer or otherwise used in connection with your visit or use by InfoSpace and its third party service providers.

For a session cookie, once you close your browser the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie stays stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can change the settings on your browser to refuse or notify you prior to accepting cookies and to remove them from your computer. However, some features, products and services may not function properly without cookies. <br><br> We do not store any personal information into cookies nor do we link or combine information collected through cookies to any personal information that users submit online to us through Zoo.

For example, we use third party advertising companies that collect anonymous information about your visits to and interaction with our site as part of their service serving advertisements to our site. In the event we share any of your personal information with any such third party service provider, the third party will be obligated to only use such information for the limited purpose of providing us with their specific product or service and to maintain the privacy of any such personal information disclosed or shared.

As such, information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed and transferred as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide Infospace products and services, the sale or pledge of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets.</li><li><b>Protection of Infospace; Compliance with Law.</b> We will disclose personal information or remove, destroy or alter personal information in our possession or control when we believe it is necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, its employees, customers or the public.</li></ul></font><h1><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="1" color="#CC3333"><b>Third Party Information Collection and Use; Links</b></font></h1><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="1" color="#000000">Zoo uses and provides access to products, services and content of third parties (collectively, <b>"Third Party Properties"</b>), such as third party links and advertisements.
