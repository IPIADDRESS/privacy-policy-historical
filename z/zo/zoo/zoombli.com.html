		<p>Zoombli takes your privacy as seriously as you do. Respecting your privacy is our lifeblood because without customers like you we have no business.  This Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use personal information such as your name and email address. We hope that this will help you to make informed decisions when visiting our web sites, buying from us, or otherwise using our services.</p>
		
		<h5 class="privacy">What This Privacy Policy Covers and Applies To</h5>
    	<p>This Privacy Policy covers how Zoombli treats personal information that we collect and receive. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name or email address.  This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services, and websites offered by Zoombli. In this Privacy Policy, references to “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Zoombli while “you” and “your” refer to you, the customer or user. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Zoombli does not own or control or to people that Zoombli does not employ or manage.</p>
		
		<h5 class="privacy">Information We Collect</h5>
    	<p>We collect personal information when you subscribe to one of our newsletters, download a trial version of a product being promoted by us, or purchase a product or service from us. The type of information we collect may vary based upon the way we interact with you. For example, if you sign up for a newsletter we may only collect your name and email address.  However, if you make a purchase from us then we may also collect your credit card number and physical address in order to complete the purchase and deliver any physical products. We may combine information that we have about you with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.</p>
		<p>Zoombli automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Zoombli cookie information, and pages you request. This is done as part of regular internet communication between a browser and a web site.</p>
		
		<h5 class="privacy">How We Use Collected Information</h5>
    	<p>Zoombli uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.</p>

		<h5 class="privacy">Children</h5>
	    <p>This site is not aimed to attract children and its objective is not to collect personal information from children. Anyone under the age of 18 should not use this site unless supervised by an adult. Zoombli’s goal is to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to collection and use of information from children, including the Children’s On-line Privacy Protection Act of the United States.</p>

		<h5 class="privacy">Information Sharing and Disclosure</h5>
    	<p>Zoombli does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: </p>
			<ul class="privacy">
    			<li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Zoombli under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Zoombli communicate with you (for example, email service providers). These companies, however, do not have any independent right to use or share this information.</li>
			    <li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</li>
			    <li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Zoombli’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
			    <li>We transfer information about you if Zoombli is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Zoombli will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
			    <li>Zoombli may display targeted offers based on personal information. Advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted offers meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.</li>
			    <li>Zoombli does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or complete a targeted offer. By interacting with or viewing an offer, however, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.</li>
			</ul>
