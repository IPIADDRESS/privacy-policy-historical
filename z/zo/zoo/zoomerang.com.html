Your privacy is important to us. MarketTools, Inc., through our Zoomerang service, has created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit our www.zoomerang.com site, why we collect it and how it is used.</p>

				<p class="p-3">In Part II of this policy, the term "you"  refers to the User utilizing our www.zoomerang.com site; in Part I of this  policy, the term "you" refers to the person receiving or responding  to a User’s survey ("Survey Respondent"). "Users" are users  of the Zoomerang service who register to build and deploy surveys and who from  time to time might purchase other services offered by Zoomerang. The terms  "MarketTools," "Zoomerang," and "we" refer to  MarketTools, Inc. This Privacy Policy is governed by our <a href="http://info.zoomerang.com/terms.htm">Terms of Use</a>. By using this  web site, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.</p>
  <p class="p-3">"Personally Identifiable Information" means any  information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not  limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, email  address, phone number, or other contact information, whether at work or at  home. We ask for your personally identifiable information at several points on  our website. When purchasing a service through the website we also ask for your  financial information, such as your credit card number.</p>
 <p class="p-3">Please be aware that this Privacy Policy and the choices you make  on this web site will not necessarily apply to personal information you may  have provided to MarketTools in the context of other, separately operated,  MarketTools products or services, such as Zoompanel.com.</p>
 <p class="p-3"><a href="http://www.markettools.com">MarketTools, Inc.</a> is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build  user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair  information practices. This privacy statement covers the site <a href="http://www.zoomerang.com">www.zoomerang.com</a>. Because this Web site  wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose  its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for  compliance by TRUSTe.</p>

				  <h4>What is Zoomerang?</h4>
	<p class="p-3">Zoomerang is a survey clearinghouse that that enables our Users to  create surveys and questionnaires for distribution to Survey Respondents.  Zoomerang is committed to its policy of protecting the privacy and confidential  information of our Users, as described in Part II of this policy. We also  protect the privacy of Survey Respondents (other than <a href="../prodserv/sample/panelists.htm">ZoomPanelists</a>) as described in  Part I of this policy. Part II of our Privacy Policy applies only to our Users,  who are subscribers to our Zoomerang service. <a href="http://www.markettools.com">MarketTools’</a> privacy practices  related to <a href="http://www.zoompanel.com">ZoomPanel members</a> are  described in the <a href="http://www.zoompanel.com/privacy.asp">Zoompanel.com  privacy policy</a>, not in this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<h4>Part I. Survey Respondents</h4>
	<p class="p-3"><a href="http://www.markettools.com">MarketTools’</a> Zoomerang is a hosting service only. Our Users (as  that term is defined in the <a href="http://info.zoomerang.com/terms.htm">Terms  of Use</a>) use our service to send surveys to Survey Respondents or to post  survey links on a website. Survey Respondents may be clients, employees,  suppliers, etc. of our Users or they may be <a href="http://www.zoompanel.com">ZoomPanel  members</a>. [MarketTools’ Zoomerang service complies with the United  States/European Union Data Protection Safe Harbor Arrangement (the "Safe Harbor")  regarding the processing of data from the European Union. As described in the  Safe Harbor,] MarketTools acts as a "Data Processor" (a company  that processes Personally Identifiable Information on behalf of a Data  Controller) and each MarketTools User acts as a "Data Controller" (a  company that determines the purposes for which and the means by which the  Personally Identifiable Information is processed). To "process"  information means to carry out an operation or set of operations on the  information, such as collecting, recording, storing, disclosing, or organizing  it.</p>
			<p class="p-3">Information that Survey Respondents provide to Users passes  through our service and resides on our servers. That information may be stored  and processed in the United    States or any other country in which  MarketTools or its agents, acting on behalf of MarketTools, maintain  facilities.</p>
<p class="p-3">As a Data Processor, MarketTools will only process Personally  Identifiable Information of Survey Respondents pursuant to the instructions of  the applicable User. MarketTools may use the services of third-party Data  Processors to process Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with  purposes identified for such information by the applicable User. Third-party  service providers are prohibited from using Personally Identifiable Information  for any secondary reasons. Except as provided in Part I of this Privacy Policy,  MarketTools will not intentionally transfer or provide access to Personally  Identifiable Information of Survey Respondents to any person without express  instructions from the applicable User.</p>
<p class="p-3">Survey Respondents should refer to the User or its website to  understand the privacy practices that apply to the information that the User is  collecting. MarketTools does not review, comment upon, or monitor its Users’  compliance with their respective privacy policies. MarketTools is not  responsible to Survey Respondents for the privacy practices of Users. Survey  Respondents who provide Users with data and other information do so at their  own risk. Survey Respondents should also contact the User concerning their  ability to access and make changes to information they have provided to the  User.</p>
<p class="p-3">Our Terms of Use require that, prior to sending a survey to a  recipient other than a <a href="http://www.zoompanel.com/">ZoomPanel member</a> who has signed up to receive such surveys, a User must have an ongoing business  or personal relationship with a Survey Respondent, or the User must have  obtained the prior consent of a Survey Respondent to send emails to the Survey  Respondent through our site. Our <a href="http://info.zoomerang.com/terms.htm">Terms of Use</a> also require  the User who is sending a survey invitation or a survey to take full responsibility  for its subject matter and contents.</p>
	<p class="p-3">MarketTools does not initiate communications with Survey  Respondents of our Users’ surveys. We rely on our Users to assume  responsibility for all communications to and from their Survey Respondents,  including the protection of information they receive from Survey Respondents.</p>
	<p class="p-3">Users are responsible for informing Survey Respondents about the  purpose for which Personally Identifiable Information is collected and used,  for protecting that information once it has been collected, and for providing  clear direction on further disclosure or non disclosure of the information.  Users are responsible for providing Survey Respondents the opportunity to opt  out of receiving communications from the User through our service.</p>
 <p class="p-3">When a Survey Respondent uses the MarketTools site to fill out a  survey, our servers (which are hosted by a third-party service provider) may  collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use  of "cookies" or your "IP address") about your activities on  the site while responding to the survey. We use this browsing information, in  non-personally identifiable form, for internal purposes such as to help  understand how the site is being used and to improve it, and for systems administration  purposes.</p>
	<p class="p-3">Cookies are small pieces of information stored on a Survey  Respondent’s hard drive, not on our site. Cookies allow us to better understand  how Survey Respondents use the site, which in turn helps us focus our resources  on improvements to the site. We use session cookies, which expire when the  browser window is closed, and persistent cookies to keep track of which  survey(s) a particular Survey Respondent has answered. Zoomerang also utilizes  third-party cookies on the Zoomerang site for web analytics purpose only. A  Survey Respondent is always free to decline our cookies if her browser permits,  but in that case, the survey site may not operate properly or a Survey  Respondent may be prompted to fill out the same survey multiple times at a User’s  site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer  when it is used on a network like the Internet. In some cases the computer’s IP  address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but, for  computers connecting to the Internet via consumer Internet access providers,  the IP address generally varies from session to session.</p>
 <p class="p-3">In some cases, we enable Users to use unique identifiers, such as  unique survey ids for each survey respondent, which enables them to determine  which emails have generated responses. This allows Users to gauge the  effectiveness of certain communications and to exclude those persons who have  already responded to a certain message from duplicate messages.</p>
	<p class="p-3">MarketTools uses industry-standard security measures to protect  the integrity and confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information it  processes on behalf of Users, including, in appropriate circumstances, the use  of firewalls and restricted access. MarketTools limits access to Personally Identifiable  Information to those persons in MarketTools’ organization who have a business  need to process such Personally Identifiable Information. However, no company,  including MarketTools, can fully eliminate the security risks associated with  such information.</p>
	<p class="p-3">Due to factors beyond MarketTools’ control, MarketTools cannot  ensure that Personally Identifiable Information will not be disclosed to third  parties. For example, MarketTools may become legally obligated to disclose such  information, or, despite precautions, third parties may circumvent security  measures to intercept or access such information.</p>
<p class="p-3">If another company acquires MarketTools or substantially all of  its assets, that company will (a) possess the Personally Identifiable  Information of Survey Respondents held by MarketTools, and (b) assume the  rights and obligations regarding such information described in this Privacy  Policy. (Please see "Changes to this  Privacy Policy" section below.)</p>
	<p class="p-3">Any questions, comments, or complaints about the data practices  (including without limitation compliance with the data privacy principles of  notice, choice, onward transfer, access, security, data integrity, or  enforcement) of a User should be directed to that User. If a survey respondent  wishes to opt out of communications from the survey sender they may do so by  replying to the original survey invitation or by contacting Zoomerang at <a href="mailto:info@zoomerang.com">info@zoomerang.com</a> or Zoomerang, 150 Spear Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94105.</p>
			<h4>Part II. Users</h4>
<p class="p-3"><strong>What Personally Identifiable Information does Zoomerang  collect and what does Zoomerang do with it?</strong><br>
  Upon registration, we ask our Users to provide us with certain  Personally Identifiable Information such as their name, country of residence  and email address. We use this information to establish individual accounts and  lockers, protected by a password, that the User selects. In addition, we use  the email address supplied by the User in the registration process to confirm  registration, and to send notices and updates to the User concerning the  services and the site. We will also add the User to Zoomerang’s mailing list if  requested during registration.</p>
	<p class="p-3">Zoomerang also automatically receives and records information on  our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie  information and the page you request. This information helps us to make the  site better and more user-friendly. We also collect, with either cookies or web  logs, a User’s IP address and login times that are identified by individual  user. Finally, we collect the surveys and survey results that you have either  deployed or participated in.</p>
	<p class="p-3">NOTE TO PARENTS AND MINORS: We are committed to complying fully  with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as amended. We urge minors  to check with their parents before entering information on this or any other  web site. We do not knowingly collect information on children under the age of  13.</p>
	<p class="p-3"><strong>Does Zoomerang disclose my Personally Identifiable  Information or other information I input into the site to anyone?</strong><br>
	  We recognize that, in addition to your Personally Identifiable  Information, you may also enter other information into the Zoomerang site. Such  other information may include email lists, information about your Survey  Respondents, and other data useful to you. We do not disclose your Personally  Identifiable Information or such other information to other Users or any other  third parties, unless you expressly agree to such disclosure or it is required  by law, and except for such information that may be necessary for us to share  with our trusted internal and third-party service providers for the operation  of our business and the tracking and management of the information we collect  from you and other Users. We employ other companies to help perform functions  on our behalf. Examples include sending processing credit card transactions,  and CRM (Customer Relation Management) programs utilized by Zoomerang’s  customer service team. They have access to personal information needed to  perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </p>
	<p class="p-3">We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information or other  information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such  action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with  legal process served on MarketTools or this site; (2) protect and defend the  rights or property of MarketTools; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to  protect the personal safety of users of MarketTools, its web sites or the  public. If MarketTools (or our Zoomerang service) should ever file for  bankruptcy or merge with another company or entity, we may sell the information  you provide to us on this site to a third party or share your information with  any company with whom we merge. (Please  see “Changes to this Privacy Policy” section below.)</p>
	<p class="p-3">Please note that if we believe that you have breached the Terms of  Use for use of this site, especially with regard to our strict ban on  transmitting, publishing or distributing pornographic, obscene, offensive,  threatening, harassing, libelous, hate-oriented, harmful, defamatory, racist,  illegal or otherwise objectionable materials or content, we will report such  conduct to the appropriate authorities and turn over any and all information,  including Personally Identifiable Information and other information you have  input into the site, to appropriate law enforcement persons or entities.</p>
	<p class="p-3"><strong>How does Zoomerang store my Personally Identifiable  Information? What are the security measures?</strong><br>
	  Zoomerang stores Personally Identifiable Information and other  personal information of Users in databases protected by passwords as well as  database and network firewalls to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of  personal information. We use modern security technology to protect the personal  information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of  electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we are vigilant in  protecting the personal information that you transmit to us, we cannot  guarantee its absolute security.</p>
	<p class="p-3"><strong>Can I edit or delete my Personally Identifiable  Information on this site?</strong><br>
	  By accessing your account through the Account Information page on  our site, you may edit your Personally Identifiable Information. You can also  request that we remove your registration information from our current database  by clicking on the following <a href="http://zoomerang.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/zoomerang.cfg/php/enduser/std_alp.php">Support Link</a>. We will respond to your request within 2 business days.</p>
	<p class="p-3"><strong>Does Zoomerang do anything with survey responses?</strong><br>
	  No. We will not use or disclose any survey response information  without a User’s permission through an email or other written authorization,  except as provided above. However, Users may access surveys they have built and  their results/data through their individual accounts and lockers protected by a  password they have selected.</p>
	<p class="p-3"><strong>International Transfers</strong><br>
	Personally Identifiable Information collected on this site may be  stored and processed in the United    States or any other country in which  MarketTools or its agents, acting on behalf of MarketTools, maintain  facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of  information outside of your country. Our Privacy Policy applies to your  Personally Identifiable Information wherever we store or process it.</p>
	<p class="p-3"><strong>Third -Party Sites</strong><br>

	Please be aware that some of the Web sites you may choose to link  to from our site may collect Personally Identifiable Information and other  information about you. The practices of those Web sites concerning the  Personally Identifiable Information or other information they collect from you  are not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
				<p class="p-3"><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
				If changes are made to this policy, we will notify you of the  changes and post a notice on our site directing you to the modified policy.  Please review this site periodically to keep informed of our most current  privacy policy. As always, if you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or any  changes to it, you should cease using this site.
