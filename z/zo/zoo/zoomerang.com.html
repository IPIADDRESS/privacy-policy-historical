                        privacy and confidential information of our Users, who
                        register to build and deploy surveys and who from time
                        to time might purchase services offered by Zoomerang. We

                        <p>Our www.zoomerang.com site allows our Users to create surveys and questionnaires for distribution to potential

															recipient to send emails to a recipient through our site. Our Terms of Use also

													<p></p>
													<p>Upon registration, we ask our Users to provide us with certain Personally
														Identifiable Information such as their name, country of residence and email
														address. We use this information to establish individual accounts and lockers,
														protected by a password, that the User selects. In addition, we use the email
														address supplied by the User in the registration process to confirm
														registration, and to send notices and updates to the User concerning the
														services and the site. We will also add the User to Zoomerang's mailing list if
														requested during registration.</p>
													<p>For Panelists, we ask for some additional demographic information to determine
														their eligibility to participate in surveys requiring individuals who meet a
														specific demographic profile.</p>
													<p>Zoomerang also automatically receives and records information on our server logs
														from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information and the page
														you request. Cookies are small pieces of information that we store on a User’s
														computer(s), to recognize returning Users and to monitor traffic through the
														site. This information helps us to make the site better and more user-friendly.
														We also collect, with either cookies or web logs, a User’s IP address and login
														times that are identified by individual user. Finally, we collect the surveys
														and survey results that you have either deployed or participated in.</p>
													<p>NOTE TO PARENTS AND MINORS: We are committed to complying fully with the
														Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as amended. We urge minors to
														check with their parents before entering information on this or any other web
														site.</p>
