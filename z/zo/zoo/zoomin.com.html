        <p>
            The Publisher’s Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how the
            Publisher collects and uses the personal information you provide to the Publisher
            and to assist you in making informed decisions when using the Site and the Publisher’s
            products and services.</p>
        <h3>
            What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
        <p>
            When you visit the site you may provide the Publisher with two types of information:
            (a) personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an
            individual basis; and (b) Site use information collected on an aggregate basis as
            you and other Users browse the Site.
        </p>
        <h4>
            1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide.</h4>
        <p>
            You will provide the Publisher with your name, email address and a password when
            you register to be a User of the Site. You may also provide additional comments
            on how you see the Site servicing your needs and interests. If you choose to correspond
            with the Publisher through email, the Publisher may retain the content of your email
            messages together with your email address and the Publisher’s responses to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you make a purchase from the Site you will be required to provide the Publisher
            with your shipping and billing addresses as well as your credit card number and
            expiration date.
        </p>
        <h4>
            2. Web Site Use Information.</h4>
        <p>
            Similar to other commercial web sites, the Site utilizes a standard technology called
            “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are Cookies?”) and server logs to collect
            information about how the Site is used. Information gathered through cookies and
            server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent
            at our Site, and the web sites visited just before and just after the Site. The
            Publishers, its advertisers, advertisement serving companies and Affiliated Parties
            may also use small pieces of code called “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to determine
            which advertisements and promotions Users have seen and how Users responded to them.</p>
        <p>
            We may also use aggregate data obtained from your photos meta information to provide
            appropriate access to helpful resources relevant to your camera.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</h3>
        <p>
            Broadly speaking, the Publisher uses personal information for purposes of administering
            and expanding its business activities, providing customer service and making available
            other products and services to its customers and prospective customers. Occasionally,
            the Publisher may also use the information it collects to notify you about important
            changes to the Site and new services and special offers the Publisher thinks you
            will find valuable. You may notify the Publisher at any time if you do not wish
            to receive these offers by emailing us at our <a href="http://help.zoomin.com">Helpdesk</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Site is set up so that you can control who can view the Content and Material
            in your Account. The Publisher is committed to keeping your Content and Material
            private and secure. The Publisher will never make your Content and Material publicly
            accessible, except as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy, by your explicit authorization.
            Please note that if you choose to post a hyperlink to your Content and Material
            on your own or other’s websites, or you share your Content and Material with your
            friends or family members and they post your share invitation on a website or forward
            it to other individuals, these pictures may be accessible to others who view the
            email invitation or visit these websites. The Publisher will therefore not be liable
            for any publication of your Content and Material made otherwise than by a direct
            disclosure by the Publisher. It is clarified that mere hosting of Content and Material
            on the Site shall not be construed as a direct disclosure of such Content and Material
            without a specific reference to such Content and Material made by the Publisher
            in any communication with any third party.</p>
        <p>
            In order to provide quality products, the Publisher’s employees and third-party
            service providers fulfilling your order or providing Customer Support to you may
            view your Content and Materials.</p>
        <p>
            The Publisher permits Users to share their Content and Materials through the Site’s
            album sharing service. If you wish to share Content and Materials with friends and
            family, you will be required to provide their email addresses. An invitation with
            a hyperlink created specifically for your Content and Materials will be sent to
            them. They may view, save, or purchase products from your Content and Materials.
            The Publisher will not add their email addresses to a mailing list, or send them
            further email unless they register as Users and choose to receive such communications
            from the Publisher per this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>
            The Publisher also permits Users to refer friends to the Site. The Publisher will
            only use their email addresses to send your invitation. The Publisher will not add
            their email addresses to a mailing list, and will not send them further email unless
            they register as Users and choose to receive such communications from the Publisher
            per this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>
            Your Account contains an address book where you can store mailing and email addresses
            for your friends and family. You can use this information to quickly and easily
            share your Content and Materials and send your friends and family print products
            from your Account. The Publisher will never use the information in your address
            book for any secondary purposes.</p>
        <h3>
            What Are Cookies?</h3>
        <p>
            A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique
            identifier. When you visit a web site, that site’s computer asks your computer for
            permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated
            for cookies. Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s
            preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a
            web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent
            to you by other sites.</p>
        <h3>
            How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?
        </h3>
        <p>
            As you shop on the Site, the Site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other
            shoppers so your shopping cart is only available to you. In some cases, the Publisher
            also uses cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring
            you to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with
            the Publisher’s server log files, allow it to calculate the aggregate number of
            people visiting the Site and which parts of the Site are most popular. This helps
            the Publisher gather feedback in order to constantly improve the Site and better
            serve customers. Cookies do not allow the Publisher to gather any personal information
            about you and the Publisher does not generally store any personal information that
            you provided to it in your cookies.</p>
        <h3>
            Sharing Information with Third Parties.</h3>
        <p>
            The Publisher may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements
            with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your
            name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information
            regarding products and services that the Publisher thinks will be of interest to
            you. In connection with alliances, partnerships or arrangements, the Publisher may
            also provide certain information to third parties if it has determined in its sole
            discretion that the information will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible
            third party. For example, some of the Publisher’s partners operate stores or provide
            services on the Site, while others power offerings developed by the Publisher for
            your use. The Publisher also uses third parties to facilitate its business, including,
            but not limited to, sending email and processing credit card payments. In connection
            with these offerings and business operations, the Publisher’s partners and other
            third parties may have access to your personal information for use in connection
            with business activities. As the Publisher develops its business, it may buy or
            sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally
            one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. The Publisher
            may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers,
            or any dissolution.</p>
        <h3>
            Notice of New Services and Changes.</h3>
        <p>
            Occasionally, the Publisher may also use the information collected to notify you
            about important changes to the Site, new services and special offers the Publisher
            thinks you will find valuable. As a User, you will be given the opportunity to notify
            the Publisher of your desire not to receive these offers by sending the Publisher
            an email request via our <a href="http://help.zoomin.com">Helpdesk</a>.</p>
        <h3>
            How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</h3>
        <p>
            Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, you
            are requested not to send private information to the Publisher by email. Some of
            the information you may enter on the Site may be transmitted securely via Secure
            Sockets Layer SSL, 128-bit encryption services, which are enabled by <b><font color="red">
                Thawte DV SSL CA.</font></b> Pages utilizing this technology will have URLs
            that start with HTTPS instead of HTTP. Please visit our <a href="http://help.zoomin.com">Helpdesk</a> if you have any questions or concerns in this regard.</p>
        <h3>
            How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</h3>
        <p>
            You can update your Account information and change your password from the ‘My Account’
            page. If you have forgotten your password, you can set a new one by clicking on
            the ‘Forgot Password’ link on the Site’s sign-in page.</p>
        <h3>
            Certain Disclosures.</h3>
        <p>
            The Publisher may disclosure your personal information if required to do so by law
            or if the Publisher believes that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the
            law or comply with legal process served on the Publisher or its Affiliated Parties;
            (b) protect and defend the Publisher’s rights and property, the Site, the users
            of the Site, and/or its Affiliated Parties; or (c) act under circumstances to protect
            the safety of Users of the Site, the Publisher, or third parties.</p>
        <h3>
            What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</h3>
        <p>
            The Publisher is not responsible for the practices employed by web sites hyperlinked
            to or from the Site nor the information or content contained therein. Often hyperlinks
            to other web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that
            may be useful to the users of the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Site to another web site,
            this Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any
            other web site, including web sites which have a link on the Site, is subject to
            that web site’s own rules and policies and the Publisher has no liability whatsoever
            in that connection.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Your Consent.</h3>
        <p>
            By using the Site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information
            as described in this Privacy Policy. If the Publisher changes its Privacy Policy
            and procedures, the Publisher will post those changes on the Site to keep you aware
            of what information the Publisher collects, how such information is used and under
            what circumstances the Publisher may disclose it.</p>
