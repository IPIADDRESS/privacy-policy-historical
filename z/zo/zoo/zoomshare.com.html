This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the Site or as we incorporate suggestions from our users. If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information, you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner.

<ul>
	<li><strong>Order and Payment Processing, Customer Service, Credit Card Issuers and Quality Assurance:</strong> We use contact information to help us efficiently perform transactions, to deliver the services you have requested, to perform quality assurance, sales analyses and other business analyses, and to contact you in connection with any orders that you have placed with us.

<br><br>
<div class="subhead">5. Use of Cookies and Other Site Tracking Data</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Cookies:</strong> A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer's hard drive that contains non-personal information. These cookies help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited. They also allow you to personalize your pages, and optimize your experience at our sites. We also use cookies to help us figure out how many people visit our sites, which of our web pages they visit, and how long they stay there. This information helps us figure out which of our web features are highly successful and which sites might need improvement. You can disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but allow you to disable them. Disabling cookies may prevent you from properly using the Services or accessing the site.
		<ul>
			<li>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our sites.<br>
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on your visit to the zoomshare sites and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by <span class="textLink"><a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy</a></span>. </li>
		</ul>
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Session IDs:</strong> "Session IDs" allow us to identify a particular user across multiple web page requests. This Session ID is maintained within your cookie file, where possible. If cookies are not enabled, or if The  user's internet browser program does not support cookies then Zoomshare.com  will place the Session ID in the requested web page. This allows the end user to avoid having to continually re-enter certain  information such as account name and password for every web page request. This Session ID expires whenever the user closes their internet browser. </li>
	<li><strong>Web Site Tracking, Reporting:</strong> Many of our web pages also contain special electronic images (called a "single-pixel gif" or "gifs") that allow us to gather only non-personally identifiable traffic statistics and other aggregate information about visitors to our sites. Zoomshare.com  (through itself or third parties) uses this technology to collect and accumulate anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the experience of people visiting our web sites and, along with other information you provide, customize your future visits and improve our web sites. For example, we capture data on the type of browser used, operating system software (e.g. Windows 95 vs. 98 or Macintosh), cookie preferences (whether the user has them turned on or off), and search engine keywords (what key words did a visitor use to get to our site). We also record number of visits, paths taken, and time spent on sites and pages within Zoomshare.com's web sites. Please keep in mind that none of this information is personally identifiable and that we only distribute this information to internal staff at Zoomshare.com</li>
	<li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Each time you visit the Site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the Site for you and to diagnose problems with our Site, we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. </li>
	<li><strong>Banner Ads:</strong> The Services may include the use of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third party ad service provider. The ad service provider may place or utilize their own unique cookie on your browser, and may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our sites, such as the number of times you have viewed the ad. Zoomshare.com is not responsible for the collection of these cookies and is not responsible for the actions of the ad service providers. Zoomshare.com does not sponsor, endorse or guarantee any products or services advertised by third parties on its site. </li>
	<li>These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
</li>
	<li><strong>Direct Linking URLs or Hotlinking:</strong> In order to provide more relevant advertising and monitor user bandwidth usage (as governed by the Zoomshare.com Terms of Service), Zoomshare.com  may gather data from the referer logs that identify where and how frequently user images being hosted by Zoomshare.com are being displayed on third party sites. </li>
</ul>

<div class="subhead">6. Information from Other Sites</div>
Zoomshare.com may place links to other web sites operated by other parties and from time to time may include information and links to third party web sites in our promotional email. Some of these other web sites contain our brand names and trademarks and other intellectual property that we own; others do not. When you click on these links and visit these other web sites, regardless of whether or not they contain our brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware that we do not control these other web sites or these other web sites' business practices, and that this privacy policy does not apply to these other web sites. Consequently, the operators of these other web sites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it were collected on the Site. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions. 
<br><br>
<div class="subhead">7. Non-US Users</div>
If you are not a resident of the United States, you understand and agree that Zoomshare.com stores and processes your information on computers located in the United States, and by providing any data to Zoomshare.com, you consent to the transfer of such information to the United States. 
<br><br>
<div class="subhead">8. Security Precautions</div>
Zoomshare.com has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We use secure socket layer (SSL) technology to help protect the security of commerce transactions. We encrypt your contact information and financial information as it travels over the Internet and we store your financial information on our servers in encrypted form. Your information may be transferred to and maintained in whole or in part on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and may be stored on equipment or in facilities leased or licensed from third parties. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information and make all commercially reasonable efforts to do so, Zoomshare.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. This privacy policy does not apply to any information, including such photographs, that you submit for use in publicly available areas. We ask that you do not submit any personal information, including contact information or financial information, for display in public areas, as other people who use the Services will see it. If you submit such information for display in public areas, Zoomshare.com  cannot prevent it from being used in a manner that violates the law, your personal privacy or your safety. By submitting such information for display in public areas, you assume the risks and sole liability arising as a result of such information being displayed. 
<br><br>
