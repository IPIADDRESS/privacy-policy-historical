						<p class="dw_bighead">Privacy Policy</p>

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for DigitalWork and its partners.<br><br>

<p class="dw_subhead">Order Data</p>
DigitalWork Inc. requests information from users on its order form. Here a user must provide contact information such as name and shipping address, and payment information such as credit card number and expiration date if applicable. This information is used to fulfill customer orders. This contact information is used to notify users of changes in status to their orders as well as new features and benefits available to them.<br><br>

<p class="dw_subhead">Cookies</p>
A "cookie" is a text file with a unique identifier that is placed on your hard disk by a web site's server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by the web site that issued the cookie to you. We do not use cookies to track personally identifiable information on this site. We use cookies to help our web servers maintain your current session as you go from one page to another as well as to track any discounts or special offers you are entitled to. Without these cookies, our web site would not be able to keep track of your shopping cart contents, for example.<br><br>

<p class="dw_subhead">Log Files</p>
DigitalWork Inc. uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement and gather demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personal information.<br><br>

<p class="dw_subhead">Links</p>
This web site may contain links to other sites. DigitalWork Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects personal information.<br><br>

<p class="dw_subhead">Security</p>
This web site takes every precaution to protect user information. When users submit sensitive information on the web site, we protect it both online and offline.<br><br>

When our registration or order form asks users to enter sensitive information, such as credit card number and social security number, that information is encrypted and protected with secure encryption software in the industry, known as SSL. While on a secure web page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers – including Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer – becomes locked. When users resume 'surfing,' the lock icon unlocks or opens.<br><br>

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also help protect user information offline. All user information – not only the sensitive information mentioned above – is restricted within our offices. Only employees performing a specific task such as billing or customer service can gain access to personal information.<br><br>

If you have any questions about our web site's security, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:customerservice@digitalwork.com">customerservice@digitalwork.com</a><br><br>

<p class="dw_subhead">Supplementation of Information</p>
To tailor our web site to a user's particular preference, we combine information about user purchasing habits with similar information from our partners. When users make a purchase on or through our web site, their information is collected and shared with DigitalWork Inc. so we can continue to enhance user experience.<br><br>

<p class="dw_subhead">Correcting and Updating Personal Information</p>
If a user's personal information changes, or if a user no longer needs our service, we will provide a way to correct, update or remove that user data. This ucan be done by emailing customer support at <a href="mailto:customerservice@digitalwork.com">customerservice@digitalwork.com</a>.<br><br>

<p class="dw_subhead">Notification of Changes</p>
DigitalWork Inc. will post any privacy policy changes on its homepage, so our users know what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we ever use personal information in a manner other than that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. Users either can accept or decline the use of their information in this different manner.<br><br>
