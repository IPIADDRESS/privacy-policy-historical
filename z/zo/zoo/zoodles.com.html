<p><font size="3" face="Arial">As used in this policy, the terms “using”
  and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer,
  subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using
  or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting,
  storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing
  and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates
  within the United States or internationally.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Information Collection and Use</b></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Our primary goals in collecting information
  are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content,
  to administer your Account (as defined below) (together, the “<b><i>Service</i></b>”)
  and to enable members to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Personally Identifiable Information</u>.</i>  </font> <br>
</p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Arial">When you register with us
    through the Site, as an Inquisitive Minds Parent (“<b><i>Inquisitive
    Minds</i></b> <b><i>Parent</i></b>”), or when you choose to add information
    to your profile we will ask you for personally identifiable information.
    This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or
    identify you (“<b><i>Personal Information</i></b>”).  Personal
    Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address,
    home address, payment information, phone number and certain information
    related to your social networks.  We use your Personal Information
    mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.  As membership
    accounts are held by Inquisitive Minds Parents (“<b><i>Accounts</i></b>”
    or “<b><i>Account</i></b>”), and not their children, the only information
    we retain about your child is that information which you choose to provide
    within the context of your Account so that we may provide the Site and
    the Services.  For example, this information may include, but is not
    limited to, your child’s first name and month and year of birth. </font></li>

</ul>
<br>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Arial">We also collect the other
    information that you provide as part of registration and the administration
    and personalization of your profile page (<i>e.g.</i>, without limitation,
    zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) (“<b><i>Non-Identifying
    Information</i></b>”).</font></li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Arial">We use your Personal Information

    mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries. </font></li>

</ul>
<br>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Arial">Certain Non-Identifying Information
    would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined
    with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your
    street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.  <i>
    But </i>the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying
    Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying
    Information (for example, your viewing preferences).  We may combine
    your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate
    it with information collected from other Inquisitive Minds Parents to
    attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality
    and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site
    and Service are used.  We may also use the combined information
    without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver
    a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions. </font></li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Arial">Certain data is collected
    and analyzed while you or your child is using the Inquisitive Minds
    Browser.  This data is used to provide and improve the Service and includes,
    but is not limited to, URLs visited, time of visit, and errors encountered.  </font></li>

</ul>
<br>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Arial">We also use your Personal
    Information to contact you with Inquisitive Minds Parents marketing
    or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest
    to you, including but not limited to, parental updates on your child’s
    learning and progress.  If you decide at any time that you no longer
    wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe
    instructions provided in any of the communications or update your “member
    preferences” information.  (See “<b>Changing or Deleting Information</b>,”
    below.)  </font></li>
</ul>
<br> <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Log Data</u>.  </i>
  When you visit the Site, whether as an Inquisitive Minds Parent or a
  non-registered member just browsing (any of these, a <b>“<i>User</i>”</b>),
  our servers automatically record information that your browser sends
  whenever you visit a website (<b><i>“Log Data”</i></b>).  This
  Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet
  Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting
  before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time
  spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access
  times and dates, and other statistics.  We use this information
  to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site’s
  technical administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and
  user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs.
  For example, some of this information is collected so that when you
  visit the Site again, it will recognize you and serve information appropriate
  to your interests.  We also use this information to verify that
  visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.
  We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association
  with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and
  evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding
  other Non-Identifying Information.  </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Cookies</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Like many websites, we use “cookies”
  to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we
  transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
  We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent
  cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins
  to the Site.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain
  features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the
  Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Users and web traffic routing
  on the Site.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted
  from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then
  close your browser.  Third party advertisers on the Site may also
  place or read cookies on your browser.<b> </b>
  You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting
  cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites
  you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not
  be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the
  Service. </font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Phishing</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Identity theft and the practice currently
  known as “phishing” are of great concern to Inquisitive Minds.
  Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is
  a top priority.  We do not and will not, at any time, request your
  credit card information, your Account ID, login password, or national
  identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone
  communication.  For more information about phishing, visit the
  Federal Trade Commission’s website.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure
</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Inquisitive Minds</u></i><u> </u>
  <i><u>Parents</u></i>.  <a name="0.1_OLE_LINK1"></a><a name="0.1_OLE_LINK2"></a>When you
  register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to create
  a profile page, other Inquisitive Minds Parents will see your “Screen
  Name.”  You can choose what other Personal Information you provide
  as part of your profile (“<b><i>Other Member Information</i></b>”).
  Providing Other Member Information is voluntary and should correlate
  with the degree of interaction you want to have with other Inquisitive
  Minds Parents.  We recommend that you guard your anonymity and
  sensitive information, and that of your children, and that you not use
  your real name as your “Screen Name,” since that would allow others
  to identify you.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying
  Information</u></i>.  We may share aggregated information that
  includes Personal Information and certain non-identifying data collected
  through the Inquisitive Minds Browser and we may otherwise disclose
  Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry
  analysis, demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising
  about other products and services. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Service Providers</u></i>.
  We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our
  Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related
  services (<i>e.g.</i>, without limitation, maintenance services, database
  management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s features)
  or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used.
  These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to
  perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose
  or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information
  to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of
  providing you with information on goods or services we believe will
  be of interest to you.  You can, at any time, opt out of receiving
  such communications.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</u></i>.
  Inquisitive Minds cooperates with government and law enforcement officials
  and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will
  disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement
  officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe
  necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including
  but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of
  Inquisitive Minds or a third party, to protect the safety of the public
  or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be,
  or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical or legally actionable
  activity. </font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Business Transfers</u></i>.
  Inquisitive Minds may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all
  of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with
  a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event
  of bankruptcy.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Changing or Deleting Your Information</b></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">All Inquisitive Minds Parents may review,
  update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration
  profile by accessing their Account management page.  If you completely
  delete all such information, then your Account may become deactivated.
  If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact
  us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have
  any legal obligation to retain the record.  See below for privacy
  contact information.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Security </b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Inquisitive Minds is very concerned with
  safeguarding your information.  We employ administrative, physical
  and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized
  access.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">We will make any legally required disclosures
  of any  breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of
  your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined
  in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you
  via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient
  time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent
  with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures
  necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable
  integrity of the data system. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>International Transfer</b></font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Your information may be transferred to
  — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province,
  country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may
  not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are
  located outside the United States and choose to provide information
  to us, Inquisitive Minds transfers Personal Information to the United
  States and processes it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy
  followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement
  to that transfer. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Links to Other Sites</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Our Site, Service and the Application
  contain links to, and may allow you to visit, other websites (“<b><i>Third
  Party Sites</i></b>”).  If you choose to visit any of these Third
  Party Sites by “clicking on” another third party link or navigating
  to a Third Party Site, you will be directed to that third party’s
  website.  The fact that we link to a website or present a banner
  ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization
  or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it
  an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or
  practices.  We do not exercise control over third party websites.
  These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your
  computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
  Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of
  the personal information you submit to them.  We encourage you
  to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you
  visit.  </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Inquisitive Minds Accounts are held by
  parents, as such, this Site is not directed to members under 18. We

  whenever you visit a website (<b><i>“Log Data”</i></b>).  This
  Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet
  Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting
  before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time
  spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access
  times and dates, and other statistics.  We use this information
  to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site’s
  technical administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and
  user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs.
  For example, some of this information is collected so that when you
  visit the Site again, it will recognize you and serve information appropriate
  to your interests.  We also use this information to verify that
  visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.
  We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association
  with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and
  evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding
  other Non-Identifying Information.  </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Cookies</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Like many websites, we use “cookies”
  to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we
  transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
  We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent
  cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins
  to the Site.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain
  features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the
  Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Users and web traffic routing
  on the Site.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted
  from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then
  close your browser.  Third party advertisers on the Site may also
  place or read cookies on your browser.<b> </b>
  You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting
  cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites
  you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not
  be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the
  Service. </font> <br></p>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Identity theft and the practice currently
  known as “phishing” are of great concern to Inquisitive Minds.
  Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is
  a top priority.  We do not and will not, at any time, request your
  credit card information, your Account ID, login password, or national
  identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone
  communication.  For more information about phishing, visit the
  Federal Trade Commission’s website.</font> <br></p>

  <i><u>Parents</u></i>.  <a name="0.1_OLE_LINK1"></a><a name="0.1_OLE_LINK2"></a>When you
  register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to create
  a profile page, other Inquisitive Minds Parents will see your “Screen
  Name.”  You can choose what other Personal Information you provide
  as part of your profile (“<b><i>Other Member Information</i></b>”).
  Providing Other Member Information is voluntary and should correlate
  with the degree of interaction you want to have with other Inquisitive
  Minds Parents.  We recommend that you guard your anonymity and
  sensitive information, and that of your children, and that you not use
  your real name as your “Screen Name,” since that would allow others
  to identify you.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying
  Information</u></i>.  We may share aggregated information that

  analysis, demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising
  about other products and services. </font> <br></p>

  services (<i>e.g.</i>, without limitation, maintenance services, database
  management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s features)
  or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used.
  These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to
  perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose
  or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information
  to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of
  providing you with information on goods or services we believe will
  be of interest to you.  You can, at any time, opt out of receiving
  such communications.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</u></i>.
  Inquisitive Minds cooperates with government and law enforcement officials
  and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will
  disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement
  officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe
  necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including
  but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of
  Inquisitive Minds or a third party, to protect the safety of the public
  or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be,
  or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical or legally actionable
  activity. </font> <br></p>

  of bankruptcy.</font> <br></p>
