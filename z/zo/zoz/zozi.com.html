<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
ekoVenture, Inc. ("Company") doing business as (DBA) zozi, knows that you care about how your personal information
is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy
policy. By visiting the www.zozi.com website and domain name, or otherwise accessing any other linked pages,
features, content, or services offered from time to time by Company in connection therewith (collectively,
the "Website"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>What does this privacy policy cover?</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy covers Company's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that
Company gathers when you access the Website and when you use Company's services.  This policy does not apply to the
practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.
</p>
<h2>What personal information does company collect?</h2>
<p>
The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following
types of information from our customers:
</p>
<h4>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</h4>
<p>
We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. The types of
Personal Information collected include your full name, credit card information, email address, zip code,
IP address, browser information, username, password, historical purchase data and any other information
necessary for us to provide our services. The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes
as responding to your requests for certain services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with
you about new services.
</p>
<h4>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services.
Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address,
cookie information, and the page you requested.
</li>
<li>
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to
our Website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.
Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would
identify you personally.  This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the
Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those
services.  As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our
customers, collectively, use our Website or services.  We share this type of statistical data so that our partners
also understand how often people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal
online experience. Again, Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify
you personally.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>E-mail Communications:</h4>
<p>
We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer supports this type of program.
Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful.  When you receive e-mail from
Company, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.
</p>
<h4>What About Cookies?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable
our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people.
We use cookies to enhance visitors' experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve the
quality of our services.
</li>
<li>
Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new
cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance
of each new cookie in a variety of ways.  We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because
cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website's most attractive features.
</li>
<li>
Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use
of cookies by Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
</li>
