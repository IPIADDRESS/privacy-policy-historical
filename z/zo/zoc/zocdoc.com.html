<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>ZocDoc, Inc. (“us,” “we,” or <b>“ZocDoc”</b>) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our customers, visitors, and other users of ZocDoc.com (the <b>“Site”</b>) and related websites, applications, 
    services and mobile applications provided by ZocDoc and on/in which this Privacy Policy is posted or referenced (collectively, the <b>“Services”</b>). We created this Privacy Policy (<b>“Privacy Policy”</b>)
    to give you confidence as you use the Services and to demonstrate our commitment to the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Services.  
    This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website or digital service that you may be able to access through the Services or any website or digital services of ZocDoc’s business partners, 
    each of which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that may materially differ from this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Services is governed by
    this Privacy Policy and our <u><a href="/terms/updated">Terms of Use.</a></u>  Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning in our <u><a href="/terms/updated">Terms of Use.</a></u>
</p>

<p>BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE PRACTICES AND POLICIES OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO OUR TRACKING, COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU CANNOT USE THE SERVICES.  IF YOU USE THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE ELSE (SUCH AS YOUR CHILD)  OR AN ENTITY (SUCH AS YOUR EMPLOYER), YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED BY SUCH INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY TO ACCEPT THIS PRIVACY POLICY ON SUCH INDIVIDUAL'S OR ENTITY'S BEHALF.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<div class="sg-h3">2.1 Personal Information</div>
<p>    (a) Generally.  Some of the Services require us to know who you are so that we can best meet your needs.  When you access these Services, we may ask you to voluntarily provide us with certain information that personally identifies (or could be used to personally identify) you (“Personal Information”).  Personal Information includes (but is not limited to) the following categories of information: (1) contact data (such as your e-mail address, and phone number and other unique identifiers such as passwords); (2) demographic data (such as your gender, your date of birth and your zip code); (3) insurance data (such as your insurance carrier and insurance plan); (4) medical data (such as the doctors, dentists or other health care providers (“Healthcare Providers”) you have visited, your reason for visiting Healthcare Providers, your date of visiting Healthcare Providers, your medical history, and other medical and health information you choose to share with us), and (5) other information that you voluntarily choose to provide to us, such as Personal Information in emails or letters that you send to us.  You may still access and use some of the Services if you choose not to provide us with any Personal Information, but the features of the Services that require your Personal Information will not be accessible to you.</p>
<p>(b) Billing, Collection and Payment Information.
When you pay for a Healthcare Provider’s services through our Services, your payment card information is processed by our payment processing partner, Stripe (https://stripe.com).  Stripe collects your voluntarily provided payment card information necessary to process your payment. Stripe’s use and storage of information it collects is governed by Stripe’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy.  The information we store includes your payment card type and the last four digits of the payment card.  We may provide to you the option to remove your stored payment card information through your account settings page.
</p>

<div class="sg-h3">2.2 Traffic Data</div>
<p> We also may automatically collect certain data when you use the Services, such as (1) IP address; (2) domain server; (3) type of device(s) used to access the Services; (4) web browser(s) used to access the Services; (5) referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Services; (6) geolocation information; and (7) other statistics and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Services (collectively “Traffic Data”).  Depending on applicable law, some Traffic Data may be Personal Information.</p>
<p>We may also collect additional information, which may be Personal Information, as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.</p>

<div class="sg-h3">2.3 HIPAA and PHI</div>
<p>Under a federal law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), some of the demographic, health and/or health-related information that ZocDoc collects as part of providing the Services may be considered “protected health information” or “PHI”.  Specifically, when ZocDoc receives identifiable information about you from or on behalf of your Healthcare Providers, this information is PHI.  HIPAA provides specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and restricts how PHI is used and disclosed.  ZocDoc may only use and disclose your PHI in the ways permitted by your Healthcare Provider(s).  In addition, you have been or will be asked to e-sign the ZocDoc User Authorization (the “ZocDoc Authorization”).  Your decision to e-sign the ZocDoc Authorization is entirely voluntary.  If you choose to e-sign the ZocDoc Authorization, you agree that ZocDoc may use and disclose your PHI in the same way it uses and discloses your Personal Information that is not PHI.  These uses and disclosures are described in this Privacy Policy.  To the extent any provision in the ZocDoc Authorization is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or our <u><a href="/terms/updated">Terms of Use</a></u> , then the provision in the ZocDoc Authorization only controls with respect to your PHI.  If you do not e-sign the ZocDoc Authorization, then your Personal Information that is not PHI is governed by this Privacy Policy and your Personal Information that is PHI is used and disclosed only as permitted by your Healthcare Provider(s).  
</p>

<h2>3. How We Collect Information </h2>
<div class="p">We collect information, including Personal Information and Traffic Data, when you use and interact with the Services, such as: </div>
<ul class="bullet-list">
 <li class="p">When you use the Services’ interactive tools and services, such as searching for Healthcare Providers, searching for available appointments with Healthcare Providers and completing medical history forms ("Medical History Forms") prior to Healthcare Provider appointments; </li>
 <li class="p">When you voluntarily provide information in free-form text boxes through the Services and through responses to surveys, questionnaires and the like; </li>
 <li class="p">If you download and install certain applications and software we make available, we may receive and collect information transmitted from your computing device for the purpose of providing you the relevant Services, such as information that lets ZocDoc know when you are logged on and available to receive update or alert notices; </li>
 <li class="p">If you download our mobile application, we may receive information about your location and mobile device;</li>
 <li class="p">Through cookies, web beacons, website analytics services and other tracking technology (collectively, “Tracking Tools”), as described below; and</li>
 <li class="p">When you use the “Contact Us” function on the Site, send us an email or otherwise contact us.</li>   
</ul>
<p>We also may collect information about you from third party sources.</p>

<div class="sg-h2">4. Tracking Tools and “Do Not Track”</div>
<div class="sg-h3">4.1. Tracking Tools. The Tracking Tools that we may use and how we may use them include:</div>
<ul class="bullet-list">
    <li class="p"><b>Cookies:</b> “Cookies” are small computer files transferred to your computer's or tablet’s hard drive that contain information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited and activities conducted while using the Services.  We use Cookies to help us improve the Services by tracking your navigation habits, storing your authentication status so you do not have to re-enter your credentials each time you use the Services, customizing your experience with the Services and for analytics and fraud prevention.
        <span class="p2">Some of our business partners use Cookies to show ZocDoc ads on other websites and services based on information collected about your use of the Services and based on your particular interests (as inferred from your online activity).  This type of advertising is commonly known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising.  Other Cookies used by our business partners may collect information when you use the Services, such as the computer’s IP address, mobile device ID, type of operating system, type of internet browsing software, web pages viewed and when, the geographic location of your internet service provider and demographic information, such as gender and age range.  These third-party Cookies help ZocDoc learn more about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors.</span>
        <span class="p2">For more information on cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. </span>
    </li>
    <li class="p"><b>Web Beacons: </b>
        “Web Beacons” (a.k.a. clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or email that may be used to collect anonymous information about your use of our Services, the websites of selected advertisers and the emails, special promotions or newsletters that we send you. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to monitor how many people are using the Services, using the selected advertisers' websites or opening our emails, and for what purpose, and also allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising.
    </li>
    <li class="p"><b>Website Analytics: </b>
        We may use third-party website analytics services in connection with the Services, including, for example, to record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity and text that you type into the Site. These website analytics services generally do not collect Personal Information unless you voluntarily provide it and generally do not track your browsing habits across websites which do not use their services.  We use the information collected from these services to help make the Services easier to use. 
    </li>
    <li class="p"><b>Mobile Device Identifiers:  </b>
        Mobile device identifiers are data stored on your mobile device that can be used to track your mobile device and data and activities occurring on and through it, as well as the applications installed on it.  Mobile device identifiers enable collection of Personal Information (such as media access control, address and location) and Traffic Data.  As with other Tracking Tools, mobile device identifiers help ZocDoc learn more about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors.  
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="sg-h3">4.2. How ZocDoc Responds to Browser “Do Not Track” Signals.  </div>
<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked.  If a website operator that elects to respond to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the website operator may refrain from collecting certain Personal Information about the browser’s user.  Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal.  For these reasons, many website operators, including ZocDoc, do not take action to respond to DNT signals.  For more information about DNT signals, visit http://allaboutdnt.com.</p>

<div class="sg-h3">4.3. Options for Opting out of Cookies and Mobile Device Identifiers. </div>
<p>Some web browsers (including some mobile web browsers) allow you to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your computer, tablet or mobile device.  You may be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. Although you are not required to accept ZocDoc’s Cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through the Services.  </p>
<p>You may opt out of receiving certain Cookies and certain trackers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) consumer opt-out page.  When you use these opt-out features, an “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your computer or tablet indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertising from NAI or DAA member companies.  If you delete Cookies on your computer or tablet, you may need to opt out again.  For information about how to opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile device identifiers, please visit http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device.  Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean you will no longer see ZocDoc’s advertisements; rather, opting out means that the advertisements that you do see are not interest-based advertisements.  Also, opting out does not mean that ZocDoc is no longer using Tracking Tools -- ZocDoc still may collect information about your use of the Services even after you have opted out of interest-based advertisements.</p>

<div class="sg-h2">5. Information Provided by or on Behalf of Children</div>
<p>The Services are not intended for use by children and children are prohibited from using the Services.  ZocDoc does not knowingly collect any information from children, nor are the Services directed to children.  </p>
<p>By accessing, using and/or submitting information to or through the Services, you represent that you are not younger than age 13. If we learn that we have received any information directly from a child under age 13 without his/her parent’s written consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his/her parent or legal guardian) to inform the child that he/she cannot use the Services and subsequently we will delete that information.</p>
<p>If you are between age thirteen (13) and the age of majority in your place of residence, you may use the Services only with the consent of or under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, you may, in compliance with our Terms of Use, use the Services on behalf of such minor child.  Any information that you provide us while using the Services on behalf of your minor child will be treated as Personal Information as otherwise provided herein.</p>

<div class="sg-h2">6. Use of Information</div>
<div class="p">We use your information, including Personal Information, to provide the Services to you and to help improve them, including to: </div>
<ul class="bullet-list">
    <li class="p">provide you with the products, services and information you request and respond to correspondence that we receive from you;</li>
    <li class="p">provide, maintain, administer or expand the Services, perform business analyses, or for other internal purposes to support, improve or enhance our business, the Services, and other products and services we offer;</li>
	<li class="p">notify you about certain resources or Healthcare Providers we think you may be interested in learning more; </li>
	<li class="p">send you information about ZocDoc or our products or Services; </li>

	<li class="p">send emails and other communications that display content that we think will interest you and according to your preferences; </li>
	<li class="p">combine information received from third parties with the information that we have from or about you and use the combined information for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy;</li>

<p>We may use information that is neither Personal Information nor PHI (including non-PHI Personal Information that has been de-identified and/or aggregated) for any reason at our sole discretion.</p>

<div class="sg-h2">7. Disclosure of Information</div>
<div class="sg-p">We may disclose certain information that we collect from you:</div>
<ul class="bullet-list">
    <li class="p">	We may share your Personal Information with Healthcare Providers with which you choose to schedule through the Services.  For example, if you elect to complete a Medical History Form using the Services in advance of an appointment, we may share your Medical History Form with your Healthcare Providers.  You also may choose to store but not share with ZocDoc your Medical History Form.</li>
<li class="p">	We may share your Personal Information with your Healthcare Providers to enable them to refer you to and make appointments with other Healthcare Providers on your behalf or to perform analyses on potential health issues or treatments, provided that you choose to use the applicable Services.</li>
<li class="p">	We may share your Personal Information with Healthcare Providers in the event of an emergency. </li>
<li class="p">	We may also share your Personal Information with organizations that collect, aggregate and organize your information so they can make it more easily accessible to your Healthcare Providers.</li>
<li class="p">	We may share your email address with our business partners solely to enable them to help ZocDoc customize our advertising, e.g., to enable us to contact you on non-ZocDoc websites. We do not sell email addresses to third parties.</li>
<li class="p">	We may share your Personal Information and Traffic Data with our business partners who perform core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Services and/or by making certain features available to our users.  </li>
<li class="p">	We may transfer information about you, including your Personal Information, to another company in connection with a merger, sale, acquisition or other change of ownership or control by or of ZocDoc (whether in whole or in part).  When one of these events occurs, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to different privacy and security policies and practices.  </li>
</ul>
<p>We also may need to disclose your Personal Information or any other information we collect about you if we determine in good faith that such disclosure is needed to: (1) comply with applicable law, regulation, court order or other legal process; (2) protect the rights, property or safety of ZocDoc or another party; (3) enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements with you; or (4) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates third-party rights.</p>
<p>We may disclose information that is neither Personal Information nor PHI (including non-PHI Personal Information that has been de-identified and/or aggregated) for any reason at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>We store and process your information on our servers in the United States and in other countries. We may store all information indefinitely.   </p>

<div class="sg-h2">8. Public Information</div>
<p>Any information that you may reveal in a review posting or online discussion or forum is intentionally open to the public and is not in any way private. We recommend that you carefully consider whether to disclose any Personal Information in any public posting or forum. What you have written may be seen and/or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict.</p>

<div class="sg-h2">9. Storage and Security of Information</div>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We endeavor to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage. For example, when you enter sensitive information on our Site, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology.</p>
<p>Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, we do not and cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information. If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted or required by law.

</p>
<div class="sg-h2">10. Controlling Your Personal Information</div>
<p>If you are a registered user of the Services, you can modify some of the Personal Information you have included in your profile or change your username by logging in and accessing your account.  If you wish to close your account, please email us at privacy@zocdoc.com.  ZocDoc will delete your account and the information in your account as soon as reasonably possible.  Please note, however, that ZocDoc reserves the right to retain information from closed accounts, including to comply with law, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce our <u><a href="/terms/updated">Terms of Use</a></u>  and take other actions permitted by law.   </p>
<p>You must promptly notify us if any of your account data is lost, stolen or used without permission.</p>

<div class="sg-h2">11. Links to Other Websites</div>
<p>The Services contain links to third party websites with which ZocDoc has no affiliation. A link to a non-ZocDoc website does not mean that we endorse that website, the quality or accuracy of information presented on the non-ZocDoc website or the persons or entities associated with the non-ZocDoc website. If you decide to visit a third party website, you are subject to the privacy policy of the third party website as applicable and we are not responsible for the policies and practices of the third party website. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your information to others. </p>

<div class="sg-h2">12. Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy</div>
<p>The effective date of this Privacy Policy is set forth at the top of this webpage.  We will notify you of any material change by posting notice on this webpage.  Your continued use of the Services after the effective date constitutes your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy.  We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.  The amended Privacy Policy supersedes all previous versions.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO FUTURE CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST STOP USING THE SERVICES AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH CHANGES.</p>
