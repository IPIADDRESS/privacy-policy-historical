<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.zocdoc.com&amp;sealid=101"><img src="/images/truste_seal_ctv.gif"></a></p>
<h2>1. Introduction </h2>

<p>ZocDoc, Inc. (“us,” “we,” or 
“ZocDoc”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our customers, 
visitors, and other users of the ZocDoc services (“Services”) provided 
via the ZocDoc website (collectively, “Website"). We created 
this Website Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to give you confidence 
as you visit and use the Website, and to demonstrate our commitment 
to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Privacy 
Policy is only applicable to the Website, and not to any other websites 
that you may be able to access from the Website or any website of ZocDoc’s 
partners, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices 
and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.  
Your use of the Website is governed by this Privacy Policy and the <a href="/public/terms.aspx" style="text-decoration:underline;">
Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Traffic Data Collected</h2>
<p>We automatically track and collect the 
following categories of information when you visit our Website: (1) 
IP addresses; (2) domain servers; (3) types of computers accessing the 
Website; (4) types of web browsers used to access the Website; (5) referring 
source which may have sent you to the Website; and (6) other information 
associated with the interaction of your browser and the Website (collectively 
“Traffic Data”). </p>

<h2>3. Personal Information Collected</h2>
<p>In order for you to access certain 
areas of the Website, we may require you to provide us with certain 
information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”). 
Personal Information includes the following categories of information: 
(1) Contact Data (such as your e-mail address, phone number and ZocDoc 
password); (2) Demographic Data (such as 
your gender, your date of birth and 
your zip code); (3) Insurance Data (such as your insurance carrier and 
insurance plan); and (4) Medical Data (such as your previous doctors 
and dentists (“Providers”) visited, your reason for visit and your 
date of visit, and other medical information you choose to share with 
us). If you communicate with us by, for example, e-mail or letter, any 
information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal 
Information. </p>

<h2>4. Interactive and Installed Tools</h2>
<p>We also collect other information, 
some of which may be Personal Information that you voluntarily provide 
to us when you choose to use some of the Website’s interactive tools 
and services (“Interactive Tools”), such as searching for Providers 
and appointments with them. We also collect information you provide 
voluntarily in free-form text boxes on the Website and 
through responses to surveys, questionnaires and the like. Some of the 
free Interactive Tools on our site ask you for health-related Personal 
Information.  You may elect to use certain 
Services available through the Website that require you to download 
and install software on your computer (“Installed Tools”).  
The Installed Tools may collect and transmit information from your 
computer system solely relating to use of the Installed Tools and for 
the purpose of providing you the relevant 
Services, for example, by informing ZocDoc when a user is logged on 
and available to receive update or alert notices.</p>

<h2>5. Cookies</h2>
<p>We use “cookies” to customize your 
experience on our Website and to store your password so you do not have 
to re-enter it each time you visit the Website.  Some of our business 
partners also use cookies to provide us with anonymous data and information 
regarding the use of our Website.  We do not link the information 
stored in cookies directly to any of your Personal information you submit 
while on the Website, however.  “Cookies” are small computer 
files that are transferred to your computer's hard drive that contain 
information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited 
and activities conducted while browsing the Website. At your option, 
expense and responsibility, you may block cookies or delete cookies 
from your hard drive. However, by disabling cookies, you may not have 
access to the entire set of features of the Website.</p>

<h2>6. Web Beacons</h2>
<p>In limited circumstances we also may 
use “Web Beacons” to collect anonymous, non-personal information 
about your use of our Website and the sites of selected sponsors and 
advertisers, and your use of emails, special promotions or newsletters 
we send to you. “Web Beacons” are tiny graphic image files imbedded 
in a web page or email that provide a presence on the web page or email 
and send back to its home server information from the 
user’s browser. The information collected by web beacons allows us 
to statistically monitor how many people are using 
the Website and selected sponsors' and advertisers' sites, or opening 
our emails, and for what purposes. </p>

<h2>7. Storage</h2>

<p>We store all Traffic Data and review 
postings indefinitely, even after “deletion,” and may archive such 
information elsewhere.  We store all Personal Information until 
you request that we modify or delete it, in which case we may still 
wind up retaining some of that information for the reasons described 
in Section 18 below. </p>

<h2>8. Children</h2>
<p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection 
Act (COPPA) severely restricts what information can be collected from 
children under the age of 13. For this reason, children under the age 
of 13 in the United States are prohibited from using the Website.  
The Website is not directed at children, and ZocDoc does not knowingly 
collect any information from individuals under the age of 13.  
If we learn that we have received any information from an individual 
under the age of 13, we will use that information only to respond directly 
to that child (or a parent or guardian) to inform him or her that he 
or she cannot use the Services and subsequently we will delete that 
information from our own servers.</p>

<h2>9. ZocDoc’s Use of Your Information</h2>
<p>We may use 
your Contact Data to send you information about ZocDoc or our products 
or Services, to contact you when necessary, including to remind you 
of upcoming or follow-up appointments, and in conjunction with your 
use of certain Interactive Tools. We may use your Demographic Data, 
your Traffic Data, your Insurance Data or your Medical Data to customize 
and tailor your experience on the Website, in emails and in other communications, 
displaying content that we think you might be interested in and according 
to your preferences. You agree that ZocDoc may use Personal Information 
to allow your doctors to make appointments with other doctors on your 
behalf through the Services. <br></p>

<h2>10. Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>We share certain categories of information 
we collect from you in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. We 
may share Demographic Data with advertisers and other third parties 
only on an aggregate (i.e., non-personally-identifiable) basis. We may 
also share your Contact Data, Demographic Data, Insurance Data and Medical 
Data with Providers you choose to schedule on our Website.  We 
also share Personal Information and Traffic Data with our business partners 
who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, 
fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation 
of the Website and/or by making certain Interactive Tools available 
to our users. Those business partners shall be bound to uphold the same 
standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you 
in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and 
other Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations 
to ZocDoc and to provide your requested medical care and services. Last, 
we may transfer information about you to another company in connection 
with a merger, sale or acquisition by or of ZocDoc.  In this event, 
we will use reasonable efforts to notify you before information about 
you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.  
ZocDoc does not share, sell, rent or trade your Personal Information 
with any third parties for their promotional purposes.</p>

<h2>11. User Choice</h2>

<p>You may choose not to provide us with 
any Personal Information. In such an event, you can still access and 
use much of the Website; however you will not be able to access and 
use those portions of the Website that require your Personal Information. </p>

<h2>12. Confidentiality and Security</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this 
Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will 
not share it with third parties, unless we believe in good faith that 
disclosure of your Personal Information or any other information we 
collect about you is necessary to: (1) comply with a court order or 
other legal process; (2) protect the rights, property or safety of ZocDoc 
or another party; (3) enforce our Terms of Use; or (4) respond to claims 
that any posting or other content violates the rights of third-parties.</p>

<h2>13. Doctors and Dentists</h2>
<p>Doctors, dentists, their employees, and 
their agents should be particularly aware of their obligations of patient 
confidentiality, including without limitation their obligations under 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), 
both in communicating with ZocDoc and in responding to a review of their 
services posted on our Website.  ZocDoc does not have, and will not 
accept, any obligations of confidentiality with respect to any communications 
other than those expressly stated in this Privacy Policy and ZocDoc’s <a href="/public/terms.aspx" style="text-decoration:underline;">
Terms of Use</a>.  </p>

<h2>14. Public Information</h2>
<p>Any information that you may reveal in 
a review posting or other online discussion or forum is intentionally 
open to the public and is not in any way private. You should think carefully 
before disclosing any personally identifiable information in any public 
forum. What you have written may be seen and/or collected by third parties 
and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict.</p>

<h2>15. Security</h2>
<p>The security of your Personal Information 
is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards 
to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission 
and once we receive it.  For example, when you enter sensitive information 
on our Website, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer 
technology (SSL).  </p>
<p>Although we make good faith efforts to 
store Personal Information in a secure operating environment that is 
not open to the public, you should understand that there is no such 
thing as complete security, and we do not guarantee that there will 
be no unintended disclosures of your Personal Information. If we become 
aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner 
not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts 
to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent 
we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted 
by law.</p>

<h2>16. Lost or Stolen Information</h2>
<p>You must promptly notify us if your Contact 
Data is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, 
we will remove that Contact Data from your account and update our records 
accordingly. </p>

<h2>17. Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We reserve the right, at any time, to 
add to, change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy so please review 
it frequently. If we do, then we will notify you here, as well as by 
posting a notice on our Website and/or by e-mailing you, along with 
a description of any changes (material or otherwise) and, where appropriate, 
a link to the modified policy so that you can review it. In all cases, 
use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect 
at the time such information is collected. </p>

<h2>18. Controlling Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>As a registered user of the Website, 
you can modify some of the Personal Information you have included in 
your profile by logging in and accessing your account.  You cannot, 
however, change your username once you have registered.  Upon your 
request, ZocDoc will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete your 
account and the Personal Information in your profile; however, it may 
be impossible to remove your account without some residual information 
being retained by ZocDoc.  Registered users who wish to close their 
account should contact <u><a href="mailto:privacy@zocdoc.com" target="_blank">privacy@zocdoc.com</a></u>.</p>

<h2>19. Links to Other Websites</h2>
<p>The Website contains links to third party 
websites to which ZocDoc has no affiliation.  ZocDoc does not share 
your personal information with those websites and is not responsible 
for their privacy practices.  Some web sites may have the look 
and feel of our Website.  Please be aware that you may be on a different 
site and that this Privacy Policy only covers our Website. <b> </b>
Should you decide to visit one of these third party websites, we suggest 
that you read its privacy policy.</p>

<h2>20.  TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal Program</h2>
<p>ZocDoc is a licensee of the TRUSTe Web 
Privacy Seal Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization 
whose mission is to build users’ trust and confidence in the Internet 
by promoting the use of fair information practices.  Because ZocDoc
