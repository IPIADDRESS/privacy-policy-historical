<h2 class="sg-h2">
1. Introduction
</h2>

<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
ZocDoc, Inc. (“us,” “we,” or “<b>ZocDoc</b>”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our customers, visitors, and other users of ZocDoc.com (the “<b>Site</b>”) and related websites, applications, services and mobile applications provided by ZocDoc and on/in which this Privacy Policy is posted or referenced (collectively, the “<b>Services</b>”). We created this Privacy Policy (“<b>Privacy Policy</b>”) to give you confidence as you use the Services and to demonstrate our commitment to the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website or digital service that you may be able to access through the Services or any website or digital services of ZocDoc’s business partners, each of which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that may materially differ from this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Services is governed by this Privacy Policy and the Agreement (as the term “Agreement” is defined in our <a href="/terms/updated" target="&quot;_blank&quot;">Terms of Use</a>).  Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning in the Agreement.
</p>

<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE PRACTICES AND POLICIES OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU CANNOT USE THE SERVICES. IF YOU USE THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE ELSE (SUCH AS YOUR CHILD) OR AN ENTITY (SUCH AS YOUR EMPLOYER), YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED BY SUCH INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY TO ACCEPT THIS PRIVACY POLICY ON SUCH INDIVIDUAL'S OR ENTITY'S BEHALF.
</p>


<h2 class="sg-h2">
2. Information We Collect
</h2>

<h3 class="sg-h3">
2.1 <u>Personal Information</u>
</h3>

<h4 class="sg-h4">
2.1.1 <u>Personal Information Generally</u>
</h4>
<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
Some of the Services require us to know more about you so that we can best meet your needs. When you access these Services, we may ask you to voluntarily provide us certain information that personally identifies (or could be used to personally identify) you (“<b>Personal Information</b>”). Personal Information includes (but is not limited to) the following categories of information: (1) contact data (such as your e-mail address and phone number); (2) demographic data (such as your gender, your date of birth and your zip code); (3) insurance data (such as your insurance carrier, insurance plan, member ID, group ID and payer ID); (4) medical data (such as the doctors, dentists or other health care providers (“<b>Healthcare Providers</b>”) you have visited, your reasons for visit, your dates of visit, your medical history, and other medical and health information you choose to share with us), and (5) other information that you voluntarily choose to provide to us, including without limitation SSN, unique identifiers such as passwords, and Personal Information in emails or letters that you send to us. You may still access and use some of the Services if you choose not to provide us with any Personal Information, but the features of the Services that require your Personal Information will not be accessible to you.</p>

<h4 class="sg-h4">
2.1.2 <u>Billing, Collection and Payment Information</u>
</h4>
<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
When you make a payment through our Services to a Healthcare Provider (as further described in and subject to other provisions of the Agreement), your payment card information is processed by our payment processing partner, Stripe (<a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank">https://stripe.com</a>).  Stripe collects your voluntarily provided payment card information necessary to process your payment. Stripe’s use and storage of information it collects is governed by Stripe’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy. The information we store includes your payment card type and the last four digits of the payment card. We may provide to you the option to remove your stored payment card information through your account settings page.
</p>

<h3 class="sg-h3">
2.2 <u>Traffic Data</u>
</h3>
<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
We also may automatically collect certain data when you use the Services, such as (1) IP address; (2) domain server; (3) type of device(s) used to access the Services; (4) web browser(s) used to access the Services; (5) referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Services; (6) geolocation information; and (7) other statistics and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Services (collectively “<b>Traffic Data</b>”). Depending on applicable law, some Traffic Data may be Personal Information.
</p>
<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
We may also collect additional information, which may be Personal Information, as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.
</p>

<h3 class="sg-h3">
2.3 <u>HIPAA and PHI</u>
</h3>
<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
Under a federal law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“<b>HIPAA</b>”), some of the demographic, health and/or health-related information that ZocDoc collects as part of providing the Services may be considered “protected health information” or “<b>PHI</b>”. Specifically, when ZocDoc receives identifiable information about you from or on behalf of your Healthcare Providers, this information is PHI. HIPAA provides specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and restricts how PHI is used and disclosed. ZocDoc may only use and disclose your PHI in the ways permitted by your Healthcare Provider(s). In addition, you have been or will be asked to e-sign the ZocDoc User Authorization (the “<b>ZocDoc Authorization</b>”). Your decision to e-sign the ZocDoc Authorization is entirely voluntary. If you choose to e-sign the ZocDoc Authorization, you agree that ZocDoc may use and disclose your PHI in the same way it uses and discloses your Personal Information that is not PHI. These uses and disclosures are described in this Privacy Policy. To the extent any provision in the ZocDoc Authorization is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or other provisions of the Agreement, then the provision in the ZocDoc Authorization only controls with respect to your PHI. If you do not e-sign the ZocDoc Authorization, then your Personal Information that is not PHI is governed by this Privacy Policy and your Personal Information that is PHI is used and disclosed only as permitted by your Healthcare Provider(s).
</p>


<h2 class="sg-h2">
3. How We Collect Information
</h2>

<p class="sg-p">
We collect information (including Personal Information and Traffic Data) when you use and interact with the Services, and in some cases from third party sources.  Such information includes:
</p>
<ul class="sg-bullet-list">
<li class="sg-p">
When you use the Services’ interactive tools and services, such as searching for Healthcare Providers, searching for available appointments with Healthcare Providers and completing medical history forms ("<b>Medical History Forms</b>") prior to Healthcare Provider appointments;</li>
<li class="sg-p">
When you voluntarily provide information in free-form text boxes through the Services and through responses to surveys, questionnaires and the like;
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
If you download and install certain applications and software we make available, we may receive and collect information transmitted from your computing device for the purpose of providing you the relevant Services, such as information that lets ZocDoc know when you are logged on and available to receive update or alert notices;
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
If you download our mobile application, we may receive information about your location and mobile device;
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
Through cookies, web beacons, website analytics services and other tracking technology (collectively, “<b>Tracking Tools</b>”), as described below; and
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
When you use the “Contact Us” function on the Site, send us an email or otherwise contact us.
</li>   
</ul>


<h2 class="sg-h2">
4. Tracking Tools and “Do Not Track”
</h2>

<h3 class="sg-h3">
4.1. <u>Tracking Tools</u>
</h3>
<p class="sg-p">
We may use tools outlined below in order to better understand users.
</p>
<ul class="sg-bullet-list">
<li class="sg-p">
<b>Cookies:</b>
“Cookies” are small computer files transferred to your computing device that contain information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited and activities conducted while using the Services. We use Cookies to help us improve or tailor the Services by tracking your navigation habits, storing your authentication status so you do not have to re-enter your credentials each time you use the Services, customizing your experience with the Services and for analytics and fraud prevention.
<br><br>
We may use a type of advertising commonly known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising. This means that some of our business partners use Cookies to display ZocDoc ads on other websites and services based on information about your use of the Services and on your interests (as inferred from your online activity). Other Cookies used by our business partners may collect information when you use the Services, such as the IP address, mobile device ID, operating system, browser, web page interactions, the geographic location of your internet service provider and demographic information, such as gender and age range. These Cookies help ZocDoc learn more about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors.
<br><br>
For more information on cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
<b>Web Beacons:</b>
“Web Beacons” (a.k.a. clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or email that may be used to collect anonymous information about your use of our Services, the websites of selected advertisers and the emails, special promotions or newsletters that we send you. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Services, using the selected advertisers' websites or opening our emails, and for what purpose, and also allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising.
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
<b>Website Analytics:</b>
We may use third-party website analytics services in connection with the Services, including, for example, to register mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity and text that you type into the Site. These website analytics services generally do not collect Personal Information unless you voluntarily provide it and generally do not track your browsing habits across websites which do not use their services. We use the information collected from these services to help make the Services easier to use and as otherwise set forth in Section 6 (Use of Information).
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
<b>Mobile Device Identifiers:</b>
Mobile device identifiers are data stored on your mobile device that may track mobile device and data and activities occurring on and through it, as well as the applications installed on it. Mobile device identifiers enable collection of Personal Information (such as media access control, address and location) and Traffic Data. As with other Tracking Tools, mobile device identifiers help ZocDoc learn more about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors.
</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="sg-h3">
4.2. <u>Options for Opting out of Cookies and Mobile Device Identifiers</u>
</h3>
<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
Some web browsers (including some mobile web browsers) allow you to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your computer, tablet or mobile device. You may be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. Although you are not required to accept ZocDoc’s Cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through the Services.
</p>
<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
You may opt out of receiving certain Cookies and certain trackers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">opt out page</a> or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed" target="_blank">consumer opt-out page</a>. When you use these opt-out features, an “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your computer or tablet indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertising from NAI or DAA member companies. If you delete Cookies on your computer or tablet, you may need to opt out again. For information about how to opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile device identifiers, please visit  <a href="http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device" target="_blank">http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device</a>. Please note that even after opting out of interest-based advertising, you may still see ZocDoc’s advertisements that are not interest-based (i.e., not targeted toward you). Also, opting out does not mean that ZocDoc is no longer using Tracking Tools -- ZocDoc still may collect information about your use of the Services even after you have opted out of interest-based advertisements and may still serve advertisements to you via the Services based on information it collects via the Services.
</p>


<h3 class="sg-h3">
4.3. <u>How ZocDoc Responds to Browser “Do Not Track” Signals</u>
</h3>
<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website operator elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the website operator may refrain from collecting certain Personal Information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website operators, including ZocDoc, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank">http://allaboutdnt.com</a>.
</p>


<h2 class="sg-h2">
5. Use of Information

<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
We may use information that is neither Personal Information nor PHI (including non-PHI Personal Information that has been de-identified and/or aggregated) to better understand who uses ZocDoc and how we can deliver a better healthcare experience (for example, testing different kinds of emails has helped us understand when and how patients prefer to get Wellness Reminders for preventive care), or otherwise at our discretion.
</p>


<h2 class="sg-h2">
6. Disclosure of Information
</h2>

<p class="sg-p">
We may disclose certain information that we collect from you:
</p>
<ul class="sg-bullet-list">
<li class="sg-p">
We may share your Personal Information with Healthcare Providers with which you choose to schedule through the Services. For example, if you complete a Medical History Form using the Services in advance of an appointment, we may share your Medical History Form with your Healthcare Providers. You also may choose to store but not share your Medical History Form.
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
We may share your Personal Information with your Healthcare Providers to enable them to refer you to and make appointments with other Healthcare Providers on your behalf or to perform analyses on potential health issues or treatments, provided that you choose to use the applicable Services.
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
We may share your Personal Information with Healthcare Providers in the event of an emergency.
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
We may also share your Personal Information with organizations that collect, aggregate and organize your information so they can make it more easily accessible to your Healthcare Providers.
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
We do not sell email addresses to third parties. We may share your email address with our business partners to enable them to help ZocDoc customize our advertising.
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
We may share your Personal Information and Traffic Data with our business partners who perform core operational services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, data storage, security, insurance verification, or Website analytics set forth in Section 4.1 (Tracking Tools)) and/or by making certain features available to our users.
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
For the purposes of determining eligibility and cost-sharing obligations, and otherwise obtaining benefit plan information, we may share with the insurance provider you identify to us (via our business partners) your insurance-related Personal Information.
</li>
<li class="sg-p">
We may transfer your information to another company in connection with a merger, sale, acquisition or other change of ownership or control by or of ZocDoc (whether in whole or in part). Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to different privacy and security policies and practices.
</li>
</ul>

<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
We also may need to disclose your Personal Information or any other information we collect about you if we determine in good faith that such disclosure is needed to: (1) comply with applicable law, regulation, court order or other legal process; (2) protect the rights, property or safety of ZocDoc or another party; (3) enforce the Agreement or other agreements with you; or (4) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates third-party rights.
</p>
<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
We may disclose information that is neither Personal Information nor PHI (including non-PHI Personal Information that has been de-identified and/or aggregated) at our discretion.
</p>
<p class="sg-p sg-p-section">
We store and process your information on our servers in the United States and abroad. We maintain industry standard backup and archival systems.
