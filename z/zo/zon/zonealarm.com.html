      <p class="headblack2"><a name="2"></a>What Information We Gather/Track</p>
      <p>You may decide whether to proceed with any activity that requests personally identifiable information. If you do not wish to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the transaction. We do not collect information from individuals under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, we ask that you do not submit any personal information through the Site. If we have specific knowledge that an individual under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information to the Site, we will delete such information permanently and without notice. </p>
      <p>Except as described below, Zone Labs will only disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties if acting under a good faith belief that such action is necessary (1) to conform to legal requirements; (2) to protect and defend the rights or property of Zone Labs; (3) to enforce the Zone Labs Terms of Service; or (4) in the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all Zone Labs' assets relating to the business in connection with which the information was collected. Zone Labs collects personally identifiable information that can be divided into the following categories: </p>
      <blockquote><p><b class="headblack2">Zone Labs Product Registration Information</b>: Some Zone Labs products  ask you for certain personally identifiable information as part of the  installation/registration process (including but not limited to your  name, email address, credit card information and connection type and  number of computers). Certain of this information is necessary in order  to conclude the transaction, and for applicable products, to be eligible  to receive technical support. If you provide us with personally identifiable  information, and select the "Inform me about important updates  and news" option on the purchase confirmation page or in the in  the "Registration Information" section located in the "Configuration Panel" of the "Control Panel" in the Zone Labs product, we use this information to send you communications, including informative emails/newsletters about Zone Labs product upgrades, product updates, new products, and services, and to provide you with special offers that may be of interest to you, including paid advertisements from third parties. In the event you no longer wish  to receive such information, you may choose to opt out of receiving  further communications by complying with the procedures listed in the "<a href="#8">Updating/Unsubscribing Your Email Address</a>" section of this Privacy Policy. Except in the case of Partner Products (see below), Zone Labs keeps personally identifiable information collected in the course of installation/registration of Zone Labs' products confidential and does not sell, trade, or exchange mailing lists with any organization. </p>
	  <p><b class="headblack2">Partner Product Purchases</b>: Some products offered via the Site are third-party products ("Partner Products") offered by Zone Labs' partners ("Zone Labs Partners"). If  you purchase Partner Products from this Site, Zone Labs will ask you  to provide personally identifiable information as part of the installation/registration  process (including but not limited to your name, email address and credit  card information). You are required to provide this information in order  to conclude the transaction.  Zone Labs provides this information, except  credit card information, to the applicable Zone Labs Partner to enable  the applicable Partner to register your purchase and verify support  eligibility. Zone Labs will require the applicable Zone Labs Partner  to use your information only to verify support eligibility and, in the  case of certain Partner Products, to provide  you required updates. Zone Labs will not share this information with  any other third party.</p>
	  <p><b>Co-branded Pages</b>: Zone Labs provides commerce functionality for selected partner companies who wish to offer Zone Labs products to their customers and/or users. If you come to the Site by accessing a link provided by a partner company, you will be informed that your information (not including credit card) will be shared with the partner company. You will have the option to "opt-out" of promotional communications from both Zone Labs and the partner company when you register your product. </p>
	  <p><b class="headblack2">Credit Card Information</b>: If you use a credit card to purchase  products via this Site, your name as it appears on the credit card,  the credit card number, expiration date and billing address will be  encrypted as it passes over the Internet. Zone Labs does not record  or keep your credit card information for online credit-card transactions;  rather such information is simply passed through to our contracted payment processing vendor. Zone Labs may access such information through the payment processing company, but does not do so except to process refunds or adjustments and to the extent necessary in the event of nonpayment or disputed payments, or as may be necessary for Zone Labs' compliance, in Zone Labs' discretion, with applicable law.</p>
	  <p><b class="headblack2">Technical Support</b>: If you request technical support online,  we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction  such as your name, email address and information about your computer  hardware, software, and the nature of the problem you are experiencing. In the course of providing support, your data may be transmitted to service providers that are under contract to Zone Labs and have agreed to abide by the provisions of this privacy policy. Such transmissions of your data are encrypted and secure.</p>
	  <p><b class="headblack2">Volume Sales Form</b>: If you request volume licensing information online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction such as company name, email address, needs assessment and your organization's primary business activity.</p>	  
	  <p><b class="headblack2">Partner Application</b>: If you request participation in the partner program online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction such as company name, email address, and company profile.</p>

	  <p><b class="headblack2">Loss of Internet Connectivity During Use of Zone Labs Products</b>: If you have installed certain Zone Labs products, in very rare instances you may lose connectivity to the Internet due to an error on your computer  or a hacker threat. In this rare event, you will receive instructions  from Zone Labs on how to regain connectivity to the Internet. You will  be given the opportunity to submit an error report to Zone Labs for  diagnostic purposes only. Your decision to submit an error report to  Zone Labs is purely voluntary. If you do submit such an error report,  Zone Labs will copy error logs from your computer for error diagnosis.  Any personally identifiable information contained in such error logs  is purely incidental, will not be otherwise used by Zone Labs or  shared with any third parties,  and will be permanently deleted from our systems upon completion of our analysis.</p>	
	  <p><b class="headblack2">Surveys</b>: Zone Labs periodically requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Zone Labs uses both in-house and third-party Web-Based Interviewing Systems to compile the surveys. Information requested in the surveys may include broad demographic information (such as zip code, age level) for aggregate use and does not identify the user. No cookies are used. Survey information is not sold, shared, or rented to any third party, and is used internally solely by Zone Labs for purposes of improving the use and satisfaction of this Site, Services, and our products.</p></blockquote>
	  <p><b class="headblack2">Affiliates</b><br>When a user or a company signs up to be a marketing program affiliate, they do so through a third-party provider of affiliate marketing programs. Such third-party provider does share personally identifiable information about affiliates with Zone Labs. This information is not sold, shared, or rented to any third party, and is used internally only to manage and maintain relationships with affiliates. The Zone Labs privacy policy governs the information that is collected on <a href="https://sshop.element5.com/esales/affiliates/signup.html?publisherid=50319&amp;md5=72bf9e758cd478830cbadf920601db92&amp;languageid=1" target="_blank">Element5</a> and this information will be used in accordance with the Zone Labs privacy policy.</p>
