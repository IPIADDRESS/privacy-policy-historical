<h1 style="margin-bottom:12px">Zong Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
This policy applies to your use of the Zong service and tells you how we use and protect the
information we may collect. If you reside in the United States of America, the contracting
party is PayPal, Inc., eBay Park North, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, California 95131,
USA. If you reside within the European Union, the Zong service is provided to you by PayPal
(Europe) S.Ã  r.l. &amp; Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg. If you reside in
any other country the contracting party is PayPal Pte. Ltd, a company incorporated in
Singapore whose address is 5 Temasek Boulevard #09-01, Suntec Tower Five, Singapore
038985.
</p>


<h3>Binding Corporate Rules</h3>
<p>
In addition to the privacy practices set out in this Privacy Policy, eBay Inc., the ultimate
parent company of PayPal, has established a set of Corporate Rules (also referred to as
Binding Corporate Rules), approved by a number of European Union data protection
regulators. These Corporate Rules are a commitment by eBay Inc. to adequately protect your
personal information regardless of where the data resides, and depending upon your location,
may provide additional rights through your data protection regulator or a court. If you would
like additional information regarding our Corporate Rules please contact us at privacy@zong.com.

</p>


<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>
Using ZONG services will require publishers, developers or end-users of ZONG Web
Payment Service (ZWPS) to provide ZONG certain personal information so that ZONG can
provide you with the best service possible.

</p>



<h4>For publishers or developers</h4>
<p>
In order to integrate the ZONG service well on your Web sites, ZONG may request you to provide their phone numbers, names, instant messaging details, countries, addresses, valid e-mails, and in order to pay, your banking details.
</p>

<h4>For end-users</h4>
<p>
To ensure the good performance and proper functionality of the ZONG service, ZONG may
use your personal information (mainly phone number, email, wireless network or financial
information) to process and monitor the payment, billing and if needed, communication and
support. We will also use the information to market PayPal services to you. You will be able
to unsubscribe from any such mailings.
</p>

<h3>Use of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>
ZONG may use your personal data (mainly phone numbers and email) for communication,
support and invoicing purposes.
</p>

<h4>For publishers or developers</h4>
<p>
In order to integrate the ZONG service on your Web sites, ZONG may use your personal information
(mainly phone number and email) for communication, support and invoicing purposes.
</p>

<h4>For end-users</h4>
<p>
To ensure the good performance and proper functionality of the ZONG service, ZONG may
use your personal information (mainly phone number, email, wireless network or financial
information) to process and monitor the payment, billing and if needed, communication and
support. We will also use the information to market PayPal services to you. You will be able
to unsubscribe from any such mailings.
</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>
To access the Developer Network on the Web site or ZONG services, ZONG may request certain personal information.
</p>

<h4>For publishers or developers</h4>
<p>
To access the Developer Network, we require you to create a user name and password. On
the registration form, ZONG may request certain personally identifiable information from
you. During registration, you are required to give contact information (such as name and
email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which
you have expressed interest.
</p>

<h4>For end-users</h4>
<p>
There is no need for you to register phone numbers for our payment service as these numbers
are already pre-registered with the mobile network operators. When you choose to make a
payment, you insert your phone number on the payment console and ZONG may send you a
payment confirmation via the wireless network you have subscribed to.
</p>

<h3> Service-related Announcements</h3>
<p>

We will send developers and publishers strictly service-related announcements on rare
occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended
for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these
communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them,
you have the option to deactivate your account.
</p>

<h3>Newsletters</h3>
<p>
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.
Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.  Please see the âChoice and Opt-outâ section.


</p>

<h3> Agents/Service Providers   </h3>
<p>
We use other third parties such as an email service provider to send out emails
on our behalf and an online survey provider to conduct anonymous surveys on our site.
When you sign up for our newsletter or participate in our surveys, we will share your
email as necessary for the third party to provide that service.  These third parties are prohibited
from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.
</p>

<h3> Customer Service </h3>
<p>
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a
welcoming email to verify your username and password.  We will also communicate with you
in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.
We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.
</p>

<h3> Wireless Network Providers and Messaging Systems</h3>

<p>
We use wireless networks to process your payments so that you see charges on your monthly
phone bill. When you choose to make a payment, you insert your phone number on the
payment console and ZONG may send you a payment confirmation via the wireless network
you have subscribed to. ZONG may inform the wireless network providers of their respective
subscribers who made payments through the console so as to include charges on their bills.
</p>

<p>
As part of our payment flow, end-users of the payment console will receive text messages
containing your Personal Identification Number (PIN), payment confirmation, etc. via Short
Message Service (SMS). If you purchase applications, wallpapers or ringtones, you will
receive your mobile content via Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS). The phone numbers
are being stored in ZONG to monitor your payment status mainly for customer support. As
explained earlier, the Personal Information you provided us will not be shared, sold, rented,
or traded to any third party except as described in this privacy policy without your prior
consent.
</p>

<h3>Blog/Testimonials</h3>
<p>
If you use a blog or testimonial on this site, you should be aware that any personally
identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of
these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. For testimonials, we do
obtain the customer's consent prior to posting their name and video testimonial. We are not
responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
If you want to remove your personal information that is being displayed on our Web site
under public pages, please contact us at privacy@zong.com.
</p>

<h3>Add This</h3>
<p>
When you use "Add This" to bookmark and share our products and site, you will be taken to
a third party site. Please note that these third party sitesâ privacy policies govern the collection
and use of the information collected on those sites.
</p>

<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>
This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by ZONG. Please be aware that we, ZONG, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.
</p>

<h3>General and Access</h3>
<p>
ZONG may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process,
for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such
information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe
it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use,
to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing ZONG Web site and applicable laws or as
otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements.
</p>

<h3>Disclosing</h3>
<p>
ZONG reserves the right to access and disclose your Personal Information to comply with
laws, subpoena and lawful government requests, to operate its systems properly, to protect
other ZONG users or third parties. ZONG may also reserve the right to disclose individually
identifiable information to third parties where a complaint arises concerning your use of the
ZONG service, and that use is deemed inconsistent with the ZONG Terms &amp; Conditions.
</p>

<p>

Now and in the future, there are subsidiaries, joint ventures, and one or more parent
companies whom we control, who control us, or with whom we are under common control
(collectively, âAffiliatesâ). We may share some or all of your personal information with these
Affiliates for their business purposes and as required or permitted by law. If our company or
our assets are acquired by another company, or otherwise during the dissolution or sale of the
company or its assets, we may also provide you data to our corporate purchaser, successor, or
new Affiliates.

</p>

<h3>Information Protection</h3>
<p>
ZONG protect Personal Information received by establishing appropriate physical, electronic
and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. This helps prevent
unauthorized access, maintains data accuracy and ensures that the information is used
correctly.
</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive
information such as credit card or banking information on our registration or order forms, we
encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally
accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us,
both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet,
or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use
commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its
absolute security.

</p>

<h3>Cookies </h3>
<p>
A cookie is a piece of information that is deposited by the ZONG computer server when you
visit ZONG Web site which is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser. On
revisiting ZONG Web site, the ZONG' server will recognize the cookies, giving ZONG
information about your last visit. At your option, we link the information we store in cookies
to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site so as to enhance your
experience. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to
make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your
browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You
can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browserâs
âhelpâ file.
</p>

<p>
We set a persistent cookie to store your mobile numbers which allows our application to prefill
your mobile number so that you do not have to enter it in future sessions. Persistent
cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience
on our site. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can alter the settings
of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance.

</p>

<p>
We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable
information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. These services track traffic volume and
site statistics that are not linked to personally identifiable information. The use of cookies by
our tracking utility company and other trusted partners is not covered by our privacy
statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

</p>


<h3>IP Addresses </h3>
<p>
Every time you connect to ZONG's Web site, web server logs will be stored which show your
IP address (the unique number which your machine uses when it is connected to the Internet);
what you looked at; whether the page request was successful or not, and which browser you
used to view the pages. The use of this data is strictly for statistical purposes and
personalization purposes only. This helps ZONG understand where you come from, which
areas of the site are of particular interest and also which pages are not being requested. We
link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are
tied to personally identifiable information to help combat fraud, improve security and provide
localized content and instructions in the language native to that country.
</p>



<h3>Choice and Opt-out</h3>
<p>
We will not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information in ways incompatible with the
ones described above without providing you a choice. We provide you the opportunity to
âopt-outâ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when
we ask for this information. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional
communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in
each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at privacy@zong.com.

</p>

<h3>Use by Children </h3>
<p>
We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the
age of 13, without the consent of a parent or guardian.
</p>

corrected, updated, amended, deleted or deactivated by sending an email to us at
privacy@zong.com. For verification purposes please include your first name, last name and

information by logging into their account. We will respond to your request to access within
48 hours.
</p>

<h3>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h3>
<p>
If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those changes to this privacy
statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of
what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we
disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please
review it frequently. If we change how we use your personally identifiable information, we
will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
