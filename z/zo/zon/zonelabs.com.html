            product upgrades, product updates, new products, and services. These communications provide you with special
            offers that may be of interest to you, and may include paid advertisements from third parties. ZoneAlarm
            uses a

        <p><b>Special Offers</b><br>
            ZoneAlarm has relationships with business partners that provide a number of third-party products and

        <p><b>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</b><br>Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology

            us
            what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to
            cookies,
            and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a
            user’s
            computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at
            the

            analyze trends and the results of our marketing efforts, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to
            administer the Site and Services, and analyze users’ movements. We may periodically share aggregate

        <h2 id="information">Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>All information gathered on the Site is stored and maintained in secure facilities. In addition, internal

            aggregate data in the interest of improving our Services and products.</p>
        <p>No personally identifiable information is gathered during interactions with ZoneAlarm Services. We may
            aggregate

        <h2 id="personal-data">International Transfers of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>ZoneAlarm is a global business. Our customers and our operations are spread around the world. As a result we
            collect and transfer Personal Data on a global basis. That means that we may transfer your Personal Data to
            locations outside of your country.</p>
        <p>Where we transfer your Personal Data to another country outside the EEA, we will ensure that it is protected
            and
            transferred in a manner consistent with legal requirements. In relation to data being transferred outside of
            Europe, for example, this may be done in one of the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The country that we send the data to might be approved by the European Commission as offering an
                adequate
                level of protection for Personal Data (Israel is an approved country);
            </li>
            <li>The recipient might have signed up to a contract based on “model contractual clauses” approved by the
                European
                Commission, obliging them to protect your Personal Data;
            </li>
            <li>Where the recipient is located in the US, it might be a certified member of the EU-US Privacy Shield
                scheme;
                or
            </li>
            <li>In other circumstances the law may permit us to otherwise transfer your Personal Data outside Europe.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can obtain more details of the protection given to your Personal Data when it is transferred outside
            Europe
            (including a copy of the standard data protection clauses which we have entered into with recipients of your
            Personal Data) by contacting us as described in the section titled “Questions and Concerns” below.</p>
        <p><b>How We Safeguard Your Information</b><br>We have extensive controls in place to maintain the security of
            our
            information and information systems. Client files are protected with safeguards according to the sensitivity
            of
            the relevant information. Appropriate controls (such as restricted access) are placed on our computer
            systems.
            Physical access to areas where Personal Data is gathered, processed or stored is limited to authorised
            employees.
        </p>
        <p>As a condition of employment, ZoneAlarm employees are required to follow all applicable laws and regulations,
            including in relation to data protection law. Access to sensitive Personal Data is limited to those
            employees who
            need to it to perform their roles. Unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential client information by a
            ZoneAlarm employee is prohibited and may result in disciplinary measures.</p>
        <p>When you contact a ZoneAlarm employee about your file, you may be asked for some Personal Data. This type of
            safeguard is designed to ensure that only you, or someone authorised by you, has access to your file.</p>
        <p><b>How Long We Keep Your Personal Data</b><br>How long we will hold your Personal Data for will vary and will
            be
            determined by the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The purpose for which we are using it – ZoneAlarm will need to keep the data for as long as is necessary
                for
                that purpose; and
            </li>
            <li>Legal obligations – laws or regulation may set a minimum period for which we have to keep your Personal
                Data.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Your Rights</b><br>In all the above cases in which we collect, use or store your Personal Data, you may
            have
            the following rights and, in most cases, you can exercise them free of charge. These rights include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the right to obtain information regarding the processing of your Personal Data and access to the
                Personal Data
                which we hold about you;
            </li>
            <li>the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your Personal Data at any time. Please note,
                however,
                that we may still be entitled to process your Personal Data if we have another legitimate reason for
                doing so.
                For example, we may need to retain Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation;
            </li>
            <li>in some circumstances, the right to receive some Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and
                machine-readable format and/or request that we transmit those data to a third party where this is
                technically
                feasible. Please note that this right only applies to Personal Data which you have provided directly to
                ZoneAlarm;
            </li>
            <li>the right to request that we rectify your Personal Data if it is inaccurate or incomplete;</li>
            <li>the right to request that we erase your Personal Data in certain circumstances. Please note that there
                may be
                circumstances where you ask us to erase your Personal Data but we are legally entitled to retain it;
            </li>
            <li>the right to request that we restrict our processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances.
                Again,
                there may be circumstances where you ask us to restrict our processing of your Personal Data but we are
                legally
                entitled to refuse that request; and
            </li>
            <li>the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection regulator if you think that any of your
                rights have been infringed by us.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can exercise your rights by contacting us using the details listed in the section titled “Questions and
            Concerns” below.</p>
