      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#3F466C">zTelligence is 
        committed to its policy of protecting the privacy and confidential information 
        of Members, who register to build and deploy surveys and who from time 
        to time might purchase services offered by zTelligence, and Panelists, 
        who register to respond to and answer surveys.<br>
        <br>
        <b>What personally identifiable information does zTelligence collect and 
        what does zTelligence do with it?</b><br>
        <br>
        Upon registration, Members provide us with personal information such as 
        their name, address and email address. We use this information to establish 
        individual accounts and lockers, protected by a password the Member selects. 
        We ask for some additional demographic information from our Panelists 
        to determine their eligibility to participate in surveys requiring Panelists 
        who meet a specific demographic profile.<br>
        <br>
        With respect to both Members and Panelists, zTelligence uses the email 
        address supplied in the registration process to confirm registration, 
        and to send notices and updates to you concerning the services and the 
        site. We will also add you to zTelligence's mailing list if you requested 
        that during registration.<br>
        <br>
        zTelligence also uses "cookies," or small pieces of information that we 
        store on users' computers, to recognize returning users and to monitor 
        traffic through the site. This information helps us to make the site better 
        and more user-friendly. We use either cookies or weblogs to collect users IP 
		addresses and log-in times that are identified by individual user.  Finally, 
		we collect the surveys and survey results that you have either deployed or 
		participated in.<br>
        <br>
        NOTE TO PARENTS AND MINORS: We do not want to collect any personal information 
        whatsoever of minors-in fact, we ask that minors do not submit any information 
        about themselves and that they not use this Site. Anyone using this Site 
        or the Services warrants and promises that they are 18 years of age or 
        older.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Does zTelligence Disclose My Personally Identifiable Information to 
        Other Members?</b><br>
        <br>
        No. All zTelligence does is send surveys to Panelists on behalf of Members. 
        zTelligence sends these surveys without disclosing any personally identifiable 
        information on its Panelists. Demographic information on Panelists that 
        a Member may require is disclosed only in aggregate form.<br>
        <br>
        Panelists should be aware, however, that in responding to surveys or survey 
        invitations that they may be disclosing their own personally identifiable 
        information to Members. The security and privacy protections in place 
        on this Site and through the Service do not cover this type of transfer 
        or disclosure of personal information. Panelists responding to surveys 
        or survey invitations are solely responsible for the content of their 
        responses.<br>
        <br>
        <b>To Whom Do We Disclose Personal Information?</b><br>
        <br>
        As a rule, we will not sell, distribute, publish or otherwise disclose 
        your personally identifying information without your express permission 
        through an email authorization. However, if we believe you have breached 
        the Terms of Agreement, especially with regard to transmitting, publishing 
        or distributing pornographic, obscene, offensive, threatening, harassing, 
        libelous, hate-oriented, harmful, defamatory, racist, illegal or otherwise 
        objectionable materials or content, we will report such conduct to the 
        appropriate authorities and turn over any and all information, including 
        personal identifying information, to appropriate persons or entities. 
        We will also comply with any laws or legal process that may require disclosure 
        of personal identifying information.<br>
        <br>
        <b>How does zTelligence store my Personally Identifiable Information?</b><br>
        <br>
        zTelligence stores personal information of Members and Panelists in secure 
        databases protected by passwords as well as database and network firewalls 
        to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information. While 
        no security systems are infallible, MarketTools (zTelligence's parent 
        company) will prosecute any unauthorized access to secured information 
        to the fullest extent of the law. zTelligence periodically reviews and 
        updates security measures to insure the best possible protections for 
        the membership.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Can I Delete Personally Identifiable Information on the site?</b><br>
        <br>
        You can notify us at any time to remove your registration information 
        from our database by emailing us at support@markettools.com. If you do 
        that, we will not keep any personally identifiable records concerning 
        you unless required to do so by law. However, if you make this request 
        you will be unable to access or use the account you previously created 
        and its associated content without going through the registration process 
        again. In addition, zTelligence cannot retrieve any personally identifiable 
        information Panelists may have disclosed to Members in responding to surveys.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Does zTelligence Collect or Disclose Information (email addresses, 
        names) That I Supply in Order to Send Surveys?</b><br>
        <br>
        No. When you enter email information for your survey recipients or establish 
        email lists in your personal Email List Manager, that information remains 
        untouched and private in your personal locker. Your password protects 
        that information. zTelligence never discloses that information and if 
        it ever wanted to, zTelligence would get express approval from you first. 
        However, if you have breached the Terms of Agreement, zTelligence will 
        report such conduct to the appropriate authorities and turn over any and 
        all information, including personally identifying information, to appropriate 
        persons or entities.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br>
        <br>
        If zTelligence wishes to change this policy, it will publish changes on 
        this Web site before those changes will take effect. zTelligence will 
        also notify users of changes to this policy via electronic mail. As always, 
        if you do not agree with zTelligence's privacy policy, you have the option 
        of requesting that we delete your personally identifiable information 
        from the site. For more information policies, see our terms of agreement.</font><font class="text-home"><br>
