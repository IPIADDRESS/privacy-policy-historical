            </h3>
            <p>
               We and our third party advertising partners may also employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users of our Website. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
               We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients open. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
