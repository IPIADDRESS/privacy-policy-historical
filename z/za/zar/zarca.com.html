              on the site, you are notified of privacy practices that are different 
              from those described in this Privacy Statement, those alternative 
              disclosures will govern that submission.</span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="centretext">There may be situations 
              where Zarca collects data through a survey or similar process when 
              the page does not link to this Statement. In those cases, unless 
              you are informed otherwise, you should assume that Zarca treats 
              all information from such pages as it treats its other valuable 
              business records.</span></p>
            <p><span class="centretext">Of course, there are many other ways in 
              which Zarca could get information from or about you that are not 
              described elsewhere in this Statement. For example, you might send 
              email through a customer service email address, or Zarca may get 
              a complaint about you from a third party. Zarca's practices with 
              respect to such information are pretty much as you'd expect-Zarca 
              uses and discloses this information in a commercially reasonable 
              business manner.</span></p>

              </span><br>
              <span class="centretext"> Zarca may use contractors to help with 
              its operations. Some or all of these contractors may access some 
              parts of the registration database-- user information. Usually these 
              contractors will enter into an agreement that places restrictive 
              provisions on their use and disclosure of all information they obtain 
              through the relationship.</span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="centretext">Zarca may also use third 
              party service providers to help with certain aspects of its operations 
              that may require disclosure of your personal information to them. 
              For example, Zarca may use a third party service provider to mail 
              newsletter, send out email invitations to participate in surveys, 
              serve ads, or deliver some or all of the emails sent as part of 
              the site's normal operation. Again, usually Zarca will place extensive 
              restrictions on the ability of these third parties to use and disclose 
              your personal information except as necessary to perform the services 
              they are asked to perform.</span></p>

              Statement. In addition, as part of a diligence review, Zarca may 
              disclose some or all of your personal information to a potential 
              acquirer or merger partner, although in this case Zarca would try 
              to restrict their use and disclosure of this information.</span></p>

              the disclosure of information about you, and of course Zarca will 
              need to comply. However, irrespective of those situations, Zarca 
              can unilaterally turn over information about you to the government 
              if it believes such disclosure to be appropriate, in which case 
              you authorize it to do so. You also consent to Zarca disclosing 
              information about you to actual or potential parties to a lawsuit 
              that Zarca is or may become involved in (a) if it are required to 
              do so, (b) if it reasonably believes that such disclosures will 
              potentially mitigate its liability, or (c) to enforce its rights.</span></p>

              <span class="centretext">A site and service as complicated as Zarca 
              is never perfect, and thus Zarca may inadvertently make uses or 
              disclosures of your information in ways not contemplated by, or 
              in direct contravention of, this Statement. For example, if the 
              software has a temporary glitch, your personal information could 
              be displayed on the site even though you've configured your preferences 
              otherwise. Zarca might also make ad hoc uses of your information 
              in ways it can't contemplate here. Zarca will do its best to work 
              with you if these types of situations arise, but your sole remedy 
              in these cases is to have Zarca try to rectify the problem as soon 
              as it can.</span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="centretext">In addition, although 
              highly unlikely, it is possible for Internet transmissions containing 
              your personal information to be intercepted by others. It is impossible 
              for Zarca to ensure the privacy and security of all transmissions 
              made to and from the site while in transit.</span></p>
            <p><span class="centretext">Of course, Zarca does not control the 
              privacy practices of its advertisers and other third-party sites 
              that it promotes or links to. If you click through a banner ad or 
              link and submit your information to an advertiser, you will be subject 
              to their privacy policies. Please make sure you understand these 
              policies before submitting your information.</span></p>

              Zarca uses advance industry-standard methods of securing its databases 
              of user information, such as, if and where appropriate, firewalls, 
              security-logs and limits on who can access user information databases. 
              However, please keep in mind that there is no such thing as perfect 
              security on the Internet.</span>
