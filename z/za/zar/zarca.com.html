                        <p align="justify"><br>
                          Zarca is an application service provider that provides 
                          you, our customer, tools to conduct two-way communications 
                          with your customers, employees, suppliers and constituents. 
                          Like the postal service, we understand that the Information 
                          we deliver belongs to you and your survey participants, 
                          not us. At Zarca, it is a core business principle that 
                          we must protect the privacy of our customers and survey 
                          participants or we will not have either. With this principle 
                          in mind, Zarca created this privacy policy to demonstrate 
                          our commitment to your privacy. <br>
                          <br>
                          You should be assured that our practices stated in this 
                          policy are practiced worldwide. Zarca is a global organization, 
                          with legal entities, business processes, management 
                          structures, and technical systems that cross borders. 
                          We may share information between Zarca entities and 
                          transfer it to offices and data centers around the world. 
                          Some countries may provide less legal protection for 
                          personal information than the country in which the information 
                          was provided. No matter the country standards, we will 
                          still handle the information in the manner we describe 
                          here.<br>
                          <br>
                          This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected

                          (the "Site"). It does not speak about Zarca

                                Customers also provide us with Information regarding 
                                the Services you have ordered (e.g., the number

                                want a private or public survey). In addition

                                You provide us with the email address, and sometimes 
                                the name, of each Participant. Before receiving 
                                such Information, we contractually require that 
                                you warranty that you have a pre-existing relationship 
                                with the Survey Participant and/or the Survey

                                messages. Survey Participants provide us with 
                                the Information requested by you, for example, 
                                their gender or zip code, as well as all answers 
                                to the survey questions. Customers are solely

                                we do not control the theme or questions asked 
                                in any survey. In order to enhance survey response 
                                rates, we record: (i) if and when a Survey Participant 
                                has responded to a survey and (ii) if and when 
                                a Survey Participant has received a reminder. 
                                In addition, we receive any Information contained 
                                in any communications a Survey Participant makes 
                                directly with Zarca. <br>

                                survey data and for system administration purposes 
                                including tracking a user's session so that we

                                a user visits. To prevent the need to re-insert
