<div class="content">
  Zarca is an application service provider that provide you, our customer, tools to conduct two-way communications with your customers, employees, suppliers and constituents. Like the postal service, we understand that the Information we deliver belongs to you and your survey participants, not us. At Zarca, it is a core business principle that we must protect the privacy of our customers and survey participants or we will not have either. With this principle in mind, Zarca created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. <br>
  <br>
You should be assured that our practices stated in this policy are practiced worldwide. Zarca is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. We may share information between Zarca entities and transfer it to offices around the world. Some countries may provide less legal protection for personal information than the country in which the information was provided. No matter the country standards, we will still handle the information in the manner we describe here.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on our web site at the URL <a href="http://www.zarca.com">http://www.zarca.com</a> (the "Site") and our Zarca service platform. It does not speak about Zarca practices for information collected elsewhere or the practices of any third parties, including those of our partners who may display Zarca branding on their sites. The use of information collected through our service platform shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged Zarca.<br>
<br>

<div>
<div class="TextLeft"><strong>1. What Information do we collect?</strong></div>
<div class="TextRight">
  <p>Zarca collects information about both you, our customers ("Customers" or "you") and the individuals who participate in, or are invited to participate in, any of your surveys ("Survey Participants"). Collectively, the information collected about you ("Customer Information") and Survey Participants ("Participant Information") are referred to as "Information".</p>
  <p><em>Customer Information</em>: When Customers register on the Site, we ask you to give us your name and contact information: company name, name of contact, title of contact, company address, telephone number, email address, user name and password, and billing information which may include credit card numbers. Customers also provide us with Information regarding the Services you have ordered (e.g., the number of surveys Customers will pay for or whether you want a private or public survey). In addition to the Information you knowingly provide, we also know when and how often you log on to the Site. (See "Tracking Technologies" below.)</p>
  <p><em>Participant Information</em>: We receive Participant Information from both Customers and Survey Participants. You provide us with the email address, and sometimes the name, of each Participant. Before receiving such Information, we contractually require that you warranty that you have a pre-existing relationship with the Survey Participant and/or the Survey Participant's permission to receive electronic messages. Survey Participants provide us with the Information requested by you; for example, their gender or zip code, as well as all answers to the survey questions. Customers are solely responsible for the content of their surveys; we do not control the theme or questions asked in any survey. In order to enhance survey response rates, we record (i) if and when a Survey Participant has responded to a survey and (ii) if and when a Survey Participant has received a reminder. In addition, we receive any Information contained in any communications a Survey Participant makes directly with Zarca. (See "Tracking Technologies" below.) </p>
  <p>We also log Customer and Survey Participant Internet Protocol addresses to ensure the accuracy of the survey data and for system administration purposes including tracking a user's session so that we know when, how often and what pages of the Site a user visits. To prevent the need to re-insert user-name and password as you and your Survey Participants move from one page of the Site to the next, we do use a cookie. (See "Tracking Technologies" below).</p>
  <p>Our Web site includes a Social Media Feature such as the Facebook button that takes you to our Facebook Page. This Feature  may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. This Feature is hosted by Facebook. Your interactions with this Feature is governed by Facebook's privacy policy</p>
  <p>If you choose to use our referral service on Zarca to share an article from our site, we will ask you for your email address and your friend's email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email in your name inviting him or her to visit the site to review the article.  Zarca does not store this information and uses it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</p>
  <p>Zarca also collects information under the direction of its Clients on its service platform and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. Zarca works with its Clients to help them provide notice to their customers concerning, the purpose for which personal information is collected. </p>
  <strong>Tracking Technologies Employed on the Site and the Service Platforms</strong> 
  <p><em>Cookies</em><br>Like many websites, Zarca uses "cookies" to collect visitor information. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser. They make it possible for us to recognize your browser when you visit and to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously. For these purposes your personally identifiable information (such as email address) is tied to personally identifiable information. If you have provided your name or other contact information to Zarca via a web form, we are able to link that information back to the cookie. This information may be used to provide you with information that we believe to be relevant to you based on your actions on our website.</p>
  <p>We use persistent cookies.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. </p>
  <p><em>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</em><br>Our tracking utility company employs clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  These tracking technologies are not tied to our customers' personally identifiable information. The use of tracking technologies by our third party tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  
  </p><p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email. </p>
  <strong>Widgets</strong>
  <p>From time to time our site includes Widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site; they may also set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the third party company providing the Feature.<strong>Blogs/Forums</strong></p>
  <p>If you use a blog or forum on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
  <strong>Testimonials</strong>
  <p>From time to time, we post customer testimonials on our website which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. Before posting the testimonial, we obtain the customer's consent to post their name along with their testimonial.</p>
  <p>If you want to remove your personal information that is being displayed on our website under public pages please send your request to <a href="mailto:privacy@zarca.com">privacy@zarca.com</a></p>

</div>
</div>


<div><div class="TextLeft"><strong>2. How Do We Use Information?</strong></div>
<div class="TextRight">
  <p>We use your Customer Information in the normal course of our business, for reasons such as contacting you regarding technical support, discuss billing issues, or to bring to your attention any aspect of our mutual business. We may also use your contact information to provide you with policy or product updates or to introduce new products and services. If you do not wish to receive promotional emails from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email.</p>
  <p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature</p>
  <p>All Participant Information resides in our database primarily for the benefit of you, our Customers. At your direction, we use a Survey Participant's email address (and perhaps name) to send survey invitations and reminders. We also use Participant Information to improve the performance of our Site and services by analyzing site and user behavior, troubleshooting technical problems, resolving disputes and addressing complaints, and verifying compliance with the Terms of Service.</p>
  <p>If Zarca intends to use any Information in a manner that deviates from this Privacy Policy we will provide notice of how we intend to use that Information as we collect it. The use of that specific Information will be used solely as stated in the alternative disclosure.</p>
  <strong>Choice</strong>
  <p>We collect information for our Clients. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly.  If you are a Client and would like to update your account please contact us.</p>
  <strong>Data Retention</strong>
  <p>Zarca will retain personal data that we process on behalf of our Clients and data we collect from our Clients directly for as long as it is needed to provide services to our Clients.

We do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties who are not services providers.</p>
  <p><strong>(d) For Legal Reasons:</strong> We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
