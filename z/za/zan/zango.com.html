    <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Zango Privacy Policy</strong><br>(Last Revised April 03, 2008)</p>
    <p style="text-align:left">At Zango, Inc., we  are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to any Web  site ("Web site") that references this Policy and is provided by Zango or its  affiliates ("we" or "Zango"), and to those Zango-owned software products made  available to you from a Web site ("Software") (please see below for important  information on third party software products made available from the Web sites).  This Privacy Policy governs information you provide to us or that we learn from  you by your use of our Web sites and Software, and tells you how we may  collect, use, and, in some instances, share this information. </p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><strong>What We Collect and Use</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>Cookies.</strong> By accessing any Web site, Zango may place  cookies on your hard drive. Zango uses cookies to enable you to sign in to  certain services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a  small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. Some cookies  are used only to assist you with your session on a Web site – such cookies  expire automatically after you terminate your session. Zango also uses cookies  to improve the sign-in experience on certain Web sites. For example, your user  ID may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you  terminate your session. This cookie allows your user ID to be pre-populated, so  that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in.  Finally, Zango may place a cookie on your hard disk on behalf of a sponsor when  an advertisement for that sponsor is shown, so that the sponsor can measure the  effectiveness of that advertisement. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or  deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies can only be accessed or read by the  domain that placed them. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your  browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline  cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use certain features of a Web site  that depend on cookies.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>User-Provided Information.</strong> In order  to utilize the services at some Web sites (e.g., AdServices.Zango.com and  ZangoCash.com) you may be asked to provide certain personally identifiable  information, such as account information (user name and password), credit card  information (card type, account number, expiration date, and billing address),  banking information (Swift/ABA routing number, account number, bank name and  address), PayPal email, email address, IM user ID, name and company name, tax  identification number, and home or work address and telephone number, as well  as certain demographic information such as city, state, country and zip code  ("PII"). Zango uses your PII to deliver the services you have requested and to  communicate with you, including certain mandatory service communications such  as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues,  and security announcements. We may also occasionally send you product surveys  or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available  from Zango. All such information is provided voluntarily by you. If you provide  a friend’s email address to Zango for the "refer-a-friend" feature, we use that  email address only for the purpose of sending your friend the email you  requested. No PII is utilized by Zango for the purpose of displaying advertisements  or for profiling. Zango does not sell, rent or lease PII to third parties. <strong></strong></p>
    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>Software.</strong> In order to use Software, you  may be asked to provide certain information. For messenger Software products,  requested information may include IM account information (screen names and passwords) and personal information (including your email address,  date of birth, gender, and primary language). For desktop tool Software  products, requested information may include your astrological sign, zip code,  TV service provider, type of service, and channel line-up. All such information  is provided voluntarily by you. No such information is utilized by Zango for  the purpose of displaying advertisements or profiling. Zango does not sell,  rent or lease such information to third parties.<strong> </strong></p>
    <p style="text-align:left">Our Software product  automatically collects information from you to enable the Software’s services.  By installing the Software, you authorize Zango to periodically collect certain  information (1) (e.g., keywords and portions of Web site addresses or complete  URLs) from the Web sites you visit and upload this information to our servers so that we may display targeted advertisements to you  while you are connected to the Internet; and (2) (e.g., button impressions and  clicks) from the Toolbar products in your web browser and/or email application and  upload this information to our servers so that we may enhance the content offered  to you. The Software does not collect, store, or use PII, and Zango does not  receive PII, as a result of your use of this Software. <strong></strong></p>
    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>Third Party Software.</strong> Included with the Software may be third party  software from a Zango partner. Your registration for and use of any third party software is subject to that third party’s privacy  policy, if any. If you register for or use third party software, both  Zango and the third party software provider will receive any information  collected by Zango in conjunction with your registration, and Zango’s use of  your information is subject to this Privacy Policy. To determine how a Zango  partner may use your registration information, or may otherwise independently  be collecting other information through your use of third party software,  please refer to the third party software provider’s privacy policy.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>No Information  from Minors.</strong> You must be at least 18 years of age to use this Web site or Software. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>IP Addresses.</strong> Your use of any Software or Web site will involve the transmission of your Internet protocol  address ("IP Address") to Zango's servers. This IP Address is  necessary for communication with you via the Internet and may be used and  stored on our servers. We use IP Addresses to determine the general geographic  locations of our users; we do not link IP addresses to identify you personally  for marketing purposes. Zango does not share non-PII (pseudonymous)  information with third parties. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>Third Party  Collection.</strong> The Software will  display to you targeted Web sites and/or advertisements that are hosted by  third parties ("Third Party Hosted Advertisements"). These Third  Party Hosted Advertisements may place cookies on your hard drive and use the  cookies to tailor delivery of content to you by profiling your use of a site or  advertisements that you select. These Third Party Hosted Advertisements may  collect information such as your IP address, your browser type and the  date and time that the targeted Third Party Hosted Advertisement was served to  you. To learn about how certain of these third parties collect and use  information visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>Disclosure.</strong> Zango may disclose your information as it  believes is reasonably necessary to comply with law, regulation, or other  governmental authority, or to  prevent harm to yourself or others. Zango may also disclose your information  upon a transfer or sale to another  entity of all or substantially all of Zango's stock or assets in Zango's line  of business to which this Privacy Policy relates or upon any other corporate  reorganization. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>Control of your  Personal Information.</strong> Zango  offers you choices for the collection, use, and sharing of your personal  information. You may choose not to receive marketing materials from Zango, and  you may also stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from Zango by  following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive. These  communications choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that  are considered part of certain Zango services, which you may receive  periodically unless you cancel the service. You may have the ability to view or  edit your personal information, and can either do so through the applicable Web  site or by writing to us using our Contact Us form. We will contact you within  30 days regarding your request.<strong></strong></p>
    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>Linking to Other  Sites.</strong> A link on a Web site  or on a Third Party Web site does not imply Zango’s endorsement of such linked Web  site, advertiser, or product. We do not necessarily control the Web sites to  which we link and, in any event, assume no responsibility for their content or  privacy policies. Any information that you provide to linked Web sites, or  other third parties, is provided directly to such third party and is subject to  that third party's privacy policy. Therefore, you should carefully review the  privacy policies that apply to any Web sites you access from a Web site or  Software, and any advertisers you respond to. This Privacy Policy applies  solely to information collected by Zango. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left"><strong>Changes and  Updates.</strong> Zango reserves the  right to change the provisions of this Privacy Policy at any time. Zango will  post those changes on the privacy page of each Web site so you can be aware of  what information we collect and how we use it. Your use of a Web site or  Software following the posting of any change to the Privacy Policy will  constitute your acceptance of any such changes. We encourage you to review our  Privacy Policy frequently to make sure that you understand how Zango collects,  uses, and discloses information. </p>
