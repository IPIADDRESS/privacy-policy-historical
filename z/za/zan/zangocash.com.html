                    <p align="center"><strong>Zango Privacy Policy</strong><br>
(Last Revised March 19, 2007) </p>
                    <p>At Zango, Inc., we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to any website (“Website”) that references this Policy and is provided by Zango or its affiliates (“we” or “Zango”), and to those Zango-owned software products made available to you from a Website (“Software”) (please see below for important information on third party software products made available from the Websites). This Privacy Policy governs information you provide to us or that we learn from you by your use of our Websites and Software, and tells you how we may collect, use, and in some instances, share this information.</p>
                    <p align="center"><strong>What We Collect and Use</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> By accessing any Website, Zango may place cookies on your hard drive. Zango uses cookies to enable you to sign in to certain services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. Some cookies are used only to assist you with your session on a Website – such cookies expire automatically after you terminate your session. Zango also uses cookies to improve the sign-in experience on certain Websites. For example, your user ID may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you terminate your session. This cookie allows your user ID to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. Finally, Zango may place a cookie on your hard disk on behalf of a sponsor when such sponsor’s web page is shown, so that the sponsor can measure the effectiveness of such web page. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies can only be accessed or read by the domain that placed them. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use certain features of a Website that depend on cookies. </p>
                    <p><strong>User-Provided Information.</strong> In order to utilize the services at some Websites (e.g., AdServices.Zango.com and ZangoCash.com) you may be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as account information (user name and password), credit card information (card type, account number, expiration date, and billing address), banking information (Swift/ABA routing number, account number, bank name and address), PayPal email, email address, IM user ID, name and company name, tax identification number, and home or work address and telephone number, as well as certain demographic information such as city, state, country and zip code (“PII”). Zango uses your PII to deliver the services you have requested and to communicate with you, including certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Zango. All such information is provided voluntarily by you. If you provide a friend’s email address to Zango for the “refer-a-friend” feature, we use that email address only for the purpose of sending your friend the email you requested. No PII is utilized by Zango for the purpose of displaying targeted websites or for profiling. Zango does not sell, rent or lease PII to third parties. </p>

All such information is provided voluntarily by you . No such information is utilized by Zango for the purpose of displaying targeted websites or profiling. Zango does not sell, rent or lease such information to third parties.</p>

By installing the Software, you authorize Zango to periodically collect certain information (1) (e.g., keywords and portions of website addresses or complete URLs) from the websites you visit and upload this information to our servers so that we may display targeted websites to you while you are connected to the Internet; and (2) (e.g., button impressions and clicks) from the Toolbar products in your web browser and/or email application and upload this information to our servers so that we may enhance the content offered to you. The Software does not collect, store, or use PII, and Zango does not receive PII, as a result of your use of this Software. </p>
