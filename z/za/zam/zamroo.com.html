Capitalized terms which have been used here but are undefined shall have the same meaning as attributed to them in the Terms of Use.</p> 
					<p>As we update, improve and expand the Services, this policy may change, so please refer back to it periodically. By accessing the website or the mobile application or otherwise using the Services, you consent to collection, storage, and use of the personal information you provide (including any changes thereto as provided by you) for any of the services that we offer.</p>
					<p class="highlight">Acceptance of Terms</p>
					<p>Please read this privacy policy carefully since by visiting the Zamroo.com website and/or sharing information with us, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy may be revised or updated at any time by us with or without notice.</p>
					<p class="highlight">Summary</p>
					<p>Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our website. In general Zamroo.com (“Site” or “we”, or “us”) does not collect, use or disclose any data collected with an intention to personally identify and/or contact a person such as: name, address, etc (personally identifying information, hereinafter “Personal Information”) except in specific instances, for example, when you provide Personal Information through registering on the Site or as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  </p>
					<p class="highlight">Log Files</p>
					<p>Like many other Web portal, we also make use of log files. We automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, mobile number, including your IP address, when you visit our site, application or service. Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the pages you view. It also contains the additional information like type of browser, Internet Service Provider ( ISP ), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, track user’s movement around the site, and gather required demographic information.  </p>
					<p class="highlight">Cookies</p>
					<p>To improve the responsiveness of our Website and Mobile Application, we may use "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the identified computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us via website, Application or Service though your computer/laptop or mobile/tablet or any other handheld device etc.  </p>
					<p class="highlight">Opting out</p>
					<p>If a user opts out using the Ads Settings, the unique DoubleClick cookie ID on the user's browser is overwritten with the phrase "OPT_OUT". Because there is no longer a unique cookie ID, the opt-out cookie can't be associated with a particular browser.</p>

					<p class="highlight">Web Beacons </p>
					<p>We may use "clear GIFs" (Web Beacons) to track the online usage patterns of our users in an anonymous manner, without personally identifying the user.
