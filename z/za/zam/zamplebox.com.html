<article class="gutter-lg">
	<p>ZampleBox, LLC (“ZampleBox”, “We”, “Us” or “ Our”) values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. ZampleBox is an online service that delivers electronic cigarette products and supplies to its members once a month (“Services”). This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how and when We collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services. This Policy applies to our family of websites (the “Site(s)”). These include <a href="">www.zamplebox.com</a> and any other sites at which this Policy appears and the memberships that you can purchase on the Site to receive products that we offer or make available through the Sites (“Membership(s)”). By using Our Sites and/or purchasing a Membership you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize We to use your information in the United States and any other country where We operates. This Policy is incorporated by reference into the ZampleBox Terms of Service. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@zamplebox.com">hello@zamplebox.com</a>.</p>
	<h4 class="zb-green">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h4>
	<p>The information We collect from you enables us to fulfill your request for our products (electronic cigarette products that you order and receive through your Membership), to send you information or content in which you may be interested, and keep you abreast of any updates related to our Site and your Membership. We also use this information to personalize and continually improve our Site, your experience, and to ultimately serve you better.</p>
	<p><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong> You may browse our Site without registering. If you would like to place an order, become a member, and/or request information from us then we require you to register with us and become a member on our Sites. When you create, register, or edit your We account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, email address, and password. Please safeguard your password and other personal information. You may be liable for unauthorized use of our web site, as well as have your private information used by others. In some circumstances, such as making a purchase of our products, we will request that you provide your credit card, debit card, or acceptable payment option and your billing address and shipping address. You are welcome to not provide this information, but if you do not wish to provide this information then there is no way for us to provide you with our products and Services and therefore you cannot become a member.</p>
	<p>Information We Collect Automatically: In addition, when you visit the Sites and/or register for Membership, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons, and other automated devices. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to transmit information back to a web server. We also may use third-party website analytics tools (such as Omniture, Google Analytics, and Facebook Insights), that collect information about visitor traffic on the Sites.</p>
	<ul class="list-group">
		<li class="list-group-item active">The information we may collect by automated means includes:</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">Information about the devices our visitors use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and the device, browser, domain name and operating system type)</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">URLs that refer visitors to our sites</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">Dates and times of visits to our sites</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">Information on actions taken on our sites (such as page views and site navigation patterns)</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">A general geographic location (such as country and city) from which a visitor accesses our websites</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">Search terms that visitors use to reach our sites and the webpage that led you to the Sites </li>
	</ul>
	<h4 class="zb-green">COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGY:</h4>
	<p><strong>Cookies Information:</strong> Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Service. We uses cookies to help recognize you as a repeat visitor, to improve the quality of our Service, and to try and make your browsing experience meaningful. When you enter our Sites, our web server sends a cookie to your computer which allows us to recognize your computer but not specifically who is using it. By associating the identification numbers in the cookies with other customer information when, for example, you log-in to the Service, then we know that the cookie information relates to you. Some of the cookies used by our Service are served by us, and some are served by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different browsers. By blocking or deleting cookies used on our Service, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Service.</p>
	<p><strong>Local Storage Objects:</strong> We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) in order to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. In addition, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash cookies, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “ Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</p>
	<p><strong>Log File Information or Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”) created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, or visit a third-party website that includes a We button or widget. We uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>
	<p><strong>Clear Gifs Information:</strong> When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your We account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make We better for our users.</p>
	<p><strong>Site Analytics:</strong> As noted, we may use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Site. We use these tools to help us improve our Site, performance and user experiences.</p>
	<p><strong>Links:</strong> We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
	<p><strong>Third-Party Ad Networks:</strong> We may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on Our Sites. We may display advertisements on Our Sites, participate in third party ad networks and make available to Our Sites users specific offers from third-party companies. Some of the advertisements you see on the Sites are delivered by third parties who also collect information through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies about your online activities, either on Our Web Sites or across the Internet, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver you advertisements that are tailored to your interests. These third parties include advertisers, advertising agencies, and ad networks that may collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements. Third parties that currently collect information on our Sites for the purpose of serving you with advertising tailored to your interest include, but are not limited to Atlas, BlueKai, DoubleClick, EyeWonder, Google, Mediamind, Audience Science and Pointroll. These companies may offer you a way to choose not to have your information used for advertising purposes. You can find more information by clicking on the company names above and following the links to each company’s web site.</p>

To opt out of information collection by NAI member companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit the NAI consumer opt out page.
