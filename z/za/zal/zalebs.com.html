<p>
	If you expressly consent to us using your personal information for marketing purposes, we may also use it to send you relevant marketing, promotional and advertising material, newsletters and other communications offering you products and information about products and services (including by means of direct marketing) offered by us, our affiliates and other third party providers from time to time, which products and services we think may be of interest to you.</p>
