		</div>--><p>This overall Privacy statement verifies, among other things, that Zagat Survey, LLC ("we" or "us" or "Zagat") on the Web is a member of the TRUSTe program and is in compliance with TRUSTe Privacy principles.</p>
<p>Zagat Survey, LLC is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your Privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its Privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this Web site has agreed to notify you of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personally identifiable information about you or a third party that is collected from you through the Web site</li>
<li>The organization collecting the information</li>
<li>How the information is used</li>
<li>With whom the information may be shared</li>
<li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information</li>
<li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Zagat Survey's control</li>
<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information</li>
</ol>
<p>We always have and always will respect your privacy. Any information that you give us is held with the utmost care and will not be used other than as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Zagat Survey has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy on ZAGAT.com and ZAGAT.mobi (the "Zagat Site(s)"). The "Zagat" name and reputation have been built on the trust of our customers, and we hope that our commitment to online privacy will inspire the same trust in you while you are visiting the Zagat Sites.</p>
<p>We have adopted a set of information management guidelines that serve as the basis for our customer relationships. These guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet and mobile technologies are rapidly evolving. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. Any such changes will be posted on this page. Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you use the Zagat Sites. Please see our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> for more information about our online policies in general.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact us via 'Ask a Question' in our online <a href="http://zagatsurvey.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/zagatsurvey.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php" target="_blank">Help</a> section. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe: <a href="http://www.truste.com/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_blank">http://www.truste.com/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the website to resolve your concerns.</p>
<p>Note: We permit users of the Zagat Sites to access and download certain software applications (e.g., ZAGAT TO GO(SM) and Golf by Zagat(SM)). This Privacy Policy does not cover any Personally Identifiable Information that may be collected through those software applications.</p>
<h4>The Information We Collect</h4>
<p>We collect personal information from you on the Zagat Sites when you provide it and in some cases, from third party sources such as credit card companies in order to ensure that your credit card information is up-to-date.</p>
<p>User Registration. Registration on the Zagat Sites is strictly voluntary. To register for the Zagat Sites, you must provide your e-mail address, name, country and year of birth. This information is required in the registration process but we recognize that this is your personal information and, except as we explain below, we do not give it out to third parties without your approval. In order to vote in a featured survey and purchase items in our Shop, we require that you provide a valid mailing address. Additional demographic information, such as your occupation, level of education, household income and special interests, are also collected in an "optional information" area. In this section, you are not required to provide additional information about yourself that you may find personal. We do this to learn more about you in tailoring our website for your needs and preferences. We also will collect your phone number for shipping and billing information if you purchase an item at the ZAGAT.com store. Also, at some point we may ask you for optional information with regard to your personal preferences on dining, travel and leisure activities to personalize your experiences on the Zagat Sites, but this information will be optionally provided by you as well. If you choose to sign up for ZAGAT.mobi, you can provide your mobile phone number so we can send you a text message with a link to ZAGAT.mobi. To learn the benefits of becoming a premium member or to send us feedback on ZAGAT.mobi, you may also enter your email address. At any time you may later review or update the personal information we have collected online from you by logging on with your user name and password and then going to the "Account" section within "My Profile".</p>
<p>Subscriptions to the Zagat Sites. To subscribe to the Zagat Sites, you must provide the personal information requested in ZAGAT.com's subscription process, including, without limitation, your name, address, e-mail address, other information required in order to become a registered user of the Zagat Sites, and your credit card information for subscription fee billing. This information is required in the subscription process, but we recognize that this is your personal information and, except as we explain below, we do not give it out to third parties without your approval. Becoming a subscriber of the Zagat Sites provides you with the benefits described in the subscriber section of ZAGAT.com, including access to certain content that is not available to persons who are not subscribers and a discount for purchases in our store. The Subscriber Agreement applies to your subscription to the Zagat Sites. In addition, as a subscriber to the Zagat Sites, you will also automatically become a registered user of the Zagat Sites, thereby subjecting you to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy applicable to registered users, and you will be entitled to all of the benefits and privileges available to registered users of the Zagat Sites.</p>
<p>Member Reviews. In order to submit your ratings and reviews on the Zagat Sites you will need to create a username. You will have the option of sharing your reviews with other members of the Zagat Sites. If you so choose on your personal profile, the following pieces of information will be shared on the site along with your reviews: (i) your username, (ii) your home city and state, (iii) the month and year that you became a subscriber to the Zagat Sites and (iv) the total number of reviews submitted. In addition, you will have the option to add the following additional information to your profile, in which case this information will also be shared on the site: (i) gender, (ii) age range and (iii) personal description.</p>
<p>Discussion Boards. In order to participate on our discussion boards, you will need to register on the Zagat Sites. If you use our discussion boards, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
<p>Credit Card Policy. To simplify ordering and product fulfillment in our store and/or for your subscription to the Zagat Sites, if applicable, we request your credit card number, its expiration date and your billing and shipping address. We transmit this information safely over the Internet in encrypted form and store it on a secure server. This information is used only to bill you for and ship to you the products that you order or to bill you for your subscription to the Zagat Sites or other services available on the Zagat Sites.</p>
<p>Cookies. The Zagat Sites employ cookies (small pieces of text stored on your computer) to recognize you and your access privileges. For example, we use cookies to allow you to log on to the Zagat Sites automatically without entering your ID and password each visit. Cookies also identify you and your preferences on our site. For these purposes, these cookies are tied to your personally identifiable information. You may refuse to accept our cookies, but we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user or subscriber, which will limit your access to the site.</p>
<p>Location Selector. If you choose to enter a street address when selecting a location, this information will be saved for your convenience in your Recent Locations list or in your Saved Locations list should you so indicate. This information may make it easier for you to browse and search our content and will not be used for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Tell a Friend. If you choose to email or SMS a list, review or link to a friend from the Zagat Sites, we collect the friend's name, e-mail address, and/or mobile phone number. This information is used only to deliver a one-time message to your friend and is not stored on our servers. If "a friend" decides that he/she will register with the Zagat Sites, he or she will be given the same rights of access as registered users of the Zagat Sites. The prospect information that you submit for "a friend" will be used only for the use for which it is submitted. Additionally, for "a friend" to register, he or she will have to follow the Zagat Site's registration process (see above) and will be given the same option in regard to receiving marketing materials that the Zagat Sites offer to all registered users.</p>
<p>IP Addresses. ZAGAT.com logs IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.</p>
<h4>Facebook Connect</h4>
<p>The Zagat Sites allow users to access Facebook Connect to interact with friends and to share on Facebook through Wall and friends' News Feeds. If you are already logged into Zagat and Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be prompted to merge your profiles. If you are already logged into Zagat but not logged into Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to "Sign up for Facebook." By proceeding, you are allowing the Zagat Sites to access your information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use in your use of Zagat Sites.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a Zagat user and you click on "Sign in Using Facebook," you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join Zagat. Once you register on the Zagat sites and Connect with Facebook, you will be able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook. You have the option to disable Facebook Connect at any time by logging into "My Profile" and clicking on "My Facebook Profile." Further, you can edit privacy settings for the reviews that appear on Facebook or disconnect this service by visiting the Facebook Application Settings page.</p>
<h4>Third Party Advertising</h4>
<p>The ads appearing on this website are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Internet advertising partner. Information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad, is used to serve ads to you. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please click <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Third Party Cookies</h4>
<p>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See "Third Party Advertising."</p>
<h4>How We Use Your Information</h4>
<p>We use your e-mail address and home address to send you updates and newsletters periodically about new features, special offers and targeted promotional items available on the Zagat Sites. You may choose to not receive certain of these communications by so indicating during the registration process or in response to one of our e-mails or postal mailings. Each communication will clearly explain how to opt out of future communications. Any demographic information that you voluntarily share with us is used to tailor the Zagat Sites to your interests. We also may share this demographic information with other companies with which we do business.</p>
<h4>With Whom We Share Information</h4>
<p>We share your personally identifiable information with intermediaries. These intermediaries use your information in connection with processing payments for online purchases and with delivery of e-mail and postal mailings to our registered users. We do not permit these intermediaries to use, store or retain this information for secondary purposes, unless they indicate otherwise in communications to you. From time to time we may allow some of our select partners to send you special promotional offers that we believe may be of special interest to you. You may choose not to receive these communications from our partners by so indicating during the registration process or in response to any of these communications, each of which will clearly explain how to opt out of future communications. You may also opt out of having your personal information shared with these third parties by sending a request to have your user account deactivated via 'Ask a Question' in our online <a href="http://zagatsurvey.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/zagatsurvey.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php" target="_blank">Help</a> section. If you do so, however, you will not be able to take advantage of many of our features, including the right to vote online, purchase items from our store and even continue as a subscriber to the Zagat Sites. We make use of certain tracking technology designed to enhance your browsing experience and provide analytics. These technologies, provided as a hosted service application, provide aggregate reporting information to the site owner only, through cookies that they set at the Zagat Sites. No personal or personally identifiable information is gathered for this process. We do retain the right to share and transfer all user information with a purchaser of our company or all or substantially all of our assets if that purchaser agrees to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>Legal Disclaimer</h4>
<p>We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform with the law or legal process or to protect or defend our rights or property.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>The Zagat Sites have security measures in place to help protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All information is stored in a secure operating environment. When sending sensitive information across the Internet - including your login ID, password and purchasing information such as credit cards - we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. Internally, all customer information is protected with multiple security checks. Employee access to the system is limited to the functionality necessary for each person's job. Relevant employees are informed of our security policies and their access to applications and data on our network.</p>
<p>If you still do not feel comfortable about leaving your credit card information on our secured Web site, please contact our customer service department at (800) 540-9609 and we'll be happy to help you with your order or subscription.</p>
<h4>Special Policy With Regard to Information From Children Under Thirteen</h4>
<p>Zagat Survey does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for Zagat Sites or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to Zagat Survey. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we may have any information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us.</p>
<h4>Links</h4>
<p>We may provide links to third party websites as a service to our users. Please be aware that we cannot control and are not responsible for the information collection practices of such websites, which may differ from those of the Zagat Sites. We encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies on these websites before providing any information to them.</p>
<h4>How You Can Access or Correct Your Information</h4>
<p>If you are a registered user you can review or make changes to your personal information at any time by going to the "Account" section within "My Profile" on ZAGAT.com. You may also submit changes via "Ask a Question" in our online <a href="http://zagatsurvey.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/zagatsurvey.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php" target="_blank">Help</a> section.</p>

<h4>Notification of Changes</h4>
<p>If we decide to materially change our Privacy Policy, we will post changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. Regardless of later updates, we will never use the information you submit under this current policy in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prevent that use (we will post a notification of such changes 30 days prior to their implementation). You may determine when this Privacy Policy was updated last by noting the "Last Updated" date directly beneath the title of this page.</p>
