Additional demographic information, such as your occupation, level of education, household income and special interests, are also collected in an "optional information" area. In this section, you are not required to provide additional information about yourself that you may find personal. We do this to learn more about you in tailoring our Web site for your needs and preferences. We also will collect your phone number for shipping and billing information if you purchase an item at the zagat.com store. Also, at some point we may ask you for optional information with regard to your personal preferences on dining, travel and leisure activities to personalize your experiences on zagat.com, but this information will be optionally provided by you as well. At any time you may later review or update the personal information we have collected online from you by logging on with your user name and password and then going to the ”My Account” link.

<strong>Cookies</strong>. zagat.com employs cookies (small pieces of text stored on your computer) to recognize you and your access privileges. For example, we use cookies to allow you to log on to zagat.com automatically without entering your ID and password each visit. Cookies also identify you and your preferences on our site. You may refuse to accept our cookies, but we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user or subscriber, which will limit your access to the site.
<br><br><strong>Location Selector</strong>. If you choose to enter a street address when selecting a location, this information will be saved for your convenience in your Recent Locations list or in your Saved Locations list should you so indicate. This information may make it easier for you to browse and search our content and will not be used for any other purpose.
<br><br>
<strong> E-mail a Review &amp; E-mail a List</strong>. If you choose to e-mail a list or a review to a friend, we collect the friend's name and e-mail address. This information is used only to deliver the review to your friend and is not stored on our servers. If "a friend" decides that he/she will register with zagat.com, he or she will be given the same rights of access as registered users of zagat.com. The prospect information that you submit for "a friend" will be used only for the use for which it is submitted. Additionally, for "a friend" to register, he or she will have to follow zagat.com's registration process (see above) and will be given the same option in regard to receiving marketing materials that zagat.com offers to all registered users.
<br><br>
<strong>IP Addresses</strong>. zagat.com logs IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. Your IP address is not linked to any personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>. This site uses Falk to serve and/or target ads, promotions and other marketing messages. This technology collects non-personally identifiable information about your visit to this and other sites, typically through the use of cookies set by Falk. This information is used in aggregate format only to optimize the zagat.com web site.
<br><br>
<strong>How We Use Your Information</strong><br>
We use your e-mail address and home address to send you updates and newsletters periodically about new features, special offers and targeted promotional items available on zagat.com. You may choose to not receive certain of these communications by so indicating during the registration process or in response to one of our e-mails or postal mailings. Each communication will clearly explain how to opt out of future communications. Any demographic information that you voluntarily share with us is used to tailor zagat.com to your interests. We also may share this demographic information with other companies with which we do business.
<br><br>
<strong>With Whom We Share Information</strong><br>
We share your personally identifiable information with intermediaries. These intermediaries use your information in connection with processing payments for online purchases and with delivery of e-mail and postal mailings to our registered users. We do not permit these intermediaries to use, store or retain this information for secondary purposes, unless they indicate otherwise in communications to you. From time to time we may allow some of our select partners to send you special promotional offers that we believe may be of special interest to you. You may choose not to receive these communications from our partners by so indicating during the registration process or in response to any of these communications, each of which will clearly explain how to opt out of future communications. You may also opt out of having your personal information shared with these third parties by sending a request to have your zagat.com user account deactivated to feedback@zagat.com.
