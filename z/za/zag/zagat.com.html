	<font face="Arial" size="2">We use your e-mail address 
	and home address to send you updates and newsletters periodically about 
	new features, special offers and targeted promotional items available on 
	zagat.com. You may choose to not receive certain of these communications by so 
	indicating during the registration process or in response to one of our 
	e-mails or postal mailings. Each communication will clearly explain how to opt 
	out of future communications. Any demographic information that you 
	voluntarily share with us is used to tailor zagat.com to your interests. 
	We also may share this demographic information with other companies with 
	which we do business, but only on an aggregated basis so that none of your 
	personally identifiable information is disclosed.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="3">

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>With Whom We Share Information</b><br>
	<font size="2">We share your personally identifiable 
	information with intermediaries. These intermediaries use your information 
	only in connection with processing payments for online purchases that 
	you've made in our Shop, or for online reservations, and with delivery of 
	e-mail and postal mailings to our registered users who have elected to 
	receive these types of communications. These intermediaries do not use, 
	store or retain this information for secondary purposes, unless they indicate otherwise in communications to you. From time to time 
	we may allow some of our select partners to send you special promotional 
	offers that we believe may be of special interest to you. You may choose 
	not to receive these communications from our partners by so indicating 
	during the registration process or in response to any of these 
	communications, each of which will clearly explain how to opt out of future 
	communications. You may also opt out of having your personal information 
	shared with these third parties by sending a request to 
	<a href="mailto:feedback@zagat.com">feedback@zagat.com</a>. By doing this, you will have chosen to 
	opt-out of having any of your personal information shared with a 
	thirdparty. In addition, we may disclose personal information if required 
	to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary 
	to conform with the law or legal process or to protect or defend our 
	rights or property.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="3">

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Security</b><br><font size="2">zagat.com has security measures in place 
	to help protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All information is 
	stored in a secure operating environment. When sending sensitive information across the Internet - including 
	your login ID, password and purchasing information such as credit cards - we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 
	encryption provided by VeriSign. This software encrypts all information sent or received so that it 
	cannot be intercepted and used by a foreign party. Once your information is received, it is stored on 
	a secure server and access to your data is restricted to you and authorized personnel who process your 
	orders and requests. Internally, all customer information is protected with multiple security checks. 
	Each employee is granted access to our data with a username and password. Employee access to the system 
	is limited to the functionality necessary for each person's job.
	<br><br>
	Our employee orientation program 
	includes a discussion of data integrity and network security. Employees are informed of our security 
	policies and their access to applications and data on our network. 
	<br><br>
	The Internet is a constantly 
	evolving environment and we continuously add new content and functionality to zagat.com. As such, we 
	conduct reviews of our privacy and security policies and procedures regularly when changes are made 
	to our site, when content is added and when new applications are implemented.
	<br><br>
	Shopping online with zagat.com and providing your credit card information to zagat.com for 
	other purposes, including subscribing to Zagat Wire, is safe and secure. We utilize VeriSign Secure 
	Socket Layers (SSL) technology to ensure 
	the secure transfer of your personal and credit card information through encryption. When a secure 
	connection is initiated, our server's public key is automatically transferred to your browser. Your 
	browser then uses this key to encrypt information transferred back to zagat.com. This information can 
	only be decrypted using the private key installed on zagat.com's secure server.
	<br><br>
	Having a secure 
	sever takes much of the risk out of your credit card transactions. We also do all order processing and 
	fulfillment on software that is separate from the Internet, so there is no danger of any unauthorized 
	person gaining access to your order information.
	<br><br>
	If you still do not feel comfortable about 
	leaving your credit card information on our secured Web site, please contact our customer service 
	department at (800) 333-3421 and we'll be happy to help you with your order or subscription.</font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="3">
