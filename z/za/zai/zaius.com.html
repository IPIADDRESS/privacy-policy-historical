<h2>Users of Our Customers' Websites</h2>
<p>Zaius's clients and customers ("Customers") may use our Analytics Services, which includes certain code, software, cookies and other tracking mechanisms, and services to obtain information regarding the activities that users engage in while visiting their websites ("Customer Analytics Data"). When a user visits a website that uses our Analytics Service, code contained on the website contacts our servers and enables Zaius to collect Customer Analytics Data.  Some Customers may also use their own code to obtain analytics data about users of their websites and services, and then send such information to our servers.  Customer Analytics Data is stored on Zaiusâ€™ web servers and databases for use in performing analysis and producing reports for Customers, and for other purposes explained in this Policy.</p>
<p>Our Analytics Services are used to collect and analyze behavioral, usage and activity information about the use of our Customers' websites and online services. The Analytics Services will collect certain non-personally identifiable analytics data, including (but not limited to) IP address and location information, website URL, referring URL, pages viewed (including page address, name and title, data and time of access, and length of time spent on each page), activities on each page (including links clicked and search terms entered), operating system, browser type, User Agent header information, web page performance information, campaign information, java version, flash version, resolution and screen information, and language information.  Zaius Customers can also use the Analytics Services to collect additional Customer Analytics Data, (including personally identifiable data).  The collection and use of Customer Analytics Data by or on behalf of a Customer, is subject to the Customer's Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

We also may use the information that we learn to assist us in advertising the Analytics Services and our other services on third party websites.</li>
<li>To better understand how users access and use our Site and Analytics Services, in order to improve our Site and Analytics Services and respond to user desires and preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes.</li>
<li>To compile aggregate data derived from our Analytics Services (including the Customer Analytics Data of multiple Customers) to compile statistics, metrics, insights and general trend data about Zaius, website activity and behavioral data (on an aggregate and individual basis) and the use of the Analytics Services for, among other things, Zaius' internal use, research, marketing and promotional purposes, and as part of our other analytics services.</li>
<li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or this Policy and to protect or defend the rights of Zaius.</li>

<h2>HOW WE DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p>We do not share the information we collect or receive with third parties for their own marketing purposes. We may disclose the information that we collect as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Service Providers.</b> We may disclose the information we collect to third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf and are not permitted to use such data except on behalf of Zaius.</li>
<li><b>Customers.</b>  A Customer is able to access and review the information collected or received by us in connection with that Customers' use of the Analytics Services.</li>
<li><b>Visitors to Our Site.</b> Your user name and any information that you post to our Site, including, without limitation, reviews, comments, and text may be available to, and searchable by, other visitors to our Site.</li>
<li><b>Business Transfers.</b> If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected to the other company.</li>
<li><b>In Response to Legal Process.</b> We also may disclose the information we collect in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.</li>

<h2>OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING MECHANISMS</h2>
<p>We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms, such as standard server logs, and clear GIFs (also known as "Web beacons"), to track information about your use of our Site or services, and as part of the Analytics Services. We may combine this information with other personally identifiable information we have collected or received about you. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computerâ€™s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site, others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site as well as to collect Customer Analytics Data.</p>
<p><b>Disabling Cookies.</b> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. Disabling cookies may affect the functionality of the websites and online services you use.</p>
<p><b>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</b> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computerâ€™s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We, and our third party service providers, also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>
<h2>THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS AND TRACKING</h2>
<p>In addition to our own Analytics Services, we may use automated devices and applications to evaluate usage of our Site.  As part of this, we may allow third party cookies to be placed on your computer from our Site so that these third parties may provide us with analytics and related services. We use these tools to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.  These third parties may combine the information they collect about you on our Site with information they have collected on other websites; such collection and use is subject to their privacy policy, not this one.</p>
<h2>USER GENERATED CONTENT</h2>
<p>We invite registered users to post content on our Site, including your comments, pictures, and any other information that you would like to be available on our Site. If you post content to our Site, all of the information that you post will be available to our registered customers. If you post your own content on our Site or services, your posting may become public and we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.</p>
<h2>THIRD-PARTY LINKS</h2>
<p>Our Site and services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.</p>
<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>We have implemented security precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.  You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>
<h2>MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
<p>We may send periodic promotional emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails related to your account or any services you have requested or received from us.</p>
<h2>CHILDREN UNDER 13</h2>
<p>Our Site is not designed for users under 18 and our Analytics Services may only be used by Customers over 18 years of age. Further, our Analytics Services may not be used to collect information from children under 13 years of age or on websites that are directed to children under 13 years of age; if we discover that we have collected personal information from children under 13, we will take steps to securely delete such information.</p>
