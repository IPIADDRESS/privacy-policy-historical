			<u>Information Collected by Cookies:</u><br>
			Zazzle uses cookies on the Zazzle Website.  A cookie is a small text file on your computer which a website sends to your computer to allow the website to store information which uniquely identifies our users.  Zazzle's cookies do not collect or store personally identifiable information.  Rather, the cookie stores a token which uniquely identifies a particular user at a particular time. That token is then linked to the user information in our secured databases. You can always reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to display a message when a cookie is being sent.  If you reset your browser, some of the Zazzle Website features and functionality may not be available to you.<br>
			<br>
			
			<u>Information Collected by Web Beacons and Log Files:</u><br> Zazzle collects certain non-personally identifiable information through the use of web beacons and log files.  Such information may include your IP address, browser type, site usage, and whether you opened emails you received from us.<br>
			<br>			
			
			<b>How do we secure your information?</b><br> When you place orders or access your account information, we use commercially reasonable and generally-accepted technological safeguards to secure any information we collect about you.  The secure server software (SSL) we use encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. In addition, your MyZazzle account information is password-protected for your privacy and security.  You should always take steps to protect the confidentiality of the password you select.<br><br>

We operate internationally and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States.  As a result, your personal data will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union.  If you create a user account with us, you agree to this privacy policy and you consent to the transfer of all information you provide to the United States.  
<br>
			<br>
			<b>How do we use information?</b><br> We use the personally identifiable information you provide to:
			<ul>
				<li>provide the features and functionality of the Zazzle Website;</li>
				<li>fulfill your requests for our products and services;</li>
				<li>pay royalties and referral fees;</li>
				<li>communicate with you about the status of your orders and other inquiries about our products and services;</li>
				<li>send you information about our products and services; and</li>
				<li>provide notices about the results of sweepstakes, contest, and other promotions.</li>
			</ul>
			We use your email address to communicate with you about your account and to send you certain notification emails.  You can change the frequency of those emails in your MyZazzle account settings.<br><br>

			We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send marketing messages without your consent.  Similarly, if you email a product to a friend or refer a friend to the Zazzle Website or our promotions, we will use your friend's email to send them the e-mail you requested.  You and your friend's e-mail addresses will only be used for this purpose unless permission is otherwise granted.<br><br>

			We use non-personally identifiable information to monitor the use and performance of the Zazzle Website so that we can learn more about how people use the Zazzle Website and improve our products and services.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Does Zazzle disclose the information it collects to outside parties?</b><br> Generally, Zazzle does not share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies without your consent except that:  <br>
			<br>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
			
				Zazzle provides information to its agents and trusted service providers and contractors for limited purposes, such as:  fulfilling customer orders and processing credit card transactions; offering certain products and services; communicating with customers; providing customer service; managing information on our behalf; and enhancing the Zazzle Website features and functionality.  In such cases, we require that these parties agree to use the information solely for the purpose for which we provided it to them and in accordance with our privacy policy.<br><br>

				If you sign up for a promotion (e.g., a contest or sweepstakes offer) or enroll in a service we offer in partnership with a third party, we may provide information (such as your name, email address, and account activity) to such third parties.<br><br>

				From time-to-time, Zazzle may provide its contributors with the first name and city/state/country of residence of Zazzle customers who have purchased such contributor's products.<br><br>

				Zazzle may also release information (including your name, addresses, telephone number, and account activity) when we, in our sole discretion believe that such release is necessary or appropriate to: 
				</p><ul>
					<li>comply with law;</li>
					<li>comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders, government investigations, or other legal process;</li>
					<li>enforce or apply the terms of any of our user or license agreements; </li>
					<li>investigate or respond to allegations of fraud, intellectual property infringement, or other unlawful activity</li>
					<li>investigate fraud or similar claims; or</li>
					<li>protect the rights, property or safety of Zazzle, our users, or others. </li>
				</ul>
				Additionally, Zazzle releases certain information to report the sale of custom postage to the United States Postal Service ("USPS").  As part of our relationship with the USPS, we collect and may disclose information about purchasers of our Zazzle Stamps products to the USPS at the request of USPS.  To learn more about the USPS's privacy policy, please visit the <a href="http://www.usps.com/homearea/docs/privpol_long.htm" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.<br><br>

				In the event that Zazzle is acquired by, or merged with, another company Zazzle reserves the right to transfer all information we have collected from our users in connection with such acquisition or merger.
			
			<p></p>
			
			Zazzle may disclose non-personally-identifiable information to third parties in aggregate form to potential business partners and investors.<br><br>
			
			
			<b>What about Children's Privacy? </b><br>
				Children under the age of thirteen are allowed to upload graphics and images and to order products with their parent's consent.  To order products, the child must indicate his or her age, submit his or her name and his or her mailing address and shipping address if different from the mailing address together with a valid credit card number.  In addition, in order to generate custom postage, we must collect and record the following information:  the date and time of the custom postage order, a unique order i.d., the amount of postage ordered in the transaction, and the zip code of the recipient of the custom postage. This is the only information collected from a child.<br><br>
				 
				This information is used to fulfill the requested order; confirm shipment; complete record keeping including royalty entitlements and pay royalty fees, if any, to report the sale of custom postage to the United States Postal Service, and to advise the child concerning new Zazzle products, services or policies.<br><br>
				 
				Parents of children under the age of 13 have the option to consent to the collection of this information from their children or not.  Such consent will not be used as consent for the dissemination of any of this information and the information will not be released by Zazzle to third parties without the parents' consent except as may be required by law or upon court order.<br><br>

				Personal information at Zazzle is kept confidential and is disclosed only with the consent of the Zazzle user or as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  We do not engage in the selling of the habits, behavior, buying patterns, or demographic information of our users.  Zazzle does not condition a child's participation in any on-line activity on the granting of any unnecessary information beyond that actually needed in connection with that activity.<br><br>
				 
				Parents can review any information Zazzle has received from a child and the parent can have that information deleted and the parent can forbid the collection of additional information from their child.  If you want to review any information obtained from your child or if you want to have any information obtained from your child deleted from the Zazzle records or to forbid any use of such information, you may send a request to Zazzle Customer Support by logging into Zazzle, going to:<br><br>
