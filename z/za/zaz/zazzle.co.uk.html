	<h5>Information collected by Cookies:</h5>

	<p>
		Zazzle uses cookies on the Site to improve the quality of our site and services to you. A cookie is a small text file on your computer which a website sends to your computer to allow the website to store information which uniquely identifies our users. Zazzle's cookies do not collect or store personally identifiable information. Rather, the cookie stores a token which uniquely identifies a particular user at a particular time. That token is then linked to the user information in our secured databases. You can always delete the cookies and reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to display a message when a cookie is being sent. However, we rely on cookies for the proper operation of the Site and if you reset your browser, some of the Site features and functionality may not be available to you and you may not be able to take advantage of all the features on the Site.
	</p>

	<p>
		We may work with other companies who place cookies or web beacons on our website. These companies help operate our websites and provide you with additional products and services. They are subject to confidentiality agreements with Zazzle and other legal restrictions. Zazzle does not permit any of these companies to collect personal information using cookies or web beacons on our websites. Certain functionalities related to the provision of additional products and services require marketers to share website usage information about visitors to the Site, who have received a targeted promotional campaign, with a reputable third-party advertising company for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. To this end, Zazzle's third-party advertising company makes a note of some of the pages you visit on the Site through the use of pixel tags.
	</p>

	<h5>Information collected by Web Beacons and Log Files:</h5>
	<p>
		Zazzle collects information through the use of web beacons and log files that is not usually personally identifiable information. Such information may include your IP address, browser type, site usage, and whether you opened emails you received from us.

If you submit a review, we may publish your geographic location or other anonymous information but your email address will be kept private. Additionally, any personally identifiable information that you submit as part of the review can be read or used by other visitors to the Site. We are not responsible for keeping private or secure any personally identifiable information that you choose to submit as part of your review. We believe you can post a helpful review without disclosing any personal information.
	</p>

	<h5>Information transferred as the result of the sale of business</h5>
	<p>
		By registering with Zazzle you agree that Zazzle may disclose your personally identifiable information to any member of our group, which includes our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and their subsidiaries, and affiliates. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personally identifiable information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets if it is specifically relevant to them.  In particular, if Zazzle or substantially all of its assets are acquired by another party, your personally identifiable information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.
	</p>

	<h4>
		How do we secure your information?
	</h4>
	<p>
		When you place orders or access your account information, we use commercially reasonable and generally-accepted technological safeguards to secure any information we collect about you. The secure server software (SSL) we use encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. In addition, your Zazzle account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. You should always take steps to protect the confidentiality of the password you select. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.
	</p>
	<p>
		We operate internationally and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States. As a result, your personal data will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with us, you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all information you provide to us in the United States.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may also choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.
	</p>
	<p>
		We work very hard to protect your privacy, but we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee complete security.
	</p>

	<h4>How do we use information?</h4>

	</p>

	<p>

Your friend's e-mail addresses will only be used for this purpose unless permission is otherwise granted. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We use non-personally identifiable information to monitor the use and performance of the Site so that we can learn more about how people use the Site which helps us improve our products and services and significantly enhance your experience on our website.
	</p>

	<h4>
		Does Zazzle disclose the information it collects to outside parties?
	</h4>
	
	<p>
		Generally, Zazzle does not share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies without your consent except that:
	</p>

	<p>
		Zazzle provides information to its agents and trusted service providers and contractors for limited purposes, such as fulfilling customer orders and processing credit card transactions; offering certain products and services; communicating with customers; providing customer service; managing information on our behalf; and enhancing the Site features and functionality. In such cases, we require that these parties agree to use the information solely for the purpose for which we provided it to them and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you sign up for a promotion (e.g., a contest or sweepstakes offer) or enroll in a service we offer in partnership with a third party, we may provide information (such as your name, email address, and account activity) to such third parties.
	</p>

	<p>
		Zazzle provides its sellers with the first name and city/state/country of residence of Zazzle customers who have purchased such seller's products. Zazzle may also release information (including your name, addresses, telephone number, and account activity) when we, in our sole discretion believe that such release is necessary or appropriate to: 
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>comply with legal obligations;</li>
		<li>comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders, government investigations, or other legal process;</li>
		<li>enforce or apply the terms of any of our user or license agreements;</li>
		<li>investigate or respond to allegations of fraud, intellectual property infringement, or other unlawful activity</li>
		<li>investigate fraud or similar claims;</li>
		<li>protect the rights, property or safety of Zazzle, our users, or others.</li>
		<li>to protect our operations; or</li>
		<li>to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</li>
	</ul>
		
	<p>
		Additionally, Zazzle releases certain information to report the sale of custom postage to the United States Postal Service ("USPS"). As part of our relationship with the USPS, we collect and may disclose information about purchasers of our Zazzle Custom Stamps products to the USPS at the request of USPS. To learn more about the USPS's privacy policy, please visit the <a href="http://www.usps.com/homearea/docs/privpol_long.htm" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the event that Zazzle is acquired by, or merges with, another company Zazzle reserves the right to transfer all information we have collected from our users in connection with such acquisition or merger.
	</p>
	<p>
		Zazzle may disclose non-personally-identifiable information to third parties in aggregate form to potential business partners and investors.
	</p>

	<h4>Advertising</h4>
	<p>
		Zazzle may use third party service providers to place ads on our behalf across the internet and sometimes on the Site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a web beacon, which is industry standard technology used by most major sites. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service providers, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@zazzle.com">privacy@zazzle.com</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition, Zazzle is a dynamic marketplace with a great number of branded products and content. We will offer our users the opportunity to opt-in to receive emails, notifications of promotions and the like offered by our partners from such partners.

	<h4>Does this Privacy Policy apply when I access third party websites?</h4>
	<p>
		You may be able to access third party websites directly from the Site. However, this Privacy Policy does not apply when you access third party websites. We cannot control how third parties may use personal information you disclose to them, so you should carefully review the privacy policy of any third party website you visit before using it or disclosing your personal information to its provider.
	</p>

	<h4>What about children's privacy?</h4>

	<p>
		
		We respect children's privacy. We do not knowingly or intentionally collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information to us, and rely on a parent or guardian to assist you. Children under the age of 13 are allowed to upload graphics and images and to order products with their parent's consent. To order products, the child must indicate his or her age, submit his or her name and his or her mailing address and shipping address if different from the mailing address together with a valid credit card number. In addition, in order to generate custom postage, we must collect and record the following information: the date and time of the custom postage order, a unique order i.d., the amount of postage ordered in the transaction, and the zip code of the recipient of the custom postage. This is the only information collected from a child.
	</p>

	<p>
		This information is used to fulfill the requested order; confirm shipment; complete record keeping including royalty entitlements and other earnings, if any, to report the sale of Zazzle Custom Stamps to the United States Postal Service, and to advise the child concerning new Zazzle products, services or policies.
	</p>

	<p>
		Parents of children under the age of 13 have the option to consent to the collection of this information from their children or not. Such consent will not be used as consent for the dissemination of any of this information and the information will not be released by Zazzle to third parties without the parents' consent except as may be required by law or upon court order. Personal information at Zazzle is kept confidential and is disclosed only with the consent of the Zazzle user or as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We do not engage in the selling of information regarding the habits, behavior, buying patterns, or demographic information of our users. Zazzle does not condition a child's participation in any on-line activity on the granting of any unnecessary information beyond that actually needed in connection with that activity. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Parents can review any information Zazzle has received from a child and the parent can have that information deleted and the parent can forbid the collection of additional information from their child. If you want to review any information obtained from your child or if you want to have any information obtained from your child deleted from Zazzle's records or to forbid any use of such information, you may send a request to Zazzle Customer Support. Contact us by sending an email with 'Parental Notification' in the subject line. Alternatively, you may contact the Zazzle Child Privacy Representative by phone, email, or letter at:
