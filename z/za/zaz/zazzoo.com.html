Parents of Minors who wish to terminate or cancel their Minor's use of all or any portion of our Services or modify any selections the Minor may have made, must use their Minor's User ID to gain direct access to the Minor's preferences and selected options and information on the Service and follow the instructions that will allow a parent to edit, change, update and/or delete the Minor's Personal Information or alternatively, a parent must notify us by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@zazzoo.com" class="link11blackbold">info@zazzoo.com</a> and provide verifiable identification that they are the parent of the ineligible Minor before making any changes to or terminations of the Minor's registration. We will not allow direct access to any Personal Information by any person without the Registered User's ID or, if applicable, appropriate identification. If a parent does not have his or her Minor's User ID, the parent will be required to send an email to the <a href="mailto:info@zazzoo.com" class="link11blackbold">info@zazzoo.com</a> that includes the parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the Minor's name and wireless or mobile device number or email address as shown in our records, as a user, Registered User or otherwise. We will send a confirming email to the parent via the wireless or mobile device number or email address provided by the parent to verify the parent wishes to terminate his or her Minor's registration. The parent must confirm by sending a reply to the return address designated by us. We will then terminate the Minor's account and registration as requested by the parent and will notify the Minor of the termination request email, identifying the name, address and contact information submitted by the parent, legal guardian or other authorized person who made the request. 
<br><br>
We reserve the right to deny, suspend, deactivate, terminate and/or cancel any registration, status as a Registered User and/or the use of or access to any or all of our Services and any other services, content, activities, features or functions, if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to use or access any portion of our Service, to use or access any information or to use a User ID.
