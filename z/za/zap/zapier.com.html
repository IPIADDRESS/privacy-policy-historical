      <h2>Plain-English Policy</h2>

      <p>We last updated this policy January 11, 2013.</p>

      <p>Welcome to Zapier! Here on the left you'll find our plain-english privacy policy and the corresponding legal policy on the right.</p>

    </english>

    <legal>
      <h2>Legal Policy</h2>

      <p>Date of Last Revision: January 11, 2013</p>

      <p>Welcome to the web site (the "Site") of Zapier, Inc. ( "Zapier", "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by Zapier and has been created to provide information about our company and its content and data linking platform and related services (together with the Site, the "Service(s)") to our Service visitors ("you", "your"). This Privacy Policy sets forth Zapier's policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data ("Personal Data") and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.</p>

    </legal>
  </section>

  <section>
    <english>
      <h2>Third-Party Service Integration</h2>
      <p>To use Zapier, we need to store credentials for third-party services (Gmail, Basecamp, etc). We store credentials encrypted in our database. They are only used to access data you tell us to. We log certain non-identifiable information to provide support and fix problems.</p>
    </english>
     
    <legal>

        <p>Our Service allows you to integrate and create commands for various online third-party services ("Third-Party Services"). In order to take advantage of this feature, you may need to authenticate, register for or log into Third-Party Services through the Service or on the websites of their respective providers. When you enable linking between or log in to Third-Party Services through the Service, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Third-Party Service and your data and content contained within that Third-Party Service ("Login Credentials").  We store your Login Credentials long enough to enable linking to the Third-Party Service.</p>

        <p>When you enable the Service to link content and data between Third-Party Services, the Third-Party Services will provide us with access to certain information that you may have provided to the Third-Party Services, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the rules you set to govern the linking. However, please remember that the manner in which Third-Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such Third-Party Services, and Zapier shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third-Party Services that may be enabled within the Service.</p>

        <p>We may retain certain personally non-identifiable information related to the data or content linked between Third-Party Services (for example, date sent, link configuration, names of the Third-Party Services), for the purpose of improving our Services and as described below in the "Non-Identifiable Data" section.</p>

    </legal>
  </section>

    <english>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We ask for certain information like your name, email address, timezone, and account credentials to use Zapier. We use this information to run Zapier and other things mentioned in this Privacy policy (like logging and analytics).</p>
      <p>For your convienence, we use cookies so you don't have to log in every time you visit our website.</p>

    </english>
     
    <legal>

      <p>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>

        <indent><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services</strong>: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Zapier Services or use certain Zapier Services. Wherever Zapier collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</indent>

      <p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Zapier and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</p>
        
        <indent><strong>Cookies</strong>: In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Services. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services's features.</indent>

        <indent><strong>Aggregated Personal Data</strong>: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Zapier Services, Zapier often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Zapier may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Zapier may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</indent>

    </legal>
  </section>

  <section>
    <english>
      <h2>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h2>
      <p>Primarily, we use personal data to run Zapier. We may use personal data to provide you with predictions about other services you might be interested in on Zapier. If we intend to use your personal data in a way we have not mentioned, we will let you know when we collect that information.</p>
      <p>Sometimes we aggregate user data anonymously to understand our customer base better.</p>

    </english>
     
    <legal>

      <p>Zapier uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Zapier Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Zapier and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Zapier Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Zapier Services. Zapier and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>

      <p>If Zapier intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p>

    </legal>
  </section>

  <section>
    <english>
      <h2>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h2>
      <p>We don't sell your personal data. If we work with partners or contractors, they may have limited access to your personal data but only so much to do their job.</p>
      <p>If we sell the company, personal data may be included in the transfer.</p>

    </english>
     
    <legal>

      <p>You can visit the Services without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain Zapier Services.</p>

      <p>Zapier is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>

        <indent><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</indent>

        <indent><strong>Related Companies</strong>: We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</indent>

        <indent><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties</strong>: Zapier, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</indent>

        <indent><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: Zapier may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Zapier, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</indent>

    </legal>

      <h2>Exclusions</h2>
      <p>This privacy policy only applies to private information we collect. If you post information in a public place, like our support forums, this is public information and can be shared and reproduced.</p>

    <legal>

      <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Zapier other than Personal Data collected through the Services.

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>You must be 13 years old to use Zapier.</p>

    </english>
     
    <legal>

      <p>Zapier does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Zapier through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>

    </legal>
  </section>

  <section>
    <english>
      <h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
      <p>We link to a lot of third-party websites. Our privacy policy only governs our own website.</p>

    </english>
     
    <legal>

      <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Zapier (the "Third-Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third-Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that Zapier endorses or has reviewed the Third-Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p> 

    </legal>
  </section>

  <section>
    <english>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We take many steps to ensure your private information and account credentials are safe, including encryption and two-factor authenciation. To this end, if you find a security problem, <a href="mailto:contact@zapier.com">contact us</a> and we will fix it immediately. Keep in mind, emails and communications with us are not encrypted.</p>

    </english>
     
    <legal>

      <p>Zapier takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Zapier via the Internet.</p>

If we do this, we will post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised.
