information you may provide while using the ZappClassifieds.com Web site (the "Web 
Site"). It is always your choice whether or not to provide personal information 
through the Web site. Any personal information you provide will be treated with 
care, and subject to this Policy will not be used or disclosed in ways to which

information of individual users. ZappClassifieds<br>
