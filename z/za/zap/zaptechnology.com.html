<p><span class="a_Heading_1"></span>This document declares the undertakings by ZAP Technology in relation to its handling of your personal information. </p>
<p><span class="a_Heading_3">Data Collection</span></p>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to collect your personal information by means that are: </p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">fair</span> 
</li><li><span class="Normal">legal; and </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">transparent. </span></li></ul>
<p><strong>If you visit ZAP Technology's web-site,</strong> your web-browser automatically discloses, and ZAP Technology's web-server automatically logs, the following information: the date and time, the IP address from which you issued the request, the type of browser and operating system you are using, the URL of any page that referred you to the page, the URL you requested, and whether your request was successful. This data may or may not be sufficient to identify you.</p>
<p><strong>Any additional data that you provide, e.g. in a web-form</strong>, may also be logged. This data may or may not be sufficient to identify you. </p>
<p><strong>A</strong><strong>ny additional data that your web-browser automatically provides</strong> may also be logged. This will be the case, for example, if your browser has previously been requested to store data on your computer in <strong>'cookies'</strong> and submits them each time you request a web-page within a particular domain (such as <a href="http://www.zaptechnology.com/">www.zaptechnology.com</a>). This data may or may not be sufficient to identify you. </p>
<p><strong>If you disclose personal data to ZAP Technology in conjunction with an identifier such as your name or your credit-card details</strong>, ZAP Technology will collect your personal information. Moreover, any data that becomes available to ZAP Technology through any of the means described in the preceding paragraphs may be able to be associated with that identifier, and hence become your personal information.</p>
<p>Subject to the qualifications immediately below, ZAP Technology undertakes to collect your personal information from you and not from other parties. This undertaking is qualified as follows: </p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">where ZAP Technology reasonably considers that the protection of its financial interests requires that it gather your personal information from other sources, or from additional sources. This applies in particular where ZAP Technology has a lending exposure to you, and seeks information about your creditworthiness; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">where ZAP Technology reasonably considers that its capability to deliver quality services to you will be materially enhanced by gathering your personal information from other sources. This applies in particular to consumer profile data. </span></li></ul>
<p><strong>Where ZAP Technology collects your personal information from sources other than you</strong>, it undertakes:</p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">&nbsp;to do so only by legal means; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">&nbsp;to do so only with your Consent; and </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">&nbsp;to declare to you what sources it uses, and under what circumstances. </span></li></ul>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to declare the <strong>purpose of collection</strong> in a manner which is clear and meaningful, and to avoid vague, highly inclusive statements such as 'to support our operations'. </p>
<p><span class="a_Heading_3">Data Security </span></p>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to <strong>store</strong> your personal information in a manner that ensures security against unauthorised access, alteration or deletion, at a level commensurate with its sensitivity. </p>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to store your personal information only in <strong>jurisdictions</strong> where data protections are at least equivalent to those required under the OECD Guidelines. </p>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to <strong>transmit</strong> your personal information in a manner that ensures security against unauthorised access, alteration or deletion, at a level commensurate with its sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to implement appropriate <strong>measures to ensure security of your personal information against inappropriate behaviour by ZAP Technology's staff-members and contractors.</strong> These include: </p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">training for staff in relation to privacy; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">access control, to limit access to your personal information to those staff and contractors who have legitimate reasons to access it; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">particularly in the case of sensitive data, audit trails of accesses, including the identities of staff and contractors accessing the data; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">reminders to staff and contractors from time to time about the importance of data privacy, and the consequences of inappropriate behaviour;&nbsp; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">declaration of appropriately strong sanctions that are to be applied in the event of inappropriate behaviour&nbsp; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">clear communication of policies and sanctions; and&nbsp;processes to audit, to investigate and to impose sanctions. </span></li></ul>
<p><span class="a_Heading_3">Data Use </span></p>
<p><span class="a_Heading_3"></span>Use refers to the application of your personal information by any part of ZAP Technology, or any staff-member or contractor of ZAP Technology in the course of their work. </p>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to use your personal information only for: </p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal"><span><strong>the purposes for which it was collected;</strong>&nbsp;</span> </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">such other purposes as are <strong>subsequently agreed</strong> between ZAP Technology and You;&nbsp; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">such additional purposes as may be <strong>required by law</strong>. In these circumstances, ZAP Technology will take any reasonable steps available to it to communicate to You that the use has occurred, unless it is precluded from doing so by law;&nbsp; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">such additional purposes as are <strong>authorised by law</strong> (in particular to protect ZAP Technology's interests, e.g. if it believes on reasonable grounds that You have failed to fulfil your undertakings to ZAP Technology or have committed a breach of the criminal law).; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">marketing, sales, service and support purposes; and </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">improving the quality of our web site and services.&nbsp; Comments or materials sent to us, including feedback data, such as suggestions, questions, comments, and any other responses are deemed to be non-confidential. We have no obligation with respect to such responses, and ZAP Technology Pty Ltd shall be free to use, distribute, reproduce, and publicly display such comments and materials without reference to you personally. ZAP Technology Pty Ltd is also free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in such responses for any purpose whatsoever to better your overall experience.</span></li></ul>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to use your personal information only if it has <strong>demonstrable relevance</strong> to the particular use to which it is being put. </p>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to use your personal information in such a manner as to take into account the possibility that it is not of <strong>sufficient quality for the purpose</strong>, e.g. because it is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, or out-of-context.</p>
<p><span class="a_Heading_3">Data Disclosure </span></p>
<p>Disclosure refers to making your personal information available to any party other than ZAP Technology and You. The term disclosure may include many different conditions of data transfer, including selling, renting, trading, sharing and giving. </p>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to disclose your personal information only under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal"><strong>in the course of business being conducted between You and ZAP Technology</strong>, where disclosure is necessary to a contractor, such as a transport company. Where your personal information is disclosed in this way, ZAP Technology undertakes to exercise control over ZAP Technology's contractors to ensure that their actions are compliant with these Terms; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal"><strong>in other circumstances that are directly implied by the purpose agreed between You and ZAP Technology</strong> at the time of data collection or subsequently. Where your personal information is disclosed in this way, ZAP Technology undertakes to exercise control over ZAP Technology's contractors to ensure that their actions are compliant with these Terms; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal"><strong>with your consent</strong>, or at your request; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal"><strong>where required by law</strong>, such as a provision of a statute, or a court order such as a search warrant or sub poena. In these circumstances, ZAP Technology will take any reasonable steps available to it to communicate to You that the disclosure has occurred, unless it is precluded from doing so by law; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal"><strong>where permitted by law</strong> (e.g. the reporting of suspected breach of the criminal law to a law enforcement agency; and in an emergency, where ZAP Technology believes on reasonable grounds that the disclosure of your personal information will materially assist in the protection of the life of health of some person), provided that ZAP Technology will apply due diligence to ensure that the exercise of the permission is justifiable. </span></li></ul>
<p>In all cases, ZAP Technology undertakes to disclose only such of your personal information as is necessary in the particular circumstances. </p>
<p><span class="a_Heading_3">Data Retention and Destruction</span> </p>
<p>Subject to the qualifications immediately below, ZAP Technology undertakes: </p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">to <strong>retain</strong> your personal information only as long as is consistent with its purpose; and </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">to <strong>destroy</strong> your personal information when its purpose has expired, and to do so in such a manner that your personal information is not subsequently capable of being recovered. </span></li></ul>
<p>This undertaking is qualified as follows: </p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">your personal information may be retained in ZAP Technology's <strong>logs, backups and audit trails</strong> within short-term retention cycles that are devised to protect the company's operations. In such cases, your personal information will be destroyed in accordance with those cycles;&nbsp; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">your personal information may be retained beyond the expiry of its purpose if that is <strong>required by law,</strong> such as a provision of a statute, or a court order such as a search warrant or sub poena, or a warning by a law enforcement agency that delivery of a court order is imminent. In these circumstances, ZAP Technology: 
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">will take any reasonable steps available to it to communicate to You that Your Data is being retained, unless it is precluded from doing so by law; and </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">will only retain your personal information while that provision is current, and will then destroy your personal information; </span></li></ul></span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">your personal information may be retained beyond the expiry of its purpose if it is <strong>authorised by law</strong> (in particular to protect ZAP Technology's interests, e.g. if it believes on reasonable grounds that You have failed to fulfil your undertakings to ZAP Technology or have committed a breach of the criminal law). In these circumstances, ZAP Technology will only retain your personal information while that situation is current, and will then destroy your personal information. </span></li></ul>
<p><span class="a_Heading_3">Access by You to Your Personal Data</span></p>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to provide you with <strong>access</strong> to your personal information, subject to only such conditions and processes as are reasonable in the circumstances. In particular, ZAP Technology undertakes to enable access: </p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">conveniently; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">without unreasonable delay; and </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">without cost.</span></li></ul>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to establish and operate <strong>identity authentication protections for access to your personal information</strong> that are appropriate to its sensitivity, but practical. This may involve some inconvenience; for example, relatively straightforward procedures may be involved in order to provide you with access through a channel that you have previously registered with ZAP Technology (such as a particular email-address), but may impose more onerous procedures if you wish to use some other channel. </p>
<p>In the event that you dispute some aspect of your personal information, ZAP Technology undertakes to take reasonable steps in relation to the <strong>amendment, supplementation</strong> or deletion of Your Data.</p>
<p>You undertake: </p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">not to seek access for frivolous purposes, or unreasonably frequently; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">to accept that deletion of some data may not be consistent with the provision of particular services by ZAP Technology to you. </span></li></ul>
<p><span class="a_Heading_3">Information about Data-Handling Practices </span></p>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to make information available to you about the manner in which ZAP Technology handles your data:</p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">in general terms, in a readily accessible manner; and </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">in more specific terms, on request. </span></li></ul>
<p>Where your personal information is disclosed to a contractor, ZAP Technology undertakes to make information available to you on request about the manner in which ZAP Technology's contractors handle your data. </p>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes to ensure that the information provided is meaningful, and addresses your concerns. </p>
<p>You undertake: </p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">not to seek such information for frivolous purposes, or unreasonably frequently; and&nbsp; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">to accept that the disclosure of excessive detail may harm the security of your personal information and ZAP Technology's business processes, and may harm ZAP Technology's commercial interests. </span></li></ul>
<p><span class="a_Heading_3">Handling of Enquiries, General Concerns and Complaints </span></p>
<p>If you have enquiries, general concerns, or complaints about these Terms, or about ZAP Technology's behaviour in relation to these Terms, you undertake: </p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">to <strong>communicate them in the first instance</strong>: 
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">to ZAP Technology only; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">in sufficient detail; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">through a channel made available by ZAP Technology for that purpose.</span></li></ul></span></li></ul>
<p>ZAP Technology undertakes: </p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">to provide one or more channels for communications to ZAP Technology, which are convenient to users;&nbsp; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">to promptly provide acknowledgement of the receipt of communications, including the provision of a copy of the communication, the date and time it was registered, and ZAP Technology's reference-code for the communication; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">to promptly provide a response to the communication, in an appropriate and meaningful manner. </span></li></ul>
<p>You further undertake to not pursue ZAP Technology through any Regulator or the media: </p>
<ul class="a_Bullet_3_Pointer">
<li><span class="Normal">until and unless ZAP Technology has had a reasonable opportunity to respond to the initial communication; and&nbsp; </span>
</li><li><span class="Normal">while ZAP Technology and you remain are conducting a meaningful dialogue about the matter. </span></li></ul>
<p><span class="a_Heading_3">Enforcement</span></p>
<p>ZAP Technology declares that its undertakings in these Terms are intended to create <strong>legal obligations,</strong> and that those obligations are intended to be <strong>enforceable</strong> under appropriate laws in appropriate jurisdictions. These include laws relating to data protection, privacy, fair trading, corporations and criminal laws. </p>
<p>You undertake to seek enforcement only in a <strong>jurisdiction</strong> that is relevant to the transactions that have taken place between You and ZAP Technology, in particular the jurisdiction in which you live or in which you performed the relevant acts, and the jurisdiction in which ZAP Technology is domiciled or performed the relevant acts. </p>
