<h2>Zap Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>This document declares the undertakings by Zap   Technology in relation to its handling of your personal information. </p>
  <h3>Data Collection</h3>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to collect your personal information by means that   are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>fair </li>
    <li>legal; and </li>
    <li>transparent. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you visit Zap Technology's web-site, your web-browser   automatically discloses, and Zap Technology's web-server automatically logs, the   following information: the date and time, the IP address from which you issued   the request, the type of browser and operating system you are using, the URL of   any page that referred you to the page, the URL you requested, and whether your   request was successful. This data may or may not be sufficient to identify   you.</p>
  <p>Any additional data that you provide, e.g. in a web-form,   may also be logged. This data may or may not be sufficient to identify you. </p>
  <p>Any additional data that your web-browser   automatically provides may also be logged. This will be the case, for   example, if your browser has previously been requested to store data on your   computer in 'cookies' and submits them each time you request a   web-page within a particular domain (such as <a href="http://www.zaptechnology.com/">www.zaptechnology.com</a>). This data may   or may not be sufficient to identify you. </p>
  <p>If you disclose personal data to Zap Technology in conjunction with   an identifier such as your name or your credit-card details, Zap   Technology will collect your personal information. Moreover, any data that   becomes available to Zap Technology through any of the means described in the   preceding paragraphs may be able to be associated with that identifier, and   hence become your personal information.</p>
  <p>Subject to the qualifications immediately below, Zap Technology undertakes to   collect your personal information from you and not from other parties. This   undertaking is qualified as follows: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>where Zap Technology reasonably considers that the   protection of its financial interests requires that it gather your personal   information from other sources, or from additional sources. This applies in   particular where Zap Technology has a lending exposure to you, and seeks   information about your creditworthiness; </li>
    <li>where Zap Technology reasonably considers that its   capability to deliver quality services to you will be materially enhanced by   gathering your personal information from other sources. This applies in   particular to consumer profile data. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Where Zap Technology collects your personal information from sources   other than you, it undertakes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;to do so only by legal means; </li>
    <li>&nbsp;to declare to you what sources it uses, and under what   circumstances. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to declare the purpose of   collection in a manner which is clear and meaningful, and to avoid   vague, highly inclusive statements such as 'to support our operations'. </p>
  <h3>Data Security </h3>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to store your personal information   in a manner that ensures security against unauthorised access, alteration or   deletion, at a level commensurate with its sensitivity. </p>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to store your personal information only in   jurisdictions where data protections are at least equivalent to   those required under the OECD Guidelines. </p>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to transmit your personal   information in a manner that ensures security against unauthorised access,   alteration or deletion, at a level commensurate with its sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to implement appropriate measures to ensure   security of your personal information against inappropriate behaviour by Zap   Technology's staff-members and contractors. These include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>training for staff in relation to privacy; </li>
    <li>access control, to limit access to your personal   information to those staff and contractors who have legitimate reasons to access   it; </li>
    <li>particularly in the case of sensitive data, audit trails   of accesses, including the identities of staff and contractors accessing the   data; </li>
    <li>reminders to staff and contractors from time to time   about the importance of data privacy, and the consequences of inappropriate   behaviour;&nbsp; </li>
    <li>declaration of appropriately strong sanctions that are to   be applied in the event of inappropriate behaviour&nbsp; </li>
    <li>clear communication of policies and sanctions;   and&nbsp;processes to audit, to investigate and to impose sanctions. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Data Use </h3>
  <p>Use refers to the application of your personal   information by any part of Zap Technology, or any staff-member or contractor of   Zap Technology in the course of their work. </p>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to use your personal information only for: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the purposes for which it was   collected;&nbsp; </li>
    <li>such other purposes as are subsequently   agreed between Zap Technology and You;&nbsp; </li>
    <li>such additional purposes as may be required by   law. In these circumstances, Zap Technology will take any reasonable   steps available to it to communicate to You that the use has occurred, unless it   is precluded from doing so by law;&nbsp; </li>
    <li>such additional purposes as are authorised by   law (in particular to protect Zap Technology's interests, e.g. if it   believes on reasonable grounds that You have failed to fulfil your undertakings   to Zap Technology or have committed a breach of the criminal law).; </li>
    <li>marketing, sales, service and support purposes; and </li>
    <li>improving the quality of our web site and services.&nbsp;   Comments or materials sent to us, including feedback data, such as suggestions,   questions, comments, and any other responses are deemed to be non-confidential.   We have no obligation with respect to such responses, and Zap Technology Pty Ltd   shall be free to use, distribute, reproduce, and publicly display such comments   and materials without reference to you personally. Zap Technology Pty Ltd is   also free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in such   responses for any purpose whatsoever to better your overall   experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to use your personal information only if it has   demonstrable relevance to the particular use to which it is   being put. </p>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to use your personal information in such a manner   as to take into account the possibility that it is not of sufficient   quality for the purpose, e.g. because it is inaccurate, out-of-date,   incomplete, or out-of-context.</p>
  <h3>Data Disclosure </h3>
  <p>Disclosure refers to making your personal information available to any party   other than Zap Technology and You. The term disclosure may include many   different conditions of data transfer, including selling, renting, trading,   sharing and giving. </p>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to disclose your personal information only under   the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>in the course of business being conducted between   You and Zap Technology, where disclosure is necessary to a contractor,   such as a transport company. Where your personal information is disclosed in   this way, Zap Technology undertakes to exercise control over Zap Technology's   contractors to ensure that their actions are compliant with these Terms; </li>
    <li>in other circumstances that are directly implied   by the purpose agreed between You and Zap Technology at the time of   data collection or subsequently. Where your personal information is disclosed in   this way, Zap Technology undertakes to exercise control over Zap Technology's   contractors to ensure that their actions are compliant with these Terms; </li>
    <li>with your consent, or at your request; </li>
    <li>where required by law, such as a   provision of a statute, or a court order such as a search warrant or sub poena.   In these circumstances, Zap Technology will take any reasonable steps available   to it to communicate to You that the disclosure has occurred, unless it is   precluded from doing so by law; </li>
    <li>where permitted by law (e.g. the   reporting of suspected breach of the criminal law to a law enforcement agency;   and in an emergency, where Zap Technology believes on reasonable grounds that   the disclosure of your personal information will materially assist in the   protection of the life of health of some person), provided that Zap Technology   will apply due diligence to ensure that the exercise of the permission is   justifiable. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In all cases, Zap Technology undertakes to disclose only such of your   personal information as is necessary in the particular circumstances. </p>
  <h3>Data Retention and Destruction </h3>
  <p>Subject to the qualifications immediately below, Zap Technology undertakes: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to retain your personal information only   as long as is consistent with its purpose; and </li>
    <li>to destroy your personal information   when its purpose has expired, and to do so in such a manner that your personal   information is not subsequently capable of being recovered. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This undertaking is qualified as follows: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>your personal information may be retained in Zap   Technology's logs, backups and audit trails within short-term   retention cycles that are devised to protect the company's operations. In such   cases, your personal information will be destroyed in accordance with those   cycles;&nbsp; </li>
    <li>your personal information may be retained beyond the   expiry of its purpose if that is required by law, such as a   provision of a statute, or a court order such as a search warrant or sub poena,   or a warning by a law enforcement agency that delivery of a court order is   imminent. In these circumstances, Zap Technology:
      <ul>
          <li>will take any reasonable steps available to it to   communicate to You that Your Data is being retained, unless it is precluded from   doing so by law; and </li>
        <li>will only retain your personal information while that   provision is current, and will then destroy your personal information; </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>your personal information may be retained beyond the   expiry of its purpose if it is authorised by law (in particular   to protect Zap Technology's interests, e.g. if it believes on reasonable grounds   that You have failed to fulfil your undertakings to Zap Technology or have   committed a breach of the criminal law). In these circumstances, Zap Technology   will only retain your personal information while that situation is current, and   will then destroy your personal information. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Access by You to Your Personal Data</h3>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to provide you with access to your   personal information, subject to only such conditions and processes as are   reasonable in the circumstances. In particular, Zap Technology undertakes to   enable access: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>conveniently; </li>
    <li>without unreasonable delay; and </li>
    <li>without cost.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to establish and operate identity   authentication protections for access to your personal information that   are appropriate to its sensitivity, but practical. This may involve some   inconvenience; for example, relatively straightforward procedures may be   involved in order to provide you with access through a channel that you have   previously registered with Zap Technology (such as a particular email-address),   but may impose more onerous procedures if you wish to use some other channel. </p>
  <p>In the event that you dispute some aspect of your personal information, Zap   Technology undertakes to take reasonable steps in relation to the   amendment, supplementation or deletion of Your Data.</p>
  <p>You undertake: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>not to seek access for frivolous purposes, or   unreasonably frequently; </li>
    <li>to accept that deletion of some data may not be   consistent with the provision of particular services by Zap Technology to you. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Information about Data-Handling Practices </h3>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to make information available to you about the   manner in which Zap Technology handles your data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>in general terms, in a readily accessible manner; and </li>
    <li>in more specific terms, on request. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Where your personal information is disclosed to a contractor, Zap Technology   undertakes to make information available to you on request about the manner in   which Zap Technology's contractors handle your data. </p>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes to ensure that the information provided is   meaningful, and addresses your concerns. </p>
  <p>You undertake: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>not to seek such information for frivolous purposes, or   unreasonably frequently; and&nbsp; </li>
    <li>to accept that the disclosure of excessive detail may   harm the security of your personal information and Zap Technology's business   processes, and may harm Zap Technology's commercial interests. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Handling of Enquiries, General Concerns and   Complaints </h3>
  <p>If you have enquiries, general concerns, or complaints about these Terms, or   about Zap Technology's behaviour in relation to these Terms, you undertake: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to communicate them in the first   instance:
      <ul>
          <li>to Zap Technology only; </li>
        <li>in sufficient detail; </li>
        <li>through a channel made available by Zap Technology for   that purpose.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to provide one or more channels for communications to Zap   Technology, which are convenient to users;&nbsp; </li>
    <li>to promptly provide acknowledgement of the receipt of   communications, including the provision of a copy of the communication, the date   and time it was registered, and Zap Technology's reference-code for the   communication; </li>
    <li>to promptly provide a response to the communication, in   an appropriate and meaningful manner. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You further undertake to not pursue Zap Technology through any Regulator or   the media: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>until and unless Zap Technology has had a reasonable   opportunity to respond to the initial communication; and&nbsp; </li>
    <li>while Zap Technology and you remain are conducting a   meaningful dialogue about the matter. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Enforcement</h3>
  <p>Zap Technology declares that its undertakings in these Terms are intended to   create legal obligations, and that those obligations are   intended to be enforceable under appropriate laws in   appropriate jurisdictions. These include laws relating to data protection,   privacy, fair trading, corporations and criminal laws. </p>
  <p>You undertake to seek enforcement only in a jurisdiction   that is relevant to the transactions that have taken place between You and Zap   Technology, in particular the jurisdiction in which you live or in which you   performed the relevant acts, and the jurisdiction in which Zap Technology is   domiciled or performed the relevant acts. </p>
  <p>Changes to These Privacy Undertakings</p>
  <p>Zap Technology undertakes: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>not to materially change these Terms in a manner that   reduces the protections for your personal information;&nbsp; </li>
    <li>to take all possible steps to prevent any company that   acquires this company or any of its relevant assets from materially changing the   Terms applicable to your personal information in a manner that reduces the   protections for your personal information;&nbsp; </li>
    <li>where it is considering making changes to these Terms, or   creating more specific Terms relating to specific services, to consult with   appropriate representative and advocacy organisations;&nbsp; </li>
    <li>where it makes changes to these Terms, to ensure that the   differences between successive versions are readily accessible;&nbsp; </li>
    <li>to maintain all prior versions of these Terms in such a   manner that they are dated, and readily accessible. </li>
  </ul>
