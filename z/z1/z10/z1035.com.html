advertising. Private individuals often purchase ad time, which necessitates the 
collection of contact information and financial information for proper contract 
maintenance and collection. 3.2) Further, the collection of contact information 
allows the company to follow up with clients to offer future advertising time as 
it becomes available. General Public 3.3) The Radio Business is interactive in 
nature and engages its audience. As a result, listeners will often be invited to

listeners in order to join fan clubs, participate in surveys or contests and to 
provide feed-back. We may use this information to provide listeners with

and the Personal Information is removed from our data-base. 3.6) Occasionally, 
listeners may take offence to an item they heard, or thought they heard, on our
