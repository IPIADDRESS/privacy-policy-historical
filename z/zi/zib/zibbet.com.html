throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or

the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We

systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate
database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure
transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we
cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to
us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional
disclosure. We will protect the transmission of credit card information
through industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.</p>
<h3>IP recognition</h3>
<p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique string of numbers that

privacy policies that differ from ours. This privacy policy only covers
our Site and does not cover any other site. While we make every effort
to keep your information secure, we do not control the policies of
other sites.</p>

letters and special characters, and do not disclose your Zibbet
password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal
information with others, remember that you are responsible for all
actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your

information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your
behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any
reason, you should immediately notify Zibbet and change your password.</p>
