                enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without
                a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure,
                except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information
                is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to
                report suspected illegal activity.</p>

              <p>When you post a message, your Zibbet ID or alias is visible to other
                users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to
                the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in
                return. Zibbet may be required to disclose personally identifiable
                information under special circumstances, such as to comply with
                subpoenas or when your actions violate the Zibbet Terms of Use. Zibbet
                may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in
                compliance with Zibbet’s Copyright Policy, as Zibbet in Zibbet’s sole
                discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an
                investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or
                other unlawful activity.</p>

              <p>Zibbet will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you
                with nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy
                to provide products or services you have requested or when Zibbet has
                your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to
                investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
                suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical
                safety of any person, violations of Zibbet’s Terms of Use, as specified
                in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law. Zibbet will
                transfer information about you if Zibbet is acquired by or merged with
                another company. In this event, Zibbet will notify you by email or by
                putting a prominent notice on the Zibbet web site before information
                about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy
                policy.</p>

              <h4>Cookies</h4>

              <p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an
                anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web
                site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can
                configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or
                notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you will
                not be able to use Zibbet products or services that require you to
                "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of the Zibbet
                service. Zibbet uses its own cookies for a number of purposes including
                to access your information when you "sign in"; keep track of
                preferences you specify while you are using Zibbet’s services; display
                the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your interests and
                activity on Zibbet; estimate and report Zibbet’s total audience size
                and traffic; conduct research to improve Zibbet’s content and services.</p>
              <h4>Third parties</h4>

              <p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this
                document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we
                collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether
                they are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites or other sites
                throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or
                disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Zibbet does not
                control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to
                the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We
                encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal
                information to others.</p>
              <h4>Security</h4>

              <p>We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and
                alteration of the information under our control. These security
                measures include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our
                systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate
                database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure
                transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we
                cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to
                us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional
                disclosure. We will protect the transmission of credit card information
                through industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.</p>
              <h4>IP recognition</h4>

              <p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique string of numbers that
                is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web
                servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We will
                use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to
                administer our Site. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad
                demographic information.</p>
              <h4>Links to other sites</h4>

              <p>Our Site contains hyperlinks and pointers to Internet sites
                maintained by third parties. These links are provided for your
                reference only. We do not control, operate or endorse in any respect
                information, products or services on such third-party sites and are not
                responsible for their content. Many third-party sites have their own
                privacy policies that differ from ours. This privacy policy only covers
                our Site and does not cover any other site. While we make every effort
                to keep your information secure, we do not control the policies of
                other sites.</p>
              <h4>Anti-spam, spoofing regulations</h4>

              <p>As part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another
                Zibbet user's email address, shipping address and/or other information.
                Pursuant to Zibbet’s terms of use agreement, you have a limited license
                to use this information. This information should only be used for
                Zibbet-related communications or for Zibbet-facilitated transactions.
                Zibbet has not granted you a license to use the information for
                unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing,
                without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any
                Zibbet user to your email or physical mail list.</p>
              <h4>Account protection</h4>

              <p>Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers,
                letters and special characters, and do not disclose your Zibbet
                password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal
                information with others, remember that you are responsible for all
                actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your
                password, you may lose substantial control over your personal
                information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your
                behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any
                reason, you should immediately notify Zibbet and change your password.</p>
              <h4>Forums/chat rooms</h4>

              <p>If you use a forum or chat room on this site, you should be aware
                that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be
                read, collected, or used by others, and could be used to send you
                unsolicited messages. Zibbet is not responsible for the personally
                identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
              <h4>Changes to privacy policy</h4>

              <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by
                posting the changes on this page. Please check the revision date at the
                bottom of this page to determine if the policy has been modified since
                you last reviewed it. Your continued use of any portion of our Site
                following posting of the updated Privacy Policy will constitute your
                acceptance of the changes.</p>
