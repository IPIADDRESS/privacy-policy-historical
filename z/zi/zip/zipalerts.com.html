<p>The Service does not respond to Do Not Track <strong>("DNT")</strong> signals on your browser. </p>

<p><strong> Tracking Technologies. </strong>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts are used by us and our third party analytics service to uniquely identify your browser, and enable ZipRecruiter to help you log in faster, enhance your navigation through the Site, convey anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us, help us understand your use of the Service, track users' movements around the Site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. We also may use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. This information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make ZipRecruiter better for our users. </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Log File Information.</span> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. These server logs may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, and other such information. We do not link this automatically collected data to any other information we collect about you. </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Local Storage Objects (FLASH/HTML5).</span> We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML 5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use LSOs such as HTML5 or Flash to collect and store information. </p>

<p>Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please click here: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a></p>

<p>We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Service or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on the Service and other sites in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">clicking here</a> (or if located in the European Union <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">click here</a>). Please note that this does not opt you out of being served generic ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clear Gifs Information.</span> When you use our Service, ZipRecruiter or our third party analytics providers may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously and help us better manage content on our Site by informing us of what content is effective. No personally identifiable information from your ZipRecruiter account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make ZipRecruiter better for our users.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tracking across Third Party Websites.</span> Some third party websites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, certain website browsers allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked. We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. </p>

<h3 id="How We Share">4. How We Share Your Information</h3>


<ol class="pl40">

<li><p><strong>A. Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> We may disclose Personal Information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy:</p></li>

<ul class="bullets pl40">
<li><p>To our subsidiaries and affiliates</p></li>
<li><p>To contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and help provide end services to you. E.g., credit card processing and other billing service providers, background check service providers, customer service providers, insurance brokers and other insurance intermediaries, insurance carriers, underwriting agents, benefits enrollment providers, and email service providers. If we share such information, we will request that such third parties limit the use of such information solely to assist us in providing our Service to you. We may store Personal Information in locations outside the direct control of ZipRecruiter (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). We will require that such hosting providers use industry standard methods to safeguard such Personal Information, but we cannot be responsible for any breaches or unauthorized disclosures by such hosting providers.</p></li>
<li><p>To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets or stock, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by us about our Users is among the assets transferred</p></li>
<li><p>To third parties to market their products or services to you if you have consented to or not opted out of these disclosures</p></li>
<li><p>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. For example, if you give us an e-mail address to use the "e-mail a friend" feature of our Site, we will transmit the contents of that e-mail and your e-mail address to the recipients.</p></li>
<li><p>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information or with your consent</p></li>
<li><p>To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our Service for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful</p></li>
<li><p>To enforce or apply our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> or other online and paper agreements</p></li>
<li><p>If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of ZipRecruiter, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction</p></li>
<li><p>If we believe that such action is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities (including instances where we suspect a User has uploaded to the Service a job posting or other information about a company from a third party website without the permission of the company who originally posted the job posting or other information to such third party website)</p></li>
<li><p>Upon your authorization, the Service may also post information directly to the timeline of your Connected Site Account.</p></li>
<li><p>Any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose for public posting to our Service, such as User Content or customer testimonial, becomes available to the public</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul class="bullets pl40">
<li><p>If a Job Seeker adds a resume to the Resume Database, Employers can search and view such resumes and/or receive communications from us about resumes that may be relevant to their job postings. </p></li>
<li><p>Users of the Service may also be able to view a free preview of information in the Resume Database that contains certain Job Seeker job/education history and other information. You can opt-out of your information being available in our Resume Database at any time by un-checking this preference on the My Profile tab of your Job Seeker account. </p></li>
<li><p>If you respond to a job posting, we will share your response with the Employer that posted the job and/or with the Employer's external Applicant Tracking System or similar external system used by Employer's to manage responses to their job postings. </p></li>
<li><p>If you use the ZipRecruiter HR Service as an existing or prospective Employee, we will share Personal Information you upload to our Service with your prospective or current Employer. </p></li>
<li><p>If an Employer creates an employee directory through the Service, information listed in such directory may viewable by individuals listed in the directory. </p></li>
<li><p>If you use the ZipRecruiter Insurance Service as an Employee, we will share Personal Information to facilitate benefits enrollment and Employer management functionalities. Upon submitting an application for coverage with an insurance company or other qualifying exchange using our Service, we will disclose any information to the required third parties in order to complete the application process.</p></li>
<li><p>From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities <strong>("Events") </strong>on our Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p><strong>B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. </strong>We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data and demographics, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain ZipRecruiter services or to drive product engagement with other Users of the Service.</p>

<p>ZipRecruiter may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on our Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on ZipRecruiter. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. ZipRecruiter does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks ZipRecruiter to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. In addition, third-party advertisers may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, see <a href="http://preferences-mgr.trustee.com">http://preferences-mgr.trustee.com</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google Privacy Center</a> or <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">The NAI Tool to Opt Out of Behavioral Advertising</a>.

<p>The ZipRecruiter Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.</p>

<h3 id="Security">5. SECURITY OF Information</h3>

<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions and sensitive data will be encrypted.</p>

<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you.

<p>You should be aware that when Personally Identifiable Information is voluntarily disclosed (i.e. your name, email address, etc.) in the discussion forums or other public areas on this Site, that information, along with any information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and this Policy does not apply to such information.

<h3 id="Social">8. Social Media (Features) and Widgets</h3>

<p>Our Service includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, and the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Service. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Service, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.

Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing such features.</p>
