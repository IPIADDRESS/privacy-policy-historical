        <h5>Personally Identifiable Information:</h5>

        <p>ZipRecruiter will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information with third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy policy. ZipRecruiter may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you. The types of third parties who we may share your personally identifiable information are credit card processing company, customer service provider, and an email service provider. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy.

        <p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public.

We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.</p>

        <p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. You will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>

        <p>We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service.</p>

        <p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, ZipRecruiter will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/terms">Terms of Use</a>, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ZipRecruiter, our Users or others.</p>

        <h5>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: </h5>

        <p>We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain ZipRecruiter services.</p>

        <p>ZipRecruiter may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on ZipRecruiter. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. ZipRecruiter does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks ZipRecruiter to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. In addition, third-party advertisers may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, see http://preferences-mgr.trustee.com<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google Privacy Center</a> or <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">The NAI Tool to Opt Out of Behavioral Advertising</a>. The ZipRecruiter Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.</p>

       <i class="fa fa-search-plus greenText font45 fl mr15"></i> <p class="mb15">The ZipRecruiter job matching algorithm analyzes millions of jobs from hundreds of job boards to instantly return the most relevant results. Here are some additional tips to help you optimize your search:</p>
<ul class="bullets m0 lightGrayPanel p25">
  <li class="mb10 lh17"><strong>Job titles are best:</strong><br>Searching for a specific job title provides more accurate results than company names or other keywords. <em>software engineer</em> is better than <em>coder</em>, and <em>registered nurse</em> is better than <em>hospital</em>.</li>
  <li class="mb10 lh17"><strong>Zip code can help narrow your location:</strong><br>For location, a zip code is generally more precise than entering city, state.</li>
	<li class="mb10 lh17"><strong>You can use quotes:</strong><br>Surround multiple terms in quotes to treat them as a phrase, like: <em>"program manager" or "dental hygenist".</em></li>
	<li class="mb10 lh17"><strong>You can exclude certain terms:</strong><br>Enter a minus sign before any terms you want to exclude, like: <em>-travel or -"entry level".</em></li>
  <li class="mb0 lh17"><strong>You can require certain terms:</strong><br>Enter a plus sign before any terms you want to require, like: <em>+full-time or +"full benefits".</em></li>
