<p>When you visit our Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets ZipRecruiter help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey anonymous information about how you browse our Service to us. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.

If you respond to a job posting on our Service, we will share your response with the Employer that posted the job.</p>

<p>If you use the ZipHire Service as a Candidate, we will share personal information you upload to our Service during the new hire onboard process with your prospective Employer.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on our Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.</p>

<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings, including those related to our Service. If we sell some or all of our Service, the buyer may need information about users of the Service in order to continue operating our Service in a similar manner as before such transaction. We may transfer personal information to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets related to the Service, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal information about users of our Service is among the assets transferred.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, ZipRecruiter will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/terms">Terms of Use</a>, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ZipRecruiter, our Users or others.</p>

<h5>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</h5>

<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain ZipRecruiter services.</p>

<p>ZipRecruiter may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on our Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on ZipRecruiter. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. ZipRecruiter does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks ZipRecruiter to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. In addition, third-party advertisers may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, see http://preferences-mgr.trustee.com <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google Privacy Center</a> or <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">The NAI Tool to Opt Out of Behavioral Advertising</a>. The ZipRecruiter Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.</p>

       <i class="fa fa-search-plus greenText font45 fl mr15"></i> <p class="mb15">The ZipRecruiter job matching algorithm analyzes millions of jobs from hundreds of job boards to instantly return the most relevant results. Here are some additional tips to help you optimize your search:</p>
<ul class="bullets m0 lightGrayPanel p25">
  <li class="mb10 lh17"><strong>Job titles are best:</strong><br>Searching for a specific job title provides more accurate results than company names or other keywords. <em>software engineer</em> is better than <em>coder</em>, and <em>registered nurse</em> is better than <em>hospital</em>.</li>
  <li class="mb10 lh17"><strong>Zip code can help narrow your location:</strong><br>For location, a zip code is generally more precise than entering city, state.</li>
	<li class="mb10 lh17"><strong>You can use quotes:</strong><br>Surround multiple terms in quotes to treat them as a phrase, like: <em>"program manager" or "dental hygenist".</em></li>
	<li class="mb10 lh17"><strong>You can exclude certain terms:</strong><br>Enter a minus sign before any terms you want to exclude, like: <em>-travel or -"entry level".</em></li>
  <li class="mb0 lh17"><strong>You can require certain terms:</strong><br>Enter a plus sign before any terms you want to require, like: <em>+full-time or +"full benefits".</em></li>
