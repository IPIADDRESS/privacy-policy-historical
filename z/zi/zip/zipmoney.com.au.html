We send a "session cookie" to your computer if and when you log in to your ZIP account by entering your email address and password. We use these cookies to recognise you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times.

Our cookie files are encoded so that your email address and other information can only be interpreted by ZIP. We may, however, share cookie information with certain merchants with whom we have an official co-marketing relationship regarding whether a user identified by the merchant is already registered with ZIP.<br>

For example, if you view a web page created by a third-party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or application.
