<h2>What is personal information?</h2>
<p>
    Personal information means information that identifies you as an individual, or that we can combine with readily available information to identify you as an individual.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>When you visit the Zipcar websites, mobile sites and applications,</strong> our servers automatically log certain information about your use of our websites, mobile sites and applications ("sites") such as your IP address, your browser type, operating system and browser language. We also collect information about your activities on our sites, such as the pages you visit or the ads or links you click on.

Your telephone calls and other communications with us may be recorded or monitored for quality control, training and similar purposes. By using these communication methods you are consenting to the recording or monitoring of your calls and communications with Zipcar.

    <strong>Zipcars may be equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) vehicle tracking technology.</strong> GPS is a network of satellites that allows us to determine the location (latitude and longitude) of Zipcars during your reservation. This information is transmitted to Zipcar and stored (including while it is hired to you). Zipcar uses this information for a variety of important purposes. For example, we may use GPS data to help you find a car you have reserved, to provide roadside assistance when you need it, to assist in making a car available at the place and time you have reserved, to alert us when a Zipcar is likely to be returned late and to locate lost or stolen Zipcars. We do not actively track or monitor vehicle location, and we generally do not store historical GPS data.
