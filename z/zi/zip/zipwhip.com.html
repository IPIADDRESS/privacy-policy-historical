<h1>Zipwhip Privacy Policy</h1>
<!--

<p>Zipwhip's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by Zipwhip anytime you interact with Zipwhip websites, applications, and services (referred to collectively as the "Services" in this document).  Your personal information and privacy is a priority at Zipwhip and we go to great lengths to ensure it is protected both internally at Zipwhip and with any partners or affiliates we do business with.  By using or accessing Zipwhip either directly or through one of our partner or affiliates, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Please take a few moments to read this policy and learn more about the type of information gathered and how we use it.</p>
<p>Zipwhip is actively working to become a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because Zipwhip wants to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy we will be sharing our information practices and having our practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>


<h2>Information Collected and Why</h2>

<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track user movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>This information is gathered for all visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. This allows our server to recognize your computer and any settings you created on our sites. It restores those settings so you don't have to enter the same information every time you visit. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in and keep you logged in until you log out. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID and password to make it easier for you to login when you return to use the Zipwhip service. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
<p>When using Zipwhip you may register and setup your account, send messages, create contacts, and receive messages.  We retain this information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your Contacts. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable any legal audits of that information.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We use personal information about you such as mobile phone number and name to validate your identity and protect other Zipwhip users against spam.</li>
    <li>We ask for you to identify your mobile device because this helps us to build the Zipwhip mobile ecosystem enabling us to offer you future enhanced services.</li>
    <li>Your email address enables us to contact you with Service updates and administrative notices by means other than your mobile device.</li>
    <li>Other information we collect such as your location, birthday, etc. are used so that we can deliver a superior level of customer service and present you with applicable offerings.</li>
    <li>We collect information regarding customer activities on our websites to determine how best to improve our Services.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Zipwhip takes precautions including administrative, technical, and physical measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall.</p>


<h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>

<p>Zipwhip takes your privacy extremely serious. We do not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers.</p>
<p>To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate these guidelines to Zipwhip employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company. We ensure only authorized legal personnel have access to message data.  Other personal information is available for authorized Zipwhip employees for the purpose of troubleshooting support requests.</p>
<p>We make your mobile device type available to other Zipwhip users that have entered your mobile number as a contact. You may set your preferences for sharing your mobile device on the Settings Window.</p>
<p>There are times when it may be advantageous for Zipwhip to make certain personal information about you available to companies that Zipwhip has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Zipwhip to provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with Zipwhip's policies.</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Zipwhip service or using the Zipwhip name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>


<h2>Terms of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h2>

<p>Zipwhip may update its privacy policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated privacy policy. We encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.</p>
