<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> zipRealty collects personally identifiable information from you in order to respond to your requests for our products and services. Depending on the services you request, this personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, zip code, e-mail address, telephone number, and information about the properties in which you are interested. If you are seeking to buy or sell a property with another person, we will collect much of the same information about them as well. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> You will be asked to provide personally identifiable information at various places in our web site, including, but not limited to, the following: </font></p>
<ul>
 <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> <b>Tips &amp; Strategies Newsletter</b>
 - When you request this service, we collect an e-mail address in order to send
 you a newsletter offering tips and suggestions on selling or buying a new
 home. </font></li>
 <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> <b>Getting Started</b> -
 When you register to use our web site, we collect your first and last name,
 e-mail address, preferred phone number, and information on whether you are buying or selling. You will also select a
 Login ID and Password. Your Login ID and Password help ensure that the personally
 identifiable information you provide to us remains secure. Your Password should
 never be shared with anyone.</font></li>
 <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> <b>Mandatory Real Estate
 Agency Disclosure</b> - We collect the date and time you read the disclosure
 statement that we, as licensed Real Estate Agents, are required by state
 law to provide. This protects you by insuring that we are complying with statutory requirements.</font></li>
 <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> <b>Find Your Home</b> -
 In order to help narrow your search for a new home, we collect information
 from you regarding the type of home you want, including, but not limited to:
 price range, number of rooms, square footage, and property type.</font></li>
 <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> <b>House Features</b> - In order to complete the listing agreement, we collect information from
 you including the address, size, features, and condition of the home you are
 selling. We will also collect information that you will need to disclose to
 potential buyers regarding material facts as well as any reports that have
 been prepared for your property. These disclosures are required by law. The
 information is collected to facilitate your compliance with the law.</font></li>
 <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> <b>Purchase Negotiations</b>
 - If you choose to proceed to this step, you will be engaged in a complete
 negotiation for the purchase of a new home. You will need to provide detailed
 information regarding the terms you would like included in your purchase contract.
 This information will include such items as the title and escrow company you
 would like to use, what inspections you will require or waive, what warranties
 you will require or waive, the amount of any deposits you will make, and your
 ability to make such deposits. The information you provide at this stage will
 depend in large part on your decisions after extensive consultation with your
 Online Agent and will be incorporated into a Purchase Sale Contract as required
 by law.</font></li>
 <li><b> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> Preparing
 Your Property -</font></b> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2">
 We collect information from you regarding your initial intentions to maintain or improve the current condition of your property.<font></font></font></li><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"><font>
 <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> <b>Determining
 the Price - </b>We collect information regarding the terms under which you
 wish to offer your property for sale, including but not limited to whether
 the property will be sold in its "As Is" condition, length of escrow,
 allocation of costs, amount, if any, of credits to buyer, the requirement for
 a seller rentback, the possibility of a sale contingent on the buyer selling
 their current home, any personal property included in the sale, and the seller's
 minimum price requested.</font></li>
 <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> <b>Sale Negotiations</b>
 - If you choose to proceed to this step, you will be engaged in a complete
 negotiation for the sale of your home. You will need to provide detailed information
 regarding the terms you would like included in your sale contract. This information
 will include such items as what inspections or warranties you will provide,
 and the amount of any deposits you will require. The information you provide
 at this stage will depend in large part on your decisions after extensive
 consultation with your Online Agent and will be incorporated into a Purchase
 Sale Contract as required by law.</font></li>
 <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> <b>E-mail</b> - Throughout
 your use of the zipRealty web site, you will communicate extensively with
 one of our Online Agents. Your Online Agent will use your e-mail address and
 all of the information you submit in order to provide you with guidance, suggestions
 and service in your efforts to sell your existing
 home or in your search for a new home, </font></li>
 <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> <b>Contact Us</b> - We collect

<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> When you visit zipRealty,
 our computer system, like most, will automatically log some basic information
 about you and your computer, including, but not limited to, your IP address,
 operating system and browser software. We use this information for routine maintenance
 and to gather broad demographic information to help us decide how better to
 implement our web site.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> We use cookies. Cookies
 are used to store a session ID for tracking users as they move through the web
 site after logging on. The cookies are not linked to personally identifiable
 information. If a user does not accept cookies, they will not be able
 to register on our web site or re-log in as a registered user.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> <b><a name="what3"></a>With whom personally identifiable information is shared.</b></font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> We recognize that the information
 we collect from you may, in itself, or when tied together with other information,
 identify you as a specific individual. Your account information and personal
 data is maintained by zipRealty in order to fulfill our legal and regulatory
 requirements and to provide you with the information, products and services
 you have requested. As a general rule, zipRealty will not disclose your
 personal information to any third party except with your permission or under
 special circumstances, as discussed below.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> zipRealty will
 disclose to interested parties information pertaining to the sale of a house
 listed in our database. This information will be posted on our web site and
 in the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS) for the purpose of marketing the
 home to the greatest number of potential buyers.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> By requesting information or services from zipRealty, you give zipRealty permission to transfer your information, as necessary, to the appropriate parties, such as the title insurer, loan underwriter, appraiser, or inspector you select, so that they can fulfill your request and provide you with the services you require. All Online Agents are employees of zipRealty. All personally identifiable information you provide to zipRealty will be made available to your Online Agent. Generally, your Online Agent will coordinate the disclosure of your information to third parties. This will be done in much the same way as a traditional Real Estate Agent shares information with third parties. For example, your Online Agent may disclose your name and the address of the property you want to purchase to a building inspector when you request our assistance in arranging an inspection of the property. Your Online Agent will also share certain information with zipRealty Field Service Agents who will assist you in viewing properties.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> The various lending institutions, title companies and other service providers involved in your real estate transaction may each have their own privacy policies governing how they handle your personally identifiable information. We endeavor to review these other policies in order to ensure that the philosophies and values of our affiliates are in alignment with our own. However, zipRealty accepts no responsibility or liability for third party privacy policies or the actions of any third party with respect to your personally identifiable information. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> zipRealty does conduct research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior based on the information provided by the user and from our server log files. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis only. For example, we may review how many users are women, or the average price range of our users. zipRealty may share this aggregated data with our business affiliates or, if required by law, any government agency. However, we will not sell or lease personally identifying information to any third party.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> If you came to our website through a link on eBay's website ("eBay Referred Users"), zipRealty may provide eBay reasonably requested aggregated and personally identifiable data. zipRealty has also agreed to provide eBay reasonable access to its database of eBay Referred Users in order to support communication with and surveys of the eBay Referred Users.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> zipRealty may disclose
 personally identifiable information in certain circumstances when we have reason
 to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to contact, identify
 or bring legal action against someone who may be intentionally or unintentionally
 causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, our users, or
 anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose personally
 identifiable information when we believe in good faith that the law requires
 it and for administrative or other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain
 and improve our products and services.</font></p>
 <p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> Our web site provides links
 to other web sites. Please be aware that when you click on one of these links,
 you are going to another web site even though the zipRealty logo, banner,

 is being collected by that site, not zipRealty. We encourage you to read
 the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy policy may differ
 from ours.</font></p>
