All Online Agents are employees of zipRealty.com. All personally identifiable information you provide to zipRealty.com will be made available to your Online Agent.  Generally, your Online Agent will coordinate the disclosure of your information to third parties.  This will be done in much the same way as a traditional Real Estate Agent shares information with third parties.  For example, your Online Agent may disclose your name and the address of the property you want to purchase to a building inspector when you request our assistance in arranging an inspection of the property.  Your Online Agent will also share certain information with zipRealty.com Field Service Agents who will assist you in viewing properties.</font></p>
