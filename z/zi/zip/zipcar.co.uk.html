<h2>
    what personal information we collect and how we use it
</h2>
<p>
    The principal purposes for which we collect and store your personal
    information are to process your application, allow you to reserve and use
    our vehicles, authorise payment, bill you, respond to your enquiries,
    improve our products and services and maintain your account with us. We
    will use your personal information including where:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        this is necessary to enter into or perform our contract with you - for
        example, using your contact details and payment details to supply products
        and services you want to purchase.
    </li>
    <li>
        this is necessary to comply with legal or regulatory requirements - for
        example, disclosure of information to law enforcement if you are involved
        in an accident during your reservation, or suffer any loss, damage or theft
        of the vehicle, or if you incur any speeding, parking, toll or other
        traffic-related fines or commit any traffic offences during your
        reservation.
    </li>
    <li>
        this is necessary in the public interest - for example, undertaking
        measures for anti-fraud screening and verifying our member's identities.

<p>
    We have set out below further details on the information we collect, store
    and why we use it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>When you use our Sites,</strong>
    our servers automatically log certain information about your use of our
    Sites, such as your IP address, your browser type, operating system,
    browser language and service provider. We also collect information about
    your activities on our Sites, such as the pages you visit or the ads or
    links you click on. We use this for a number of purposes, where we have a
    legitimate interest to do so, such as: improving our services, developing
    new services based on what we learn from your activity; identifying
    products and marketing that may be of interest to you; personalising our
    service to you; and carrying out statistical analysis and research with the
    purpose of allowing us to better understand our members and the products /
    services they want. We also use this information to provide and adapt our
    services to take account of the technical capabilities of our users as well
    as identify issues with the website and user's experience of it.
</p>
<p>
    <em>IP Addresses and other information collected automatically:</em>
    We may collect your IP address when you visit our websites to help us
    diagnose problems with our systems, for system administration, to report
    aggregated information to our business partners, and to audit the use of
    our website. In select circumstances, we may use IP addresses to help us
    identify you to protect our service, site, users or others. We also collect
    your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,
    the pages viewed on our site, operating system, date/time stamp, and/ or
    clickstream data to analyse trends in the aggregate and administer the
    site.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Session Replay:</em>
    When you visit our website, we may also record information about your
    browsing session on the site, including which pages you visited and any
    forms on the website that you filled in. We review this information to
    identify any technical issues in the operation of our sites and to improve
    the user interface on our sites. If we use a third party to help us with
    this service, this information will be passed to that third party for this
    purpose.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Mobile Analytics:</em>
    When you download and use our apps, we may use mobile analytics software to
    help us better understand the functionality of our app on your mobile
    device. Our analytics may record how often you use the app, how you use the
    app, aggregated usage, performance data and where you downloaded the app
    from.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Mobile GPS and Push Notifications:</em>
If you allow us, when you use our apps we may collect location markers using the GPS in your device. Knowing approximately where you are would help the app provide you better service, such as finding the nearest Zipcar location near you. This would also help us send you push notifications or other communications based on your location (for example, nearby special offers).  We will use push notifications to provide certain services such as emergency or other service notifications, return notifications, providing information about vehicle location, providing details regarding our products and services etc. We will only share this information with third party providers for the purpose of providing you these services. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information. If you change your mind about sharing your location or receiving push notifications from the app, adjust the settings of your mobile device to turn off transmission of geolocation data or to stop transmission of push notifications at any time. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Zipcar collects information that you voluntarily submit to us,
    </strong>
    which could include your name, email address, postal address, telephone
    number, or a picture of you or identifying documents. This also includes
    information in your profile or information you provide to us via an email,
    or similar message, telephone call, or by other means. Your telephone calls
    and other correspondence with us may be recorded or monitored for quality
    control, training and similar purposes. If during a reservation you connect
    or pair your mobile device with the Zipcar vehicle (for instance via
    Bluetooth or USB port), please unpair your device and delete any personal
    data stored on the vehicle's infotainment system. We use this information
    in connection with providing you with our services and managing your
    account as outlined elsewhere in this privacy notice.

            <li>preferred Zipcar pod locations; and</li>
            <li>other information that may be required to provide you a vehicle and/or provide you with services.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
</ul>

<p>
    As part of your application or membership, we may also collect information such as your driving record from
    regulatory bodies or from third parties.
</p>
<p>
    Where you inform us that you require an adapted vehicle or other driver aid
    we will use that information in order to provide you with the service you
    requested where you have given your explicit consent to us using that
    information or: (1) the use is necessary to protect your vital interests in
    an emergency or those of another person; (2) the relevant information has
    been made public by you; (3) the use is necessary or in connection with
    legal claims or court proceedings; or (4) the use is necessary for reasons
    of substantial public interest - for example, driving safety.
</p>
<p>
    In connection with your membership, we will collect where and when you
    searched for, reserved or picked up a vehicle, where and when you returned
    a vehicle, waiver or insurance preferences, fuel consumption, mileage,
    accident history and other information related to a Zipcar vehicle and your
    use of it. This information is required in order to provide you with the
    services you requested under the member contract or for our legitimate
    business interests (for example to monitor the usage of our vehicle fleet).
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes, we will combine the personal information we receive from you
    with other information we received from other sources so we can provide you
    a more customised experience. This information may include your name,
    contact information, reservation details and other information that is
    relevant to your reservation. These third parties include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Universities if you are using an affiliated account;</li>
    <li>Your employer or association if you are using a corporate / association account;</li>
    <li>Our licensees and our affiliates, in order to create a Zipcar membership account or if you are making a
        reservation in one location served by our affiliates or licensees for reservations in another location served by
        us;
        and</li>
    <li>Police and other law enforcement agencies if you are involved in an accident during your reservation, or suffer
        any loss, damage or theft of the vehicle, or if you incur any speeding, parking, toll or other traffic-related
        fines or commit any traffic offences during your reservation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you have an accident, or suffer any loss, theft or damage to the vehicle
    during your reservation or suffer any mechanical failure, we will collect
    information regarding such incident including your report of the incident
    and any police or other third party report including details of those
    involved, together with the nature of any personal injuries and/or damage
    to the vehicle and optional extras. We will use this information to provide
    services to you (for example, under the member contract and/or the terms of
    any optional extra like the damage fee waiver); for our legitimate business
    interests (for example, in recovering the costs of any loss or damage
    caused to the vehicle); for complying with any legal obligation on us (for
    example, making any required notification of the incident to appropriate
    authorities); and establishing, exercising or defending legal claims
    arising as a result of such incident.
</p>
<p>
    We will also collect information about any speeding, parking, toll or other
    traffic-related fines that you incur or any traffic offences that you
    commit during your reservation where these are provided to us by any law
    enforcement agency. We will use this information to deal with such fine or
    offence in accordance with the terms of your member contract with us.
</p>
<p>
    When you call or text us (from any phone), or e-mail us, we may record or
    monitor the communication for quality control, training or similar
    purposes.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the purposes listed above, we use this information to better
    understand our members and may provide you with relevant offers.
</p>
<p>
    Please be aware that, in certain circumstances, where you do not provide
    personal information which is required by us, we will not be able to
    provide the products and services under our contract with you or may not be
    able to comply with a legal obligation on us. For example, when reserving a
    vehicle with us we will require information such as your name, address,
    payment information and driver's license. If you fail to provide this
    information to us we will be unable to provide a vehicle to you. You will
    be made aware if this situation arises and what the consequences of not
    providing the personal information will be.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Automated Decisions</strong>
    may be made by us regarding you in respect of validation of driver licence
    details or other identify checks. If you disagree with the decision you are
    entitled to contest this by contacting us by using the details at the end
    of this privacy notice.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Where permitted by local law, Zipcar may use Global Positioning System
        (GPS), telematics data tracking technology and anti-theft technology
    </strong>
    that uses GPS. GPS is a network of satellites that would allow us to
    determine the location (latitude and longitude) of Zipcars during your
    reservation. Additionally, Zipcars may also have an on-board device that
    may monitor the state of the vehicle from moment to moment, including its
    location during your reservation. This information would be transmitted to
    Zipcar and stored. Where applicable, Zipcar uses this information for a
    variety of legitimate interests and also in connection with the performance
    of our contract with you. For example, we may monitor or store vehicle or
    GPS data to help you find a car you have reserved, to assist with roadside
    assistance and to locate lost or stolen Zipcars.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fraud detection and prevention. </strong>
    It is important that Zipcar takes appropriate measures to detect and
    protect its services against fraud, theft and abuse. We have therefore
    engaged a third-party service provider, Sift Science ("Sift"), based in the
    United States, to assist with these measures.
</p>
<p>
    In connection with such activities, we need to collect and share with Sift
    the following personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests in
    detecting and preventing fraud, theft and abuse:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Contact detail information: such as your email address, postal address,
        telephone number, user log-in information;
    </li>
    <li>
        Site transaction information: such as details of your membership with
        us, including details you may provide such as occupation, ID
        verification details, date of birth and driving licence details, as
        well as details of reservations you make including time, date, location
        and payment details, aggregated reservation details and other
        identifying information about your membership or reservation;
    </li>
    <li>
        Device and browser information: such as details of the device
        identifiers and attributes together with device and phone related
        meta-data; and
    </li>
    <li>
        Site and app usage information: such as your device IP address, your
        location when using the website or app if available and session ID.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We collect this personal data from your interaction with our services
    (through the use of our website or app) and through certain standard
    tracking technologies (e.g., JavaScript snippets).
</p>
<p>
    Sift will process the information referred to above as an independent
    controller separate from Zipcar and only for the purposes of providing its
    fraud detection and prevention services, as further described in its
    privacy notice, available at:
    <a href="https://sift.com/service-privacy">
        https://sift.com/service-privacy
    </a>. Sift is required to comply with certain legal requirements which apply to
    their business. If you have any questions about Sift's use of information
    or if you would like to exercise any data protection right you may have in
    relation to Sift's processing, please contact Sift directly using the
    details provided in Sift's privacy notice available at the link above.
</p>
<p>
    If used, telematics data tracking technology allows us to monitor driver
    behaviour of members to aid in reducing fraud or in an accident situation.
    In addition, at an anonymous and aggregated level, insight can be obtained
    about Zipcar usage. We have a legitimate interest in using the information
    in this way as well as there being a public interest in the responsible use
    of vehicles.
</p>
<p>
    Zipcar may have access to video surveillance systems as well as cameras,
    where indicated by signage at the relevant Zipcar group location, that
    record activity at our Zipcar pods.

    children's privacy
</h2>
<p>
    We do not knowingly solicit or collect individually identifying information
    from children under the age of 16. If you are under 16 years old, you may
    not submit any personal information to us or subscribe for services. If you
    believe we might have any personal information from or about a person under

<h2>
    where we hold personal information
</h2>
<p>
    <em>Reservations</em>
</p>
<p>
    As we offer the ability to reserve vehicles and benefit from our services
    in various locations globally, we may transfer your personal information to
    our affiliates and independent licensees in these locations for the
    purposes of fulfilling your reservation and/or entering into a member
    agreement. The exact location of where your personal data will be
    transferred depends on the location of your reservation.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the countries to which your personal information may be transferred
    for these purposes that are located outside the EU do not benefit from an
    adequacy decision issued by the EU Commission regarding protection afforded
    to personal information in that country. Details of these specific
    countries can be found here:
    <br>
    <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en">

    </a>
</p>
<p>
    These transfers are made either as they are necessary for the performance
    of a contract to which you will be a party, or for pre-contractual
    measures. Alternatively, adequacy of data protection is ensured by standard
    data protection clauses that we have in place with the relevant recipient.
    A copy of these standard data protection clauses may be requested via our
    Data Protection Officer at the address set out in the Contact Information
    section.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Business operations</em>
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the information we collect from you may be transferred to, and
    stored by, IT vendors who operate on our behalf. We also transfer
    information to a number of providers of business applications. These
    providers are primarily located in the United States.
</p>
<p>
    The United States does not benefit from a decision issued by the EU
    Commission regarding protection afforded to personal information. Adequacy
    of data protection is instead ensured by standard data protection clauses
    we have in place with that third party. A copy may be requested via our
    Data Protection Officer at the address set out in the Contact Information
    section.
</p>
<p>
    Given the global nature of our business, we also transfer information
    within the Zipcar group companies as for certain activities the group uses
    shared IT functions. Transfers from within the European Union for these
    purposes are primarily made to the United States, although transfers may be
    made to other countries as well. The United States and many of the other
    countries located outside the European Union do not benefit from an
    adequacy decision issued by the EU Commission regarding protection afforded
    to personal information in that country. Adequacy of data protection is
    instead ensured by standard data protection clauses we have in place with
    the recipient. A copy may be requested via our Data Protection Officer at
    the address set out in the Contact Information section.
</p>
<p>
    Transfers of personal data made to Sift in connection with processing for
    the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud, theft and abuse. The fraud
    detection and prevention details above are made under the EU-US Privacy
    Shield Framework. Sift is certified under this framework. You can learn
    more about this at <a href="http://www.privacyshield.gov">www.privacyshield.gov</a>.
</p>
<h2>
    how long do we keep your information
</h2>
<p>
    We will keep your information for as long as it is reasonably necessary. It
    will depend on factors such as whether you've any reservations upcoming or
    in the past or an account with us or have interacted with recent offers. We
    will also retain your information as necessary to comply with legal,
    accounting or reporting requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The criteria we may use to determine the retention period for certain
    categories of data is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>the length of time that you are a member of Zipcar;</li>
    <li>how frequently you reserve with us or when your most recent reservation occurred;</li>
    <li>whether there are contractual or legal obligations that exist that require us to retain the data for a certain
        period of time;</li>
    <li>whether there is any ongoing legal or financial claim that relates to any reservation you have made with us, or
        that is otherwise related to your relationship with us;</li>
    <li>whether any applicable law, statute, or regulation allows for a specific retention period;</li>
    <li>whether the personal information is considered to be a special category of personal information, in which case a
        shorter retention period generally would be applied; and</li>
    <li>what the expectation for retention was at the time the data was provided to us.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We use cookies and similar technologies as described in this Notice. Where
    you have consented to our use of cookies, you agree that we can distinguish
    you from other users of our website and apps for the purposes set out
    below. This helps provide you with good user experience, tailored content
    and interest-based adverts. For example, we can recognise and remember
    important information that will make it more comfortable for you to browse
    our website or use our apps such as preferred settings. It also helps us to
    detect and prevent fraud.

    <strong>What are Cookies and similar technologies?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store via your
    browser on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device.
</p>
<p>
    There are three main types of cookies:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
            Session cookies: specific to a particular visit and limited to sending
            session identifiers (random numbers generated by the server) so you don't
            have to re-enter information when you navigate to a new page or check out.
            Session cookies are not permanently stored on your device and are deleted
            when the browser closes;
    </li>
    <li>
            Persistent cookies: record information about your preferences and are
            stored in your browser cache or mobile device; and
    </li>
    <li>
            Third party cookies: placed by someone other than us which may gather
            data across multiple websites or sessions.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    We use cookies for the following purposes:

    <strong>Google Analytics</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our websites use the web analytics service Google Analytics that is
    provided by Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA
    94043, USA ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies". Cookies are small
    text files that are placed on your computer which allow analysing how you
    use the platform. The information generated by the cookie on your use of
    the platform will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the
    United States. We have activated the so called "IP-anonymization" which
    means that your IP address will be truncated within the area of the
    European Union or the European Economic Area before being transferred to
    the United States. Only in exceptional cases the entire (ie. non-truncated)
    IP address will be transferred to a Google server in the US and truncated
    there. Google will use this information on our behalf for the purpose of
    evaluating your use of the platform, compiling reports on platform activity
    and providing other services relating to platform and internet usage.
    Google does not provide us with data that we may link back particularly to
    you. Your truncated IP address that is transferred to Google will not be
    associated with any other data held by Google. You may refuse accepting
    cookies by selecting the relevant settings of your browser. However, please
    note that if you do so you may not be able to use the full functionality of
    the platform. You can also opt out from being tracked via Google Analytics
    with effect for the future by downloading and installing Google Analytics
