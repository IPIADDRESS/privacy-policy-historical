<p>A browser cookie ("Cookie") is a small piece of information stored by a web browser that is used to communicate with a web server when the 
browser connects to a web site. A browser Cookie is persistent, which means that once it is placed in your web browser, it will stay there until it is deleted.</p>

<p>In addition to Cookies, we or third party advertisers may also utilize "Pixel Tags" (also know as "1x1 gifs," "clear gifs," or "web beacons.")</p>

<p class="indent">We may use information stored in the Cookie to determine which advertisements may be displayed to you by ZipList. Additionally, 
advertisements displayed to you may be served directly from third parties, and these third parties may place their own Cookies in

<p class="indent">We or other third parties may use Pixel Tags personalize advertisements, track activity and gain a better understand of the 
effectiveness of these ads. Beyond the use of Pixel Tags on the ZipList Service, Pixel Tags may also be placed in email messages sent from us or

can exclude them from being stored in your browser by configuring it to reject Cookies (some browsers may also allow you to be notified to selectively 
accept or reject Cookies on a case-by-case basis). Each web browser has a different method in which to configure its Cookie policy, so refer to the help
