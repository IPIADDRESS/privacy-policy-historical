<h1>ZipList Privacy Policy</h1>
<i>Last updated:  July 29, 2011</i>
<p>
At ZipList, we take your privacy very seriously. To this end, we attempt to collect and store the minimal amount of information necessary
for you to use ZipList, as evidenced by limiting required information to only an email address and password.
</p>
<p>
However, we also understand that you may want specific information on how we collect, use or disclose this or other information provided by you
as part of your use of ZipList. The following represents ZipList’s Privacy Policy, which applies to both visitors and registered users of our Service.
</p>
<p>
By using the ZipList Service, you agree to allow us to collect, use and disclose personal information subject to the terms and conditions
contained in this Privacy Policy, which is included as part of and incorporated in to the ZipList Terms of Use. Accordingly, capitalized terms
in this Privacy Policy are as defined in the ZipList Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time, and if any material changes are made, we will update this Privacy Policy
and provide a notice that it has changed. This notice will be located at the top of the Privacy Policy, and will include the date as to
when it was last modified. As part of the ZipList Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you agree that it is your sole responsibility to
review our Privacy Policy for any changes that may occur. Accordingly, we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy prior to each time
you use the ZipList Service. Any questions regarding our Privacy Policy should be directed to privacy@ziplist.com.
</p>
<h2>Information Collected and Required by ZipList</h2>
<p>As part of your use of the Service, we collect both personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
<p>
When you sign up as a ZipList User, we collect and store minimal personal information in order to create an account which is comprised of your
registered email address and a password (your “Account Information”).  This is the only information required to use ZipList.
</p>
<p>
You may choose to add other personally identifiable information to your Account Information in order to use additional capabilities of the
Service (such as Instant Messaging addresses, mobile phone numbers for SMS Text Messaging, store preferences, etc.), however such additional
information is optional.
</p>
<p>
We collect and store this information in order to authorize your login to the Service, to provide the necessary capabilities of ZipList,
to better understand Users and their usage of ZipList, to contact Users regarding information about ZipList and to improve and make modifications
to ZipList. We also use this information to properly attribute Content uploaded by you, to contact you regarding any questions we may have
regarding this Content, or to attribute any comments or posts that you may Upload to ZipList.
</p>
<p>
We also use your Account Information to validate and activate your initial registration via email, as well as to provide password recovery
should you request it. We may also use your Account Information to periodically provide you with information about our products and services
or other general information we believe you may find valuable.
</p>
<p>
We may also use your Account Information to contact you regarding important information, changes or updates to the Service, and these forms
of communications are mandatory as part of your use of ZipList. In other words, you cannot “opt out” of any important communications related to
your use of the ZipList service.
</p>
<p>
All of your Account Information will be kept private from other Users by default, and will change only if you explicitly decide the share
this information with other ZipList Users.
</p>
<h2>Collection and User of Aggregate Information</h2>
<p>Aggregate information is data we collect about group activity, and does not contain any personally identifiable information. Examples of such Aggregate Information include, but are not limited to, search queries on products, recipes or stores, checklists, types and quantities of items added to Lists, and data on how and when Users access ZipList. We collect this information in order to better understand how Users utilize ZipList with the goal to anticipate future User requirements and identify group trend activity. Understanding this Aggregate Information also allows us and third parties to tailor product and service offers to our Users.</p>
<p>
We may also share Aggregate Information about our Users with third parties for various purposes, such as additional analysis of data for
sales, marketing, performance and usability testing and advertising.
</p>
<h2>How we may disclose or share information</h2>
<p>We will not disclose any information provided by you unless you specifically authorize it or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Disclosure to Related Parties</h2>
<p>
We may disclose your Account Information and other personally identifiable information to any individual, company or entity that is either
controlled or under common control of ZipList (“Related Parties”). Should we disclose this information to Related Parties, it will be provided
under the same terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>Disclosure to Advertisers, Merchants or Vendors</h2>
<p>
Third party advertisers do not have access to any of your Account Information unless you specifically choose to share it with them. If you
choose to respond to an offer for product or services from an advertiser, sales or marketing partner (“Vendor”) of ZipList as part of your use
of the Service, you may be asked to submit additional demographic and other personal information not required by ZipList. With your consent, this
Vendor may also use your Account Information, along with any additional information you may directly provide to the Vendor. We do not collect or
store any additional information that you may provide to a Vendor.
</p>
<h2>Disclosure to other Users or Individuals</h2>
<p>
Should you decide to Upload content and designate it as Public Content, any personally identifiable information provided as part of your
Content will be available to other Users. This Public Content (such as recipes, recommendations, store information, comments on blogs or articles,
etc.) may also appear in the results of searches provided by on Internet search engines. In the event that your account is terminated, it is
possible that your personal information may continue to be displayed in public Internet search results for some time, even after your User account
has been terminated, due to the various indexing policies of different search engines.
</p>
<h2>Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
<p>
Account Information for Users of the ZipList-developed Martha Stewart iPhone App may be shared with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. (MSO),
and their use of this information is governed by
<a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/privacy" target="_blank">MSO's Security and Privacy Policy.</a>
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, ZipList will not share any of your Account Information with third parties unless you give us your permission. However, we may provide non-personally
identifiable information about you in an aggregate form with other User information. For example, we may collect, aggregate and share utilization,
visitors or session times, popular areas or content of the Service, etc.
</p>
<p>
The third parties to which we may provide this information may include advertisers (whether current, past or potential advertisers),
advertising networks or other advertising sales, marketing or technology providers, partners, sponsors, traffic measurement services or other
similar parties.
</p>
<h2>Disclosure for Lawful Reasons</h2>
<p>
We may maintain your Account Information and other personally identifiable information, even in the event of suspension or termination of
your use of ZipList and may disclose this information if required to do so by law as described below.
</p>
<p>
We may also provide access to your Account Information or other personally identifiable information, should we believe in good faith that
we are required to do so in order to comply with legal proceedings or official investigations, including, for example, responding court orders,
search warrants, subpoenas or other legal processes.
</p>
<p>
We may also disclose Account Information or other personally identifiable information when we have a reasonable belief that it is necessary to
contact, identify or bring legal action against a User that we believe that may, in whole or in part, violate the Terms of Use, or that otherwise
might be inappropriate, illegal, offensive, or that may harm, threaten the safety of, or violate the rights of other Users or third parties.
</p>
<h2>Disclosure to Consultants and Contractors</h2>
<p>
We may employ consultants, contractors and other vendors (“Contractors”) to provide various products and services in support of the ZipList
service. Examples include (a) third party email, messaging and communications, (b) site hosting, storage and data backup, (c) development of
application components or features, and (d) sales, marketing and advertising support services. During the normal course of business, these Contractors
may have access to your Account Information and/or other personally identifiable information in order to provide their necessary services to ZipList.
However, Contractors are required to protect the privacy of your information with the same terms of this Privacy Policy, and they are prohibited from
using or disclosing any of your information for any reason other than to fulfill their contracted services.
</p>
<h2>Transferability</h2>
<p>
In the event that Ziplist, LLC is sold or is a party to a business transaction where all or substantial all of its assets are transferred to a
third party, we reserve the right to transfer your Account Information and other personal information to that third party.
</p>
<h2>How We Collect Information</h2>
<h3>Browser Cookies and Pixel Tags</h3>
<p>
A browser cookie ("Cookie") is a small piece of information stored by a web browser that is used to communicate with a web server when the
browser connects to a web site. A browser Cookie is persistent, which means that once it is placed in your web browser, it will stay there until it is deleted.
</p>
<p>In addition to Cookies, we or third party advertisers may also utilize "Pixel Tags" (also know as "1x1 gifs," "clear gifs," or "web beacons.")</p>
<p>We might utilize one or more Cookies or Pixel Tags in order to enhance and tailor your experience with ZipList.</p>
<h3>Ways in which we may use Cookies and Pixel Tags:</h3>
<h4>To store user login information and your preferences.</h4>
<p class="indent">Perhaps the simplest way we might use a Cookie is to make your ZipList experience more efficient by saving your login and preference information.</p>
<h4>To acquire information about your web browser in order to modify or improve your browsing experience with ZipList.</h4>
<p class="indent">
This information is stored in our web server logs (more information below on how we use web server logs) and helps provide us with information
regarding how you and other Users are utilizing ZipList.
</p><h4>To understand activity within any given session of Use</h4>
<p class="indent">
We may use Session Cookies to gather information regarding when and how long you use ZipList in any given session. Session
Cookies are not persistent – that is to say they are not stored in your web browser – they are deleted as soon as you close your browser.
</p>
<h4>To provide you with personalized content or other information.</h4>
<p class="indent">
Based on both personal and aggregate information, we may use a browser Cookie to dynamically select from a variety of dynamic
or updated content or information.
</p>
<p class="indent">
We do not store any personal information in the Cookie, but we may link information in the Cookie to your Account Information.
If we choose to do so, our use of the Cookie will be governed by the terms and conditions in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h4>To Assist in Targeted Advertising</h4>
<p class="indent">
We may use information stored in the Cookie to determine which advertisements may be displayed to you by ZipList. Additionally,
advertisements displayed to you may be served directly from third parties, and these third parties may place their own Cookies in
your browser. This allows them, among other things, to recognize which advertisements are viewed and clicked.
</p>
<p class="indent">
We or other third parties may use Pixel Tags personalize advertisements, track activity and gain a better understand of the
effectiveness of these ads. Beyond the use of Pixel Tags on the ZipList Service, Pixel Tags may also be placed in email messages sent from us or
by third parties on our behalf.
</p>
<p class="indent">
We do not have the ability to access or control Cookies or Pixel Tags that may be used by third party advertisers. Accordingly, our
Privacy Policy only covers Cookies or Pixel Tags used by ZipList and is does not encompass the use of these or other tracking methods utilized
by any of its advertisers.
</p>
<h3>You may choose to block browser Cookies</h3>
<p>
Although most web browsers are by default set to accept Cookies, you do not have to accept Cookies. At any time you
can exclude them from being stored in your browser by configuring it to reject Cookies (some browsers may also allow you to be notified to selectively
accept or reject Cookies on a case-by-case basis). Each web browser has a different method in which to configure its Cookie policy, so refer to the help
information provided by each browser developer on how to configure it. However, if you block Cookies from ZipList, you may be prevented from signing on
to ZipList or certain features or capabilities may not work properly.
</p>
<h3>Web Server Log Files</h3>
<p>
Web servers may store anonymous, non-personally identifiable information such as browser types, domain names and incoming IP address. We may use this
information to change or modify ZipList, to assess or monitor the Service’s performance or utilization, to gather and analyze trend information and
to collect demographic information. Although web server logs do not store personally identifiable information, we may link this information to your
Account Information to provide personalized offers, services or advertisements to you. Should we link your Account Information with web server logs,
that information will be governed under this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
<p>
ZipList may contain links to other websites that are outside of the ziplist.com domain, which are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage you
to be aware of when you leave the ziplist.com domain and read the privacy policies of every site that collects personally identifiable information.
This Privacy Policy only covers information collected by ZipList.
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
Your Account Information is stored on a secured server which is located behind a firewall. Please do not use email or instant message to transmit private
or personal information to us as neither are secure forms of communication. Please contact us as security@ziplist.com if you have any questions regarding
the security of ZipList.
</p>
<h2>Changing or Removing Information</h2>
<p>
You may access, change or delete Account Information at any time by editing your personal profile located on the 'Profile' page of Ziplist. Any
changes that you make to your Account Information will be updated immediately. Should you wish to de-activate your account, send an email to
<a href="mailto:support@ziplist.com?subject=Please de-activate my ZipList account">our Support Team at support@ziplist.com</a>
from the email address
that you have registered with ZipList. Backup or archived copies of your
Account Information may persist with ZipList's systems for a reasonable time but will not be available to other Users or Third Parties.
</p>
