<h2>What is personal information?</h2>
<p>Personal information means information that identifies you as an individual, or that we can combine with readily available information to identify you as an individual.</p>
<h2>What personal information we collect and how we use it</h2>
<p>The principle purposes for which we collect and store your personal and financial information are to process your application, allow you to reserve and use our vehicles, authorize payment, bill you, respond to your inquiries, improve our products and services and maintain your account with us.</p>
<p><strong>When you visit the Zipcar websites,</strong> our servers automatically log certain information about your use of our websites, such as your IP address, your browser type, operating system, browser language and service provider.  We also collect information about your activities on our websites, such as the pages you visit or the ads or links you click on.  The first time you visit a Zipcar website, Zipcar assigns you a unique number, which is stored in one or more cookies on your computer's hard drive. These cookies help us distinguish new visitors from returning visitors and enable us to measure the effectiveness of content on the website and refine and tailor that content to suit our visitors' interests. If you have joined Zipcar or provided other personal information about yourself (for example, if you send us an email), your cookie ID can be associated with you personally.  To learn more about cookies and how Zipcar customizes the content and offers for you, please see "<strong>Advertising and Personalized Content</strong>" below.</p>
<p><strong>Zipcar collects information that you voluntarily submit to us</strong>, such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number, if you include that information in an email, or text message sent to us or that you tell us over the telephone, in an instant message or by other means. Your telephone calls and email correspondence with us may be recorded or monitored for quality control, training and similar purposes. By using these communication methods you are consenting to the recording or monitoring of your calls and emails with Zipcar.</p>
<p><strong>If you apply to join Zipcar</strong>, we collect personal and financial information as you proceed through the stages of our online application, membership agreement and reservation process.  In addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect your driver's license number and the jurisdiction in which you are registered and credit card or other payment information.  We may also collect information such as your driving record from regulatory bodies where you live, and from third parties. This information is used to process your application and, if you are approved, for the purposes described below.</p>
<p><strong>If you join Zipcar and use our services</strong>, we collect information about your reservations (dates, times, locations, etc.) and your use of the Zipcar service (return time, mileage, accidents, etc.).  We use this information to bill you, respond to your inquiries, provide and improve our products and services and maintain your account with us, to personalize your Zipcar experience (i.e., by understanding your preferences), and to provide content and offers that we think may be of interest to you.  To learn more about how Zipcar customizes the content and offers you please see "Advertising and Personalized Content" below. From time to time we will send newletter emails. To unsubscribe from our newsletters please use the opt out in the account settings page.</p>
<p><strong>Zipcars may be equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) vehicle tracking technology.</strong>  GPS is a network of satellites that allows us to determine the location (latitude and longitude) of Zipcars.  This information is transmitted to Zipcar and temporarily stored (including while it is hired to you).  Zipcar uses this information for a variety of important purposes.  For example, we use GPS data to help you find a car you have reserved, to provide roadside assistance when you need it, to ensure that a car is available at the place and time you have reserved, to alert us when a Zipcar is likely to be returned late and to locate lost or stolen Zipcars. We do not actively track or monitor vehicle location, and we do not store historical GPS data regarding vehicle location â€“ we use GPS data only to determine the last reported location of Zipcars.</p>
<p><strong>Refer a Friend.</strong> If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friendâ€™s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Zipcar stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.  Your friend may contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@zipcar.com">privacy@zipcar.com</a>&nbsp;to request that we remove this information from our database; however, if someone else subsequently refers the same friend, their email address may be stored again.</p>
