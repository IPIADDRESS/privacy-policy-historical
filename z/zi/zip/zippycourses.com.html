<p>We believe your business is no one else’s. Your privacy is important to you and to us. So we’ll protect the information you share with us. To protect your privacy, DHJW Software LLC dba “Zippy Courses™” follows different principles in accordance with worldwide practices for customer privacy and data protection.</p>
<ul>

<li>We’ll use security measures to protect your information from unauthorized users.</li>

<h2>NOTICE</h2>
<p>When you purchase and install the Software, we ask you to register and create an account. When you do, we create a personal profile for you from your registration information. We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”) or enables us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you create an account subscription on the website, download our Software, or signup for email newsletters. We use your Personal Information for four primary purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To make the website easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</li>
<li>To help you quickly find Software or information.</li>
<li>To help us create content most relevant to you.</li>
<li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and other new services from us.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CONSENT</h2>
<p>If you choose not to register or provide Personal Information, you can still review the website but you will not be able to access areas that require registration.</p>
<p>If you decide to register, you will be able to select the kinds of information you want to receive from us by subscribing to various services, like our electronic newsletters. If you do not want us to communicate with you about other offers regarding DHJW Software LLC dba “Zippy Courses™” products, programs, events, or services by email, postal mail, or telephone, you may select the option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from us.</p>

<h2>OPTING OUT</h2>
<p>You may tell us not to share your information with our affiliates (meaning companies under common control or ownership) for their own marketing purposes or with unaffiliated business partners as part of a joint marketing arrangement. Even if you don’t “opt out,” we will not share your information with unaffiliated companies for their own marketing purposes except as part of a joint marketing arrangement. You can also “opt out” anytime by contacting us at: <a href="mailto:support@zippycourses.com">support@zippycourses.com</a>.</p>
<h2>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</h2>
<p>When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, including your name and email address. We use this information to send you updates about your order and advertising and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer. We may also use your email address internally for retargeting purposes and to create custom audiences on social media websites like Facebook.</p>
<p>When you order from us, through our third-party shopping cart and payment processing providers, we ask for your credit card number and billing address. This information is stored with the third-party shopping cart and payment processing providers so they can authorize your payment. We use this information only to bill you for the Software you order at that time and for any subscription or renewals you have ordered. We use the third-party providers to help reduce the risk of your payment information being inadvertently released or deliberately accessed by an unauthorized person.</p>

DHJW Software LLC dba “Zippy Courses™” is permitted to disclose your Personal Information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with applicable legal requirements or comply with legal process served on DHJW Software LLC dba “Zippy Courses™” or the website; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of DHJW Software LLC dba “Zippy Courses™” and its website,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zippycourses.com/">www.zippycourses.com</a>, and, (c) act in good faith in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of other users of DHJW Software LLC dba “Zippy Courses™”, its websites, or the public.</p>
<h2>CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS</h2>
<p>If the company or the website is sold, we may transfer your Personal Information to the extent reasonable to allow the buyer to continue to provide the relevant services to you. If the company is sold in its entirety, your Personal Information will remain the property of the company. If the website is sold, your Personal Information will be transferred with your account as appropriate so that you may continue to receive the services to which you are entitled and to receive the benefits that we have offered to you. DHJW Software LLC dba “Zippy Courses™” will make these determinations about the transfer of your Personal Information in good faith. If we were unable to transfer your Personal Information under these circumstances, we could be unable to sell the company or the website and you could lose access to the services to which you would be entitled.</p>

<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. DHJW Software LLC dba “Zippy Courses™” is committed to ensuring that your information is secure, and we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, however we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>When you order the Software and/or access your Personal Information, you are using SSL secure server technology, which encrypts your Personal Information before it is transmitted over the Internet.</p>
<p>We engage third-party shopping carts, payment processing providers, or service providers to help us process customer credit cards, which information is governed by our third-party service providers’ privacy policies. For more information on the privacy policies for our service providers who are collecting Personal Information for credit card processing, please see their individual privacy policies.</p>
