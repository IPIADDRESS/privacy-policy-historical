					<p class="textsectionhead">Privacy Policy</p>
					<p class="textbody">At Zip.ca we respect and are committed to protecting your 
						privacy, and we support a general policy of openness about how we collect, use 
						and disclose your personal information.</p>
					<p class="textbody">This Privacy Policy informs you how Zip.ca collects, uses and 
						discloses the personal information that you provide to us through use of our 
						website and subscription to our DVD rental services. By subscribing to the 
						Zip.ca DVD rental service, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of 
						your personal information in accordance with this Policy.</p>
					<p class="textbody">This Privacy Policy also explains how you can contact us if you 
						have a question about our Privacy Policy, want to change or update your 
						personal information or change your preferences concerning our use and 
						disclosure of your personal information.</p>
					<p class="textbody">We recommend that you take the time to read this Privacy Policy 
						so that you understand how we handle and process your personal information. As 
						we develop and expand our services, this Privacy Policy may also change. We 
						will include a "last amended " date on the Policy as displayed on the website. 
						We strongly encourage you to refer back to the Privacy Policy periodically.
					</p>
					<p class="textbody">For the purpose of this Privacy Statement, "personal 
						information" means information about an identifiable individual, but does not 
						include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee 
						of an organization. Zip.ca will not collect, use or disclose your personal 
						information in a way that is incompatible with this Privacy Statement.

					<p class="textheader">How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information <a name="collect">
							&nbsp;</a></p>
					<p class="textsubheader">Processing of Orders and Subscriptions</p>
					<p class="textbody">When you subscribe to the Zip.ca DVD rental service, we ask for 
						your email address and a password, for your name, postal address, telephone 
						number and a valid credit card number. We use this information to process your 
						rental requests and to ship requested DVDs to you. We use your telephone number 
						for the sole purpose of contacting you in the event of shipping or 
						order-related issues, and not for marketing or other purposes. We request that 
						you provide a valid credit card number during the Free Trial Subscription 
						period in the event that DVDs shipped during this period are not returned and 
						charges for unreturned DVDs assessed. If you are paying by credit card, we 
						continue to use the credit card number provided by you initially for billing 
						purposes should you not cancel and continue as a Zip.ca member. If you select 
						the automatic debit payment option for your subscription, we will ask you for 
						the name of your bank, your account number and other bank identifiers.</p>
					<p class="textbody">We use your email address to notify you that DVDs in your 
						rental list have been shipped to you, to answer inquiries that you send to us, 
						and to communicate with you when necessary concerning billing, the 
						administration of your account and the processing of your rental requests. As 
						these functions are necessary to the proper administration of your subscription 
						account, we do not offer an opt-out from such email communication.</p>
					<p class="textsubheader">Rental History</p>
					<p class="textbody">We track and retain your order history so that you can access 
						the DVDs you have rented previously, and to remove shipped titles from your 
						rental list. You can access your order history in the Your Account section of 
						the website. This information is available to you alone and is not disclosed to 
						other users, members or third parties.</p>
					<p class="textsubheader">DVD Ratings and Recommendations</p>
					<p class="textbody">Our website contains a "Rating" feature where you can, at your 
						option, rate any DVD in our library on a scale of 1 to 5. If you rate a movie 
						you have rented, we use this information to personalize the Recommendations 
						feature of the website that is accessible to you when you log in. If you do not 
						wish to receive personalized recommendations, please do not use the "Ratings" 
						feature. Subscribers who do not use the Ratings feature will receive standard 
						Recommendations issued by Zip.ca.</p>
					<p class="textsubheader">Affiliate Program</p>
					<p class="textbody">Zip.ca also offers an Affiliate Program, where affiliate 
						members direct customers to Zip.ca through links on their Web sites. We ask 
						affiliate members for their site name (URL), mailing address, primary contact, 
						pay-to address, technical contact, and other site-related information to 
						determine whether a site will be included in our Affiliate Program. You can go 
						to the Affiliate Program area for more details. The information collected from 
						our affiliates is used strictly for that program; none of this information is 
						used for general marketing purposes. In order to administer the Affiliate 
						Program we log information from the URL of a referring website when members 
						subscribe to Zip.ca. We do not use this information for any other purpose, nor 
						do we disclose any Zip.ca member information to affiliate members.</p>
					<p class="textsubheader">Share With a Friend Feature</p>
					<p class="textbody">You can use the Share With a Friend feature on the Zip.ca 
						website to inform others about our services or website. We provide an email 
						transmission for you to send for this purpose. While we facilitate this email 
						transmission, we do not retain any text or the email address(es) to which you 
						send when using this feature.
					</p>
					<p class="textsubheader">Email for Marketing Purposes</p>
					<p class="textbody">When you register with Zip.ca, we offer you an opportunity to 
						opt-out of receiving email communications from us that inform you about new 
						DVDs, promote new or additional services or contain special offers from Zip.ca 
						and our corporate affiliates in the Internet services sector. If you do not 
						opt-out, we will use your personal information for these purposes and may also 
						disclose your email address and/or name to our corporate affiliates so that 
						they can send you such information directly. To exercise the opt-out at any 
						time, visit the Your Account section.</p>
					<p class="textsubheader">Rental and Subscription Services Analysis</p>
					<p class="textbody">Zip.ca may also generate aggregate information about rentals, 
						requests for titles and use of the subscription services to assist it in 
						assessing and improving the subscription service. Zip.ca does not use personal 
						information in generating such analysis, nor does it relate this information to 
						any individual member.</p>
					<p class="textsubheader">Cookies and Web Logs</p>
					<p class="textbody">When you visit the Zip.ca website, cookies are placed on your 
						hard drive. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can store 
						on your web browser and later retrieve. We use sessional cookies to help us 
						track items you select, to match your address and order and to assist in the 
						log in to your account. We use permanent cookies to help us track use of our 
						website, such as the number and frequency of visits to our pages and which 
						parts of our website are visited. Most browsers will allow you to disable 
						cookies, or allow only sessional cookies to be placed. If your browser is set 
						to allow sessional cookies only, your use of the website will be unaffected. If 
						your browser is set to disable sessional cookies, you will not be able to log 
						in, create or update a rental list or use the Your Account section pages.</p>
					<p class="textbody">Zip.ca collects aggregate information concerning usage of the 
						website through automatically logged information. Zip.ca does not use any 
						personal information while generating this information, nor does it relate any 
						of this information to an individual member or user.</p>
					<p class="textsubheader">Updating Your Personal Information</p>
					<p class="textbody">You may update or change your personal information, or change 
						your opt-out preferences anytime by visiting the Your Account section.</p>
					<p class="textsubheader">When We Disclose Your Personal Information</p>
					<p class="textbody">Zip.ca will not sell, license, trade or rent your personal 
						information to or with unaffiliated third parties. Zip.ca will not otherwise 
						disclose your personal information except as described below.</p>
					<p class="textbody">Zip.ca may also disclose personal information about its members 
						to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order 
						legally requires or authorizes us to do so, to enforce and protect the terms 
						and conditions of our agreement(s) with you or the Terms of Use applicable to 
						our website, or to collect on outstanding accounts.
					</p>
					<p class="textbody">Zip.ca also reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer 
						personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual 
						purchase, sale, lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, 
						disposal or financing of all or any portion of Zip.ca or of any of the business 
						or assets or shares of Zip.ca, provided the third party represents that it will 
						continue to use the information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy 
						and in accordance with applicable privacy protection laws.
					</p>
					<p class="textsubheader">Retention of Your Personal Information</p>
					<p class="textbody">We retain your rental history for the period that you remain a 
						member, for the purposes described above. We do not retain this information 
						once your subscription is terminated. We retain your contact account and 
						shipping information for the periods required by applicable laws or limitation 
						periods.</p>
					<p class="textheader">How We Protect Your Personal Information <a name="protect">&nbsp;</a></p>
					<p class="textbody">Zip.ca makes all commercially reasonable efforts to protect 
						your personal information from loss, unauthorized access, misuse or theft. We 
						use a secure server (SSL) and encrypt all transmissions of personal information 
						by you. We limit access to your account information with login and password 
						protection features. We encourage you to change your password regularly and to 
						provide us with accurate information through the Your Account section feature.</p>
					<p class="textbody">Only those Zip.ca employees who have a legitimate business 
						purpose for accessing the personal information collected by us are authorized 
						to do so. Unauthorized access to or use of personal information by an employee 
						is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary action. In addition, our 
						management systems are configured so as to block or restrict employee access 
						from those without access privileges.</p>
					<p class="textheader">Links to Third Party Sites <a name="thirdparty">&nbsp;</a></p>
					<p class="textbody">This website may offer links to other third party websites. You 
						should be aware that operators of linked websites may also collect your 
						personal information (including information generated through the use of 
						cookies) when you link to their websites. Zip.ca is not responsible for how 
						such third parties collect, use or disclose your personal information, so it is 
						important to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of these websites 
						before providing your personal information on those sites.</p>
					<p class="textheader">Contacting Us <a name="contacting">&nbsp;</a></p>
					<p class="textbody">In the event that you have any questions about the Zip.ca 
						Privacy Statement or if you have reason to believe that we may have failed to 
						adhere to this Privacy Statement, you may contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@zip.ca">
