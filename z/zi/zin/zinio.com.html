  offensive, malicious in nature, or which infringes, or potentially infringes,
  any intellectual or other property rights (including copyright, patent,
  trademark and trade secret rights) of any person, or (iv) to any person or
  entity which uses or permits the use of the Publication(s) in any way that
  compromises the integrity thereof or which infringes any copyrights or

  <li><strong>Subscriptions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Certain of our Services are offered on a subscription basis ("Subscription").

  Zinio is required at the time of registration for such Services, and you agree
  to be billed periodically, based on the length of your Subscription. You agree
  to keep all Billing Method and other required information current. All
  Subscriptions will include "Continuous Service" which enables you to receive
  uninterrupted access to such Service, and delivery of associated Publications
  until you cancel your Subscription. Before the end of the initial subscription
  period, Zinio will inform you in writing of the termination date of such
  period, allowing you to cancel the subscription before any charge is made. You
  will be billed automatically, at the end of your then-current offer terms
  applicable to that Service. The end date of your current Subscription period
  is available in your account settings. You will be billed each month on the
  calendar day that your Subscription commenced. Where your Subscription began
  on a day not contained in a given month, you will be billed on the last day of
  such month. If your Billing Method has expired at the time of Subscription
  renewal, Zinio may immediately suspend, deactivate or delete your account and
  access to the Service. You may cancel a Subscription at any time. Where a
  Subscription is for a particular Publication, you will receive a refund for
  any unserved issues (see Refund Policy below). Where the Subscription is for
  access to Zinio Unlimited or Z-Pass, such access will continue until the end
  of the then-current subscription period and no refund will be offered.

  you cancel the Subscription during the free trial period, you will not be
  billed. If you do not cancel the Subscription during the free trial period,
  you will be billed at the end of the free trial period for the first
  Subscription period occurring thereafter applicable to the Service that you
  purchased. Free trials are limited to one per user, per Service. Before the
  end of the initial subscription period, Zinio will inform you in writing of
  the termination date of such period, allowing you to cancel the subscription
  before any charge is made.
