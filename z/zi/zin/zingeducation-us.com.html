                <br>
                We take the privacy concerns of our users very seriously. We strive to ensure that businesses and
    their websites are fairly and accurately represented on this website.
    <br>
                <br>
                As the listings shown on this website come from a number of sources, we understand that there may be
    times when businesses or websites that are listed here may wish for their details to be changed or
    even removed completely. Should that be the case, authorised representatives of websites may <a href="/contactus">contact us</a>
                directly should they wish their listing be removed. We will act promptly to make sure that the changes
    are made as quickly as possible.
    <br>
                <br>
                We will never display personal information about a website's authorised representative(s). Authorised
    representative(s) of websites may supply their name and contact details to us to assist us in maintaining
    a business relationship with them, however such details will be held in strict confidence and will never
    be displayed on this website, nor passed onto any third party. The only exception to this may be if the
    authorised representative(s) place such personal information within the website description section of
    their listing, in which case it will be displayed on this site.
    <br>
                <br>
                Users who list their business or website on this site are obliged to provide their email address.
    We will never pass that email address on to any third party. We also
    will not use it to send you marketing and/or advertising material, unless such material is required as
    part of the normal business relationship between a user and us.
    <br>
                <br>
                We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may
    use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your
    visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of
    interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and would like to know your
    options in relation to not having this information used by these companies, click
    <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/privacy_ads.html">here</a>.
    <br>
                <br>
                We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any information we collect is stored in a secure manner
    and protected from unauthorised access.
