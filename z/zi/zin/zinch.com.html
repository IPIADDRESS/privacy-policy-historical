                          Zinch, LLC (together with Zinch.com, “Zinch”) is committed to respecting the privacy of the students who use the site to create online profiles. We strive to provide a safe, secure online user experience. By choosing to create a Zinch Profile you
                          are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy sets forth the online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to Zinch.com and does not apply to information we collect in any other fashion.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link from Zinch.com or any of our affiliate sites (the “Zinch Sites”). We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the other websites to which you choose to link from Zinch.com, including the Zinch Sites, so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. High school students (“Users”) participate in Zinch voluntarily. Participation in this website enables students to organize and structure
                          their college admissions related materials and thoughts, access guidance and advice
                          by way of the Zinch blog and receive information related to their educational needs
                          helping them plan for the future. The most important benefit of participating in Zinch is the information students and their families will receive from participating
                          colleges and universities.  Zinch also uses student data for research purposes to enable colleges, universities and other educational institutions to have a greater understanding of the current pool of potential applicants. Colleges and Universities
                          use Zinch student data in their outreach and recruitment efforts, but Zinch is not
                          an application tool. All Zinch Users must still perform the standard, institution
                          appropriate, application process as determined by each individual college or university.
                          Zinch does not replace the college application process. When educational institutions
                          register with Zinch through our Zinch.com service they gain access to the online
                          database. Educational institutions include accredited colleges and universities,
                          secondary and higher educational institutions, and nonprofit institutions whose
                          purposes advance the mission of Zinch, add value to the admission and/or recruitment
                          process, and increase the educational opportunities of our Users (“Third Parties”).

                      <b>What Information is Collected</b>
                      <p>
                          Information collected may include, among other things, a participating student’s
                          name, physical address, e-mail address, phone number, age, citizenship, details of academic and work history, preferences about the student’s educational future
                          and other information entered into the student profile. All information entered
                          is voluntary. Examples of areas on Zinch where we collect data are pages where students
                          can open a Zinch account, create a Zinch profile (a “Zinch Profile”), sign up to use Zinch.com services or the services of other Zinch Sites, or enter a contest.
                          Zinch has an array of possible information to fill out in order to better help students
                          be recruited, but it is solely up to the student whether he or she furnishes such
                          information. If a User does provide such information, he or she is thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.  All posting done in the User’s profile that is original work including, but not limited to, music, essays, and art work is not available for public use or for sale by Zinch.  The User maintains full rights and ownership of personal work.

                      <br>
                      We work with colleges, universities and educational institutions to provide targeted recruiting and outreach. Only those schools who have registered and been authenticated
                      by the Zinch staff in accordance with the Zinch Letter of Understanding are authorized
                      to view information contained in our database. When a college or university registers,
                      it becomes a Zinch-friendly school. Each college and university has a personal contact
                      on the Zinch staff whose job it is to oversee relations, provide assistance, and
                      understand the recruiting needs of each college and university.

                      </strong>
                      <br>
                      All personal information is gathered directly from Users through online registration forms. Only the User can modify his or her own, personal Zinch Profile once it has been created.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>Personal, Student Information May Be Utilized For the Following Purposes:</strong>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      • For the student to contact institutions of higher education so as to indicate
                      interest in a particular college or university; • To allow college and university
                      admissions officers, educational institutions and/or Third Parties to access information in order to contact and recruit students; • To provide information or services that
                      a User has requested; • To service a User’s account; • To improve Zinch’s services; 
•	To develop and/or inform Users of additional products or services we think will be of interest and benefit to Users;
•	To answer questions Users may have; and 
•	To inform winners of sweepstakes which we run on occasion.<br>

                      <br>
                      When a student registers with Zinch, he or she creates a unique Zinch Profile and
                      establishes individualized privacy settings. Zinch Profile information, including
                      User’s name, email and photo, are displayed to registered, Zinch-friendly colleges
                      and universities that search through the Zinch database to recruit students. Students
                      must select opt-in settings in order to share this personal information with any
                      and all other parties that have been authorized by Zinch to use the database. Users
                      will select how and with whom they wish to share their information. This is not a social networking site.  Other students on Zinch.com will not be able to view Zinch
                      Profiles other than their own or any information therein.  Each User is able to edit and update the information provided in his or her Zinch Profile. This data may also be reviewed and accessed by Third Parties which may contact Users. Also, Zinch may
                      allow related businesses (i.e. test prep services and other businesses deemed appropriate and relevant to the furtherance of the overall mission of Zinch) to access Users’
                      Zinch Profiles and to contact Users about their products and services. We may, on
                      occasion, email our Users to send notifications about new features on the site.
                      Each User shall be required to opt-in to have his or her information visible to
                      third parties. All registered colleges and universities will have access to student
                      information on Zinch. All organizations and institutions other than accredited colleges
                      and universities will need User consent to proceed in viewing and communicating
                      with Users.

                      <br>
                      We do not disclose Users’ personal information, combined personal and demographic
                      information or information about use of Zinch.com to Third Parties, except as set forth below. 1.	We disclose information to third parties when, and only when, Users
                      consent to such disclosure at the time of registration for a Zinch.com account and
                      at any time when a User edits profile information. With consent, we may supply contact
                      information to organizations such as, but not limited to, university and college recruiters, data aggregators, and marketers for the purpose of sending e-mail or
                      otherwise communicating with our Users. We rely on self reported data (such as the interests and preferences Users have expressed) to determine whether our Users might be interested in the opportunities, products or services of a particular organization.

2.	We disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property of our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.

3.	We would disclose and transfer information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, we, or our trustee in bankruptcy, may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. Users
                      will be notified of any sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party via email or through a prominent notice posted on Zinch.com.

                      Users who choose to register, and who authorize consent, are allowing their Zinch Profiles to be searched by recruiters who access to our database. It is our intention to give access to our database only to authorized colleges, universities, educational
                      institutions and Third Parties, but we cannot guarantee that others will not, without our consent, access this data. You may remove your Zinch Profile from our database at any time; however, recruiters and others who have gained access to the data may have already saved a copy of your Zinch Profile. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of Zinch Profiles in this situation.

Our server logs provide us with information such as what pages are being visited most, what domains our visitors are coming from (i.e. aol.com), when our servers are busiest, and what websites are referring Users to us. This information helps us to improve our services and to evaluate our marketing efforts. We only use such data anonymously and aggregately.

                      We use cookie technology within Zinch.com. We use cookies for remembering User names and passwords and for tracking click streams. This allows Users to send inquiries to multiple institutions without the need to re-enter usernames and passwords each time. We do not utilize cookies to track Users activities in any other way. Cookies cannot obtain personally identifiable information such as e-mail addresses, or any
                      other information stored on our Users hard drives. Cookies are pieces of data normally stored by your browser, and you can quite easily prevent cookie data from being sent by adjusting your browser settings; however Zinch.com will not function properly if Cookies are not enabled. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Zinch pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience.

                      <br>
                      When a User submits information to Zinch, whether it be name, address, email or phone number, we do our utmost to ensure that information is protected against loss, misuse, alteration, destruction or unauthorized access. Zinch uses standard encryption tools such as SSL (Secure Socket Layer) to help protect personal information and to keep information collected secure. Encryption can be used after your data has left your internal system. Encryption renders your data unreadable using a mathematical formula known as the key. Your data is turned back into readable form, i.e. deciphered, by applying the correct key. Due to the nature of this technology, there is always a remote danger of information interception no matter what barriers are in place.
                      Our system does provide for profiles to be sent via un-encrypted email, and may be susceptible to intercept at this point. Employees within Zinch with access to
                      User information provided are instructed to utilize such information only in adherence to this Privacy Policy. Employees who utilize information for any reason other than the reasons stated within this Privacy Policy may be subject to reprimand or even legal proceedings. Third parties which access your data are instructed and agree to utilize such information only in adherence to this Privacy Policy; however Zinch is not responsible for the actions of third parties. We do, however, take reasonable
                      measures to monitor the actions of third parties. Zinch retains the right to withdraw
                      contractual relations with third parties found to undermine and/or damage the integrity
                      of agreed upon educational purposes of third party communication. Zinch.com and the other Zinch Sites also contain links to other sites. The privacy policies of linked sites may differ from those of Zinch.
