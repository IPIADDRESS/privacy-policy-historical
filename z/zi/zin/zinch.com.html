            <p>Zinch, LLC (together with Zinch.com, “Zinch”) is committed to 
            respecting the privacy of our users. We strive to provide a safe, 
            secure online user experience. This Privacy Policy sets forth the 
            online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply 
            to Zinch.com and does not apply to information we collect in any 
            other fashion. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or 
            practices of other websites to which you choose to link from 
            Zinch.com or any of our affiliate sites (the “Zinch Sites”). We 
            encourage you to review the privacy policies of the other websites 
            to which you choose to link from Zinch.com, including the Zinch 
            Sites, so you can understand how they collect, use and share your 
            information.</p>
            <p>High school students participate in Zinch voluntarily. 
            Participation in this website enables students to receive 
            information which is related to their educational needs and helps 
            them plan for the future. The most important benefit of 
            participating in Zinch is the information students and their 
            families will receive from colleges and universities. Zinch also 
            uses student data for research purposes to enable colleges, 
            universities and other educational institutions to have a greater 
            understanding of the current pool of potential applicants.</p>
            <p>Zinch allows full access to our online information free of charge 
            when users of Zinch.com (“Users”) register with Zinch through our 
            Zinch.com service. This service allows prospective students to 
            create profiles on our servers. Data collected can then be accessed 
            and purchased by educational institutions such as, but not limited 
            to, universities and colleges. </p><b>What Information is 
            Collected</b> 
            <p>Information collected may include, among other things, your name, 
            physical address, e-mail address, phone number and other information 
            about yourself. We may also ask for information such as your age, 
            citizenship, details of your academic and work history, and your 
            preferences about your educational future.</p>
            <p>Examples of areas on Zinch.com where we collect personal or 
            combined personal and demographic data are pages where you can open 
            a Zinch account, create a Zinch profile or account (a “Zinch 
            Profile”), sign up to use Zinch.com services or the services of 
            other Zinch Sites, enter a contest or purchase a product. Zinch.com 
            has an array of possible information to fill out in order to better 
            help you be recruited, but it is solely up to you whether you 
            furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you 
            are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance 
            with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. 
            All posting done in your private profile that is your original work 
            including, but not limited to, music, essays, and art work is not 
            available for public use or for sale by Zinch. You maintain full 
            rights and ownership of your personal work.</p><b>Schools</b> 
            <p>We work with schools and institutions to provide targeted 
            recruiting helping both the student and the university find the 
            right fit. Your school, district, or state may arrange for you to 
            participate in our programs and may purchase products on your 
            behalf. We may share personally-identifiable information that you 
            provide to us through your participation in these school programs 
            with your school, district and your parents. In addition, your 
            school may require us to share your information with others legally 
            entitled to access your academic records, such as your state 
            department of education.</p><b>How Information is Collected</b> 
            <p>All personal information is gathered directly from Users through 
            online registration forms. Only you can modify your Zinch Profile 
            once it has been created.</p><b>Personal Information Collected About 
            You May Be Utilized For the Following Purposes: </b>
            <p>• To allow you to contact institutions of higher education and 
            related businesses; <br>• To allow institutions of higher education 
            and related businesses to purchase information in order to contact 
            and recruit students; <br>• To provide information or services you 
            have requested; <br>• To service your account; <br>• To improve our 
            services; <br>• To develop and/or inform you of additional products 
            or services we think will be of interest to you; <br>• To answer 
            questions you may have; and <br>• To inform winners of sweepstakes 
            which we run on occasion.</p><b>Use of Information Obtained by 
            Zinch</b> 
            <p>When you register with Zinch, you create your own Zinch Profile 
            and privacy settings. Your Zinch Profile information, as well as 
            your name, email and photo, are displayed to universities and 
            colleges that search through our database to recruit you. This is 
            not a social networking site. Other students on Zinch.com will not 
            be able to view your Zinch Profile or any information therein. Your 
            Zinch Profile may be utilized by Zinch to service your account and 
            inform you of Zinch services. You are also able to edit and update 
            the information you provide in your Zinch Profile. Your data may 
            also be reviewed and accessed by other academic institutions, which 
            may contact you in an effort to recruit you to attend their 
            institution. Also, we can allow related businesses (i.e. test prep 
            services, loan providers, and other businesses deemed appropriate by 
            Zinch) to access your Zinch Profile and to contact you and let you 
            know about their products and services. </p><b>What We Will Not Use 
            Your Information For</b> 
            <p>We respect your privacy! Except as described above, or as 
            otherwise provided or permitted by law, your information collected 
            by Zinch.com will not be used in any other way.</p><b>More Regarding 
            the Disclosure of Personal Information to Others </b>
            <p>We do not disclose your personal information to third parties, or 
            your combined personal and demographic information or information 
            about your use of Zinch.com, except as set forth below.</p>
            <p>1. We disclose information to third parties when you consent to 
            such disclosure at the time you register for a Zinch.com account. We 
            supply your contact information to third parties such as, but not 
            limited to, university and college recruiters, data aggregators, 
            marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or 
            otherwise communicating with you. We use data we have about you 
            (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to 
            determine whether you might be interested in the opportunities, 
            products or services of a particular third-party.<br>2. We disclose 
            information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a 
            governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action 
            is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with 
            legal process; (b) protect our rights or property of our affiliated 
            companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) 
            protect the personal safety of users or the public.<br>3. We 
            disclose and transfer information to a third party who acquires all 
            or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition 
            is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a 
            substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event we 
            become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or 
            involuntary, we, or our trustee in bankruptcy, may sell, license or 
            otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by 
            the bankruptcy court. You will be notified of any sale of all or a 
            substantial portion of our business to a third party via email or 
            through a prominent notice posted on 
            Zinch.com.</p><br><b>Accessibility of Profiles</b> 
            <p>Users who choose to register are allowing their Zinch Profiles to 
            be searched by recruiters who pay for access to our database. It is 
            our intention to give access to our database only to paying 
            recruiters and clients, but we cannot guarantee that others will 
            not, without our consent, access this data. You may remove your 
            Zinch Profile from our database at any time; however, recruiters and 
            others who have gained access to the data may have already saved a 
            copy of your Zinch Profile. We are not responsible for the 
            retention, use or privacy of Zinch Profiles in this situation, or 
            while Zinch Profiles are stored in our database.</p><b>Posting to 
            Public Areas</b> 
            <p>Please remember that if you post any of your personal information 
            in public areas of Zinch.com, such as in online forums or chat 
            rooms, such information may be collected and used by others over 
            whom we have no control. We are not responsible for the use made by 
            third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in 
            public areas of Zinch.com.</p><b>Correction of 
            Information/Accessibility of Information</b> 
            <p>We provide Users with 24 hour access to their personal 
            information after it has been collected. You may also wish to amend 
            or correct inaccuracies on information provided. If you wish to 
            correct such inaccuracies or make any other changes, information can 
            be accessed through our password protected access facility at 
            http://www.zinch.com. If you wish to have your Zinch Profile deleted 
            from our server, you should contact support@zinch.com. Removal from 
            the Zinch server does not guarantee that your Zinch Profile will be 
            removed from third party records. Any information gathered is to the 
            best of our knowledge collected lawfully and fairly through 
            Zinch.com and all information is assumed accurate and up to date and 
            only information which is adequate and not excessive to our purpose 
            for collection is retained.</p>
            <p>You may review, correct, update or change your Zinch Profile and 
            the information therein at any time. From your Zinch account you may 
            also opt out of receiving newsletters and certain other information 
            from Zinch.</p><b>Children Under 14 Years of Age</b> 
            <p>Zinch does not intend to collect information from children. All 
            profiles stored are for high school students and those seeking 
            higher education who state their age to be 14 years or 
            older.</p><b>Aggregate Information About Our Users</b> 
            <p>We routinely gather information about the use Zinch.com and our 
            other Zinch Sites by all of our Users collectively. Our server logs 
            provide us with information such as what pages are being visited 
            most, what domains our visitors are coming from (i.e. aol.com), when 
            our servers are busiest, and what websites are referring Users to 
            us. This information helps us to improve our services and to 
            evaluate our marketing efforts. We only use such data anonymously 
            and aggregately. This information may be shared with third parties, 
            but only in the aggregate.</p><b>Cookies</b> 
            <p>We use cookie technology within Zinch.com. We use cookies for 
            remembering User names and passwords and for tracking click streams. 
            This allows you to send inquiries to multiple institutions without 
            the need to re-enter your username and password each time. We do not 
            utilize cookies to track your activities in any other way. Cookies 
            cannot obtain personally identifiable information such as your 
            e-mail address, or any other information stored on your hard drive. 
            Cookies are pieces of data normally stored by your browser, and you 
            can quite easily prevent cookie data from being sent by adjusting 
            your browser settings; however Zinch.com will not function properly 
            if Cookies are not enabled. </p>
            <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a 
            convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to 
            tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For 
            example, if you personalize Zinch pages, or register for services, a 
            cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user 
            name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we 
            can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized 
            site experience.</p><b>Information Protection and Security</b> 
            <p>When you submit your information to Zinch, whether it be your 
            name, address, email or phone number, we do our utmost to ensure 
            that information is protected against loss, misuse, alteration, 
            destruction or unauthorized access. Zinch uses standard encryption 
            tools such as SSL (Secure Socket Layer) to help protect your 
            personal information and to keep information collected secure.</p>
            <p>Encryption can be used after your data has left your internal 
            system. Encryption renders your data unreadable using a mathematical 
            formula known as the key. Your data is turned back into readable 
            form, i.e. deciphered, by applying the correct key.</p>
            <p>Due to the nature of this technology, there is always a remote 
            danger of information interception no matter what barriers are in 
            place.</p>
            <p>Our system does provide for profiles to be sent via un-encrypted 
            email, and may be susceptible to intercept at this point. </p>
            <p>Employees within Zinch with access to your information provided 
            are instructed to utilize such information only in adherence to this 
            Privacy Policy. Employees who utilize information for any reason 
            other than the reasons stated within this Privacy Policy may be 
            subject to reprimand or even legal proceedings.</p>
            <p>Third parties which access your data are instructed and agree to 
            utilize such information only in adherence to this Privacy Policy; 
            however Zinch is not responsible for the actions of third 
            parties.</p>
            <p>Zinch.com and the other Zinch Sites also contain links to other 
            sites. The privacy policies of linked sites may differ from those of 
            Zinch.</p><b>Cautions</b>
