                            <h1>Zimbra Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
                            <p>Thank you for visiting Zimbra Inc.'s ("Zimbra") Internet web site ("Site") located at the URL www.zimbra.com. This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout Zimbra governing Zimbra's use of personally identifiable information provided to Zimbra via this Site, through customers' voluntary reporting of information around product and/or system errors ("Error Reports") or through customers' voluntary reporting of the installation of the Zimbra software.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Privacy Policy Updates </h2>
                            <p>Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Zimbra may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If so, Zimbra will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at www.zimbra.com so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information.  Zimbra encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this Site and/or continued transmission of Error Reports to Zimbra will be subject to the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Information Collection and Use </h2>
                            <p>You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.  However, in certain sections of this Site, to use certain services, we may require you to register for an account, or we may invite you to submit questions or comments or request information, participate in surveys, questionnaires or contests, download trials or demonstrations, subscribe to newsletters or email alerts or participate in community forums.  Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may ask that you complete and submit an online form with personally identifiable information such as your name, username, email address, job title, address and phone number.  We may use your personally identifiable information to deliver certain services, products or information you have requested, verify your authority to enter certain password protected areas of the Site, send you notices for products and/or services that you have used or that may be of interest to you (if you have opted in to receive such notices) and improve the content and general administration of the Site.  If you are a registered user and post to any of the Sites community forums, other registered users of this Site may view your username and may send you emails, but they will not be able to see your actual email address unless you have elected to allow other registered users to see your email address.  </p>
                            <p>If you choose to transmit an Error Report to Zimbra, we may collect personally identifiable information that is included in the information that you elect to include in the Error Report that you provide to us.  We will use the personally identifiable information included in such Error Reports only to troubleshoot problems and errors and to prevent similar errors.  Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will not further use or nor will we disclose any personally identifiable information included in these Error Reports.</p>
                            <p>When you install any Zimbra software, you will have the option to notify Zimbra of your installation.  If you choose to notify Zimbra of your installation, we may collect personally identifiable information that is transmitted with your notification such as your email address, your domain and the version that you have installed.  We will use the personally identifiable information included with such notifications to improve the quality of Zimbra software and to manage and provide you with support and for marketing analysis. We may also use this information to send you marketing messages about products and services that might be of interest to you.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Children's Privacy </h2>
                            <p>Zimbra recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests.  No personally identifiable information is collected by Zimbra and Zimbra's services and Site are not intended for children under the age of 13.

                            <h2>Cookies </h2>
                            <p>We may use small text files called cookies to improve overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you.  Cookies must be enabled for you to use certain areas of the Site.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Aggregate Information </h2>

We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  We may share this aggregate information with third parties to assist them in targeting advertisements to appropriate audiences.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Disclosure </h2>
                            <p>We may provide your personally identifiable information that we collect and the data generated by cookies to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us.  For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to an organization in order to complete a service (e.g., process your payment) or diagnose an error.  Such third party entities will be obligated to a written confidentiality agreement that is at least as protective of your personally identifiable information as the terms of this Privacy Policy and they will not be permitted to further distribute your personally identifiable information.  We will also disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority.  We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any other company or organization except we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Zimbra participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Zimbra's assets to which this Site relates. </p>

                            <p>We process your personally identifiable information in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by you, the individual.  To the extent necessary for such purposes, we take reasonable steps to make sure that your personally identifiable information is accurate, complete, current and otherwise reliable with regard to its intended use.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Security </h2>
                            <p>We may employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with industry practice.

Zimbra may use encryption, secure socket layer, firewalls, internal restrictions, password protection and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information.</p>
