							<br>
							Ziggs, Inc. (“Ziggs”) is committed to respecting the privacy of our users. Ziggs strives to provide a safe and secure user experience. This Privacy Statement sets forth the online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to the web site located at www.ziggs.com (the “Site”). By using the Site, you consent to the policies and practices described in this Privacy Statement. <span class="contentBold">If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement, do not use the Site.</span>
							<br><br>
							The Site may contain links to web sites of both our affiliated and non-affiliated entities, including access to content, products and services of such affiliated and non-affiliated entities, over which Ziggs has no control (“Other Sites”). In some cases, these Other Sites may have the same (or a similar) look and feel as our Site and therefore may appear to be part of our Site. However, whenever you choose to access Other Sites or non-Ziggs content via the Ziggs Site, a separate browser window will launch and you will leave the Ziggs Site. Ziggs is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of Other web sites to which you choose to link from the Site. Ziggs encourages you to review the privacy policies of those other web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. This Privacy Statement applies solely to the Information (as defined below in the paragraph titled “Collection and Retention of Information”) collected on the Site, and does not apply to information Ziggs collects in any other fashion.

Sometimes Ziggs collects or may collect a combination of the two types of information. Ziggs also gathers or may gather certain information about your use of our Site (such as what areas you visit and what services you access) and information about your computer hardware and software, including without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring web site addresses (“Usage Information” and together with Demographic Information, “Non-Personal Information”).

							<span class="blackSubTitle">Use of Cookies</span>
							<br>
							Ziggs uses "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience, and facilitate your time online. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 
							<br><br>
							One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Ziggs pages, or register for services, a cookie helps Ziggs to recall your specific Information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of Ziggs’ use of cookies, Ziggs can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized Site experience. This means however that we do link personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.  When you return to the Site, the Information you previously provided can be retrieved with the use of cookies, so you can easily use the features that you customized. Ziggs also uses cookies to track click streams and for load balancing. 
							<br><br>
							You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the Site.

Web beacons are not used to access your Personal Information; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about Site usage.

							Web beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.
