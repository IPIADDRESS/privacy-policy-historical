<p><strong>Collaboration and Sharing Features.</strong> <br><br>
  The Ziddu Services offers collaboration features or other integrated tools, which allow you to share your Content through the Services. As a function of the collaborative nature of our Services and based on the permissions and settings you choose, the use of such features enables the sharing of Content with people you want to collaborate with or with the public.

  <strong>Security</strong> <br><br>
  While no service is completely secure, We takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. For example, we encrypt your Content when it is stored in our data centers. In addition, sensitive information such as credit card number and password that we request from you on the Services is protected with encryption, such as Secured Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, during transmission over the Internet.<br><br>
  The servers on which personal information is stored are kept in a controlled environment with limited access. While we take reasonable efforts to guard personal information we knowingly collect directly from you, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any passively-collected personal information you choose to include in documents you store on our systems are maintained at levels of protection to meet specific needs or obligations you may have relating to that information.<br><br>
  You may access your account information and our service only through the use of an individual user ID and password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. In addition, always logout and close your browser when you finish your session. Please note that we will never ask you to disclose your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.<br><br>
