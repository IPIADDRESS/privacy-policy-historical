      <div id="vspace"></div>
      While no service is completely secure, We takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. For example, we encrypt your Content when it is stored in our data centers. In addition, sensitive information such as credit card number and password that we request from you on the Services is protected with encryption, such as Secured Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, during transmission over the Internet.
      <div id="vspace"></div>
      The servers on which personal information is stored are kept in a controlled environment with limited access. While we take reasonable efforts to guard personal information we knowingly collect directly from you, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any passively-collected personal information you choose to include in documents you store on our systems are maintained at levels of protection to meet specific needs or obligations you may have relating to that information.
      <div id="vspace"></div>
      You may access your account information and our service only through the use of an individual user ID and password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. In addition, always logout and close your browser when you finish your session. Please note that we will never ask you to disclose your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.
      <div id="vspace"></div>

      We use various tracking technologies such as cookies and web beacons to collect information and distinguish you from other users of our Services, which may include saving cookies to your computer or mobile device.

      <div id="vspace"></div>
      <span class="bold">What is a web beacon?</span>
      <div id="vspace"></div>
      A web beacon (also known as "tracking pixels") is an electronic image, also called a "gif," that may be used in the Services or in emails that help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.
      <div id="vspace"></div>
      <span class="bold">How do we use these technologies?</span>
