			At Zions First National Bank ("Zions Bank") the privacy and security of our customers' personal information is of the utmost importance. We never take for granted the trust our customers have placed in us and we honor that trust by managing our customers' personal information with the highest level of care.
			<p>
			Safeguarding the privacy and security of customer information is a complex and dynamic process. This public statement is provided to help you understand what is involved in this process.
			</p><p>
			From time to time we may revise and redisclose this policy to reflect changes in technology, privacy law or changes in our operations and practices. If you have any questions about this policy statement please contact us at <b>1-866-299-3338</b>.
			</p><p>
			Throughout the Customer Privacy Policy, "we", "us" and "our" refer to Zions Bank. "You" and "your" refer to the customers of Zions Bank.
			</p><p>
			<span class="sectionTitle">Privacy Principles</span><br>
			Zions Bank has adopted the Privacy Principles that were cooperatively established by the leading U.S. banking industry trade associations. Therefore, we pledge to:
			</p><p>
			<b>Recognize a customer's expectation of privacy.</b><br>
			We recognize and respect the privacy expectations of our customers and want to explain principles of financial privacy to our customers in an appropriate fashion. These principles and the accompanying policy statement are provided to explain how we continuously work to meet our customers' expectation of privacy.
			</p><p>
			<b>Collect, use and retain a customer's information only if we believe that the customer will benefit.</b><br>
We collect, retain and use information about individual customers only where required by law, regulation or we reasonably believe it is useful and allowed by law in order to administer our business and to provide products, services and other opportunities to our customers.
			</p><p>
			<b>Maintain accurate information.</b><br>
			We have established procedures so that the customer's financial information we collect is accurate, current and complete in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. We will respond to requests from our customers to correct inaccurate information under our control in a timely manner.
			</p><p>
			<b>Limit employee access.</b><br>
			We limit employee access to personally identifiable information to those with a business reason for knowing such information. Our employees are trained to understand the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy and security. We have employee privacy and security guidelines in place and will take the appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce these guidelines.
			</p><p>
			<b>Protect information via established security procedures.</b><br>
			We have adopted appropriate security standards and procedures to guard against unauthorized access to customer information.
			</p><p>
			<b>Restrict the disclosure of account information.</b><br>
			We will not reveal specific information about customer accounts or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use with the following exceptions: 1) the information is provided to help complete a customer initiated transaction; 2) the customer requests it; 3) the disclosure is required by/or allowed by law (e.g., subpoena, investigation of fraudulent activity, etc.); 4) the customer has been informed about the possibility of disclosure for marketing or similar purposes through a prior communication and has not exercised the right to opt out; 5) the information is exchanged with reputable information reporting agencies to maximize the accuracy and security of such information; or 6) in the performance of bona fide corporate due diligence for merger or asset sales.
			</p><p>
			<b>Maintain customer privacy in business relationships with third parties.</b><br>
			At times, we rely on third parties to help us do business. Examples include check printers and processors. Each of these companies is bound by contract to honor these Privacy Principles. If personally identifiable customer information is provided to other third parties, we will require them to keep our customer information private and secure.
			</p><p>
			<b>Make our privacy principles and policies known to the customer.</b><br>
			We will always provide our customers with reasonable access to our privacy policy.
			</p><p>
			With the above stated privacy principles as a foundation, the policy language that follows is a detailed explanation of how and why we collect, use and share information.
