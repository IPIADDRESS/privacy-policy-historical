			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">This privacy policy describes how and why Zynaptiq GmbH (“Zynaptiq”, “we” or “us”) processes your personal data when you access or use any part of the Website&nbsp;<a href="http://zynaptiq.com/index.php" target="_blank">&nbsp;www.zynaptiq.com</a>&nbsp;(the “Website“), shop online, install, activate or use our software, communicate or interact with us in any other way. This privacy policy is meant to help you understand what data we may collect, under whch circumstances we collect it, why we collect it and what we do with it. You will also find information about how you can affect the processing of your personal data and what rights you have.
</p>
<h2>What is personal data?</h2>
<p class="bodytext">Personal data means any information relating to you that, directly or indirectly, may be used to identify you, for example your name and your e-mail address. Information such as your IP-number and your user behavior when using the Website may also be personal data.
</p>
<h2>Who is responsible for processing your personal data?</h2>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">When your personal data is being processed by us for our purposes, in the way set out in this Privacy Policy, Zynaptiq GmbH, registered with number HRB 208004 at Amtsgericht Hannover, is the data controller regarding such processing.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you have any questions about our processing of your personal data or your rights connected hereto, you can always contact us.
</p>
<h2>Which sources for personal data about you do we have, and which data do we receive from them?</h2>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Most of the personal data that we process about you is information that you have chosen to provide to us.<br>&nbsp;We gather such information about you when:</p><ul>&nbsp;	<li>You order a trial version of our software. We deliver download information per email, for which you must provide a valid address for an email account to which you have access. You must also select the operating system for which you wish to use the software. You may also optionally provide additional information such as your name, your preferred host application, and your main field of work. You may subscribe to our email newsletter when ordering a trial version.</li>&nbsp;	<li>You register your software. After purchasing a zynaptiq software product, you must register your software in order to receive download URLs as well as license activation codes; you can not use our software without registration. When you register your software, you must provide your name, a valid address for an email account to which you have access, as well as the registration code provided by your dealer. In addition, we log the IP address from which the registration was performed, along with a timestamp, and information about the browser and OS used to perform the registration.&nbsp;</li>&nbsp;	<li>You navigate this website; our content management system will create access log files that may contain information about your IP address, operating system, browser, the date and time of the access request, and the pages you visited. We rarely use this information; when we do, it typically relates mainly to evaluating website usability, functionality and security.</li>&nbsp;	<li>You contact us in any way (for example contacting our customer service or at social media channels). We may gather whatever information you provide to us voluntarily and thus assumedly with consent.&nbsp;</li>&nbsp;</ul><p class="bodytext">We receive such data about you from third parties when:</p><ul>&nbsp;<li>You navigate this website; our hosting services provider will create access log files that may contain information about your IP address, operating system, browser, the date and time of the access request, and the pages you visited.</li>&nbsp;<li>You purchase from our reseller partner Digital River, Inc., owners of the brand "eSellerate". eSellerate is a third-party reseller based outside of the EU/EEA, and subject to their own Privacy Policy which you should evaluate before making a purchase at <a href="http://cs.mycommerce.com/privacy-policy/esellerate" target="_blank">cs.mycommerce.com/privacy-policy/esellerate</a> . We administrate their Zynaptiq shop for them, and manage most related support issues. In order for us to be able to perform such administration, we receive transactional data relating to your purchase that consists of a purchaser's name, email address, billing address, payment method, date, time and IP address of purchase, order number, and similar data needed to provide warranty, facilitate returns, and provide information about order status.</li>&nbsp;<li>You activate your license for our software. To use our software – all license types, including full, NFR and trials – you must have an account with PACE Anti-Piracy, Inc., a third-party company based outside of the EU/EEA, also known as "iLok". This account is used to identify you as licensed user of and provide access to our software, and stores your software licenses for you (and us). You activate our software by adding a license file to your iLok account – our software will then verify its licensing status by querying your iLok account (when activating to HD or via cloud), or an attached iLok2 or iLok 3 USB key, for a valid license. In order for us to be able to adminsistrate your licenses, provide support, and generally implement our contractual obligations to you in context of your software license, PACE provides us with that part of your data which relates directly to your licenses to our software, such as Name, email address, IP Address, and a list of and status for your Zynaptiq licenses, as well as information about the name and OS of any computers you use with our licenses. Such account can be created at the third-party website www.ilok.com , which is owned and maintained by PACE Anti-Piracy, Inc. , and which is subject to their own Privacy Policy, which you should evaluate before registering an account, at https://www.ilok.com/#!privacy-policy, and https://www.ilok.com/#!terms-of-use. Also, as a convenience, our software's activation window provides the option to launch your browser and open the iLok.com website should you need to activate the software and not yet have an iLok account; please note that when cerating such an account at ilok.com, you are doing so at a third-party site and providing data to a third party, under the terms of their Privacy Policy and Terms Of Use.</li>&nbsp;<li>When you sign up for a survey, contest or campaign offer that we arrange together with our marketing partners; we may receive the information that you have chosen to provide to our partner with in such survey, contest or campaign offer.</li>&nbsp;</ul><h2>What do we do with your personal data and why do we do it?</h2>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">We process your personal data for different purposes. Below you can read more about why and how we process your personal data, what legal basis we have for the processing and more.
</p>
<h2>When you activate or have a Zynaptiq software license</h2>
<p class="bodytext">If you want to use any of our products, including trial versions, you will need to register with us. You must provide your name, a valid email address, and the Registration Code provided by your dealer. After registration, you will be entitled to 2nd level and up support, and will receive an Activation Code, which you can use to unlock the software. If you do not provide us with the personal data needed for registration, we cannot provide level 2+ support, nor an Activation Code. If you do not want to provide us with the information, you cannot use our products.<br>&nbsp;To use this Activation Code, you will also need an account with PACE Anti-Piracy, Inc., also known as "ilok". This account facilitates our copy protection, meaning that it is the basis of verifying licensing status and providing access to our software to you. Additionally, it is used by you and/or us to move activations between locations, transfer licenses, and more. Please see the ilok.com website to find out more about what data PACE requires and/or collects in context of such ilok account. If you do not have an iLok account, you can not use our products.</p><div class="policy-table"><p class="bodytext">&nbsp;	&nbsp;		&nbsp;		&nbsp;		&nbsp;		&nbsp;			&nbsp;			&nbsp;			&nbsp;		&nbsp;	&nbsp;</p><table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" bordercolor="black" class="contenttable"><tbody><tr><th colspan="3" style="text-align:left;
