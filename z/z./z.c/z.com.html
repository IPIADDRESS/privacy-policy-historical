		Glad you wanted to know more about our privacy philosophy.  No doubt, it’s pretty important to you.  It’s also important to us.   Z.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our audience members – you, our guests.  
		<p>
		We assure you that at no time will Z.com sell a guest’s personally identifiable private information  to a third party.  The purpose of Z.com gathering any information is to improve the overall Z experience  and and to give our sponsors better information about the type of people who visit our site.  Stop right there, you’re saying.  Are you going to give out my personal information to advertisers????  The answer is NO!  What we will do is supply sponsors with aggregate information, such as 22% of our guests are males between the ages of 18 and 24.
