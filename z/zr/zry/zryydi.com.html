        	<p>Effective data: May 25, 2018.</p>
        	<p>We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection,
                use and disclosure of the personal data and other information we receive from Publishers.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the
    same meanings as in our Terms of Use. By continuing to use the Site and/or Service after notice of
    changes has been sent to you, you are consenting to these changes.</p>

<p>You willingly provide us certain personal data, which we collect in order to allow you to benefit from
    the Site and/or Service functionalities. If you have any hesitation about providing such personal data to
    us or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and in our Terms of Use, you
    should not become a Publisher.</p>

<h3 class="static">The Site and Third Party Sites</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Site. The Site may contain links to third parties' sites which
    are not owned or controlled by the Provider. The Provider has no control over, and assumes no
    responsibility for, the content, privacy policies (if any), or practices of any third parties' sites. You
    acknowledge that you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the privacy policies (if any) of
    any third parties' sites you may access through this Site. By using this Site, you release the Provider
    from any and all liability arising from your use of any third parties' sites to which this Site may link.</p>

<p>Our primary goals in collecting your personal data are to provide and improve the Site and Service
    and the related features, to administer your subscription and to enable Publishers to enjoy and easily
    navigate the Site and Service. Below are the types and categories of information we collect.</p>

<h3 class="static">Personal Data Collected</h3>

<p>We collect your personal data in the following ways:</p>

<h3 class="static">Sign-up</h3>

<p>To use the Service you are required to provide the following information, which you recognize and
    expressly acknowledge are personal data allowing others, including the Provider, to identify you: first
    and last name, full address e-mail address, You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of any
    personal information you submit. Inaccurate information will affect the information you receive when
    using the Site and Service and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3 class="static">Log Data</h3>

<p>When you visit the Site our servers automatically record information about your use and your visit to
    the Site ("Log Data"). The Log Data may include information such as your computer Internet Protocol
    (IP) address, time and date of your requests, your browser type, what software you were using, the
    web page you were visiting immediately prior to visiting the Site, access times and dates, your
    location, mobile network information and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and
    analyze the use of the Site and for the Site's technical administration, to improve the Site's
    functionalities and Publisher-friendliness, and to better tailor it to the Publishers' needs.</p>

<h3 class="static">Cookies</h3>

<p>Like most sites, we use cookies and web log files to track the use of the Site. A cookie is a tiny data
    file which resides on your computer and allows the Provider to recognize you as a Publisher when you
    return to the Site using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow
    cookies, you may not be able to use the Site. Like the information you enter at subscription, cookies
    and log file data are used to customize your experience on the Site.</p>

<p>One type of cookie, known as a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Site.
    Session cookie expires after a short time or when you close your web browser.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Site may use local shared objects, commonly called a "flash cookies" for purposes such
    as storing Publishers’ preferences. You may manage or opt out of your flash cookies <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager06.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing Service to our Publishers, we may allow
    authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information
    provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable. If you would like more
    information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by
    third parties, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset
    your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your
    browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the
    Site. The Provider does not store personal data in the cookies.</p>

<h3 class="static">Web Beacons</h3>

<p>We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Publishers through the
    Site. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research
    firms.</p>

<p>To deliver these ads properly, we may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks
    within pages served by the Provider so the ad networks may provide anonymized, aggregated
    auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other
    sites.</p>

<p>Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad
    network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had
    requested a web page from their site.</p>

<p>These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other sites as a
    substitute for random, irrelevant ads. The Provider does not provide personal data to any advertiser or
    any other third parties.</p>

<h3 class="static">Log files, IP and Information About Your Computer</h3>

<p>Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Site we automatically receive
    the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave the Site.
    We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to
    access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are
    using, e-mail patterns, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall
    trends to help us improve the Site. The linkage between your IP address and your personal data is not
    shared with third parties without your prior consent or except when allowed or required by law.</p>

<h3 class="static">Communications</h3>

<p>The Provider will communicate with you through e-mail and notices posted on the Site or through
    other means available through the service, including text and other forms of messaging. If we send
    any communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications
    subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with
    any such access (including text messaging charges for messages to your mobile device). Please be
    aware that you will always receive certain e-mails from the Provider related to the proper functioning of
    the Service.</p>

<h3 class="static">Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>

<p>The Provider takes the privacy of Publishers very seriously. Thus, we do not sell, rent, or otherwise
    provide your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personal
    data with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide specific services or information.
    Unless you have agreed to it, these third parties do not retain, share, or store any personal data
    except to provide these services and they are bound by confidentiality agreements which limit their
    use of such information.</p>

<p>We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the use of the Site to third parties for such
    purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on
    the Site.</p>

<h3 class="static">Teaming with Third Parties</h3>

<p>The Provider allows other companies to place advertisements on the Site. These companies use
    technology to deliver advertisements you see on the Site directly to your browser. In doing so, they
    may automatically receive your IP address. Other companies that place advertising on the Site may
    have the ability to use cookies and/or web beacons to collect information, including information about
    your use of the Site. We do not control the processes that advertisers use to collect the information.
    However, IP addresses, cookies and web beacons alone are not considered as personal data and
    generally cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines. Therefore, advertisers and others
    whose advertisements or content may appear on the Site generally will not know who you are, unless
    you provide additional information to them, by responding to an advertisement, by entering into an
    agreement with them, or by some other means.</p>

<h3 class="static">Legal Disclaimer</h3>

<p>The Provider cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce
    and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law
    enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate
    to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation a court action), to protect the
    property and rights of the Provider or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or
    to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.</p>

<p>We provide the representations and information in this section in compliance with European privacy
    laws, in particular the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They are specific to
    persons located in EEA countries or Switzerland, so please don’t rely on the below, if you’re not in one
    of those countries.</p>

<p>If you are a visitor from the European Territories, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal
    data described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the personal information concerned and the
    specific context in which we collect it. "European Territories" mean the European Economic Area and
    Switzerland. For the purpose of this Privacy Notice, the term "European Territories" shall continue to
    include the United Kingdom, even after the United Kingdom leaves the European Economic Area
    following Brexit.</p>

<p>However, we will normally collect personal data from you where the processing is in our legitimate
    business interests to, for example, administer our platforms and services and fulfil our contractual
    obligations as a service provider.</p>

<p>In some cases we may collect and process personal data based on consent. To the extent our clients
    and Advertising Partners need to collect and share, or allow us to facilitate collection and sharing of
    personal data to enable our services, it is the responsibility of these parties to provide necessary
    privacy notices and obtain required consent(s).</p>

<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect
    and use your personal information, including if you would like to better understand how our legitimate
    interests to process your data are balanced against your data protection rights and freedoms, then
    please contact us using the Contact Form</p>

<h3 class="static">Disclosures to Others</h3>

<p>The Provider may also disclose your personal data and other information you provide, to another third
    party as part of reorganization or a sale of the assets of the Provider's division or company. Any third
    party to which we transfer or sell our assets will have the right to continue to use the personal data
    and other information that you provide to us.</p>

<h3 class="static">Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>We may share aggregated information that does not include personal data and we may otherwise
    disclose non-identifying information and Log Data to third parties for industry analysis, demographic
    profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain
    your personal data.</p>

<h3 class="static">International Transfer</h3>

<p>Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers and servers located outside of
    your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as
    protective as those in your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your
    submission of such information represents your consent to such transfer.</p>

<h3 class="static">Links to Other Sites</h3>

<p>Our Site contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner
    ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to those third
    parties' websites. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of
    advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third
    party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not
    exercise control over third parties' websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or
    other files on your computer, collect personal data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites
    follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal data you submit to them. We
    encourage you to read the privacy policies (if any) or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>

<h3 class="static">Accessing and Changing Your Information</h3>

<p>You can review the information you provided us with and make any desired changes to them at any
    time. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, the Provider may, for a
    time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database. We
    take your rights seriously and encourage you to use them if you deem this to be appropriate. You may
    exercise these rights by emailing us using the following <a href="/contact/contact">Contact Form</a>.</p>

<h3 class="static">Your Obligations</h3>

<p>As a Publisher, you have certain obligations imposed by applicable law and regulations:</p>

<ol class="static">
	<li>You must, at all times, respect the terms and conditions of the then-current Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights which may belong to third parties.</li>
	<li>You must not download, upload or otherwise disseminate any information which may be deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, racist or xenophobic.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any violation of these obligations may lead to the restriction, suspension or termination of your use of the Site and/or Service by the Provider, as we take these principles seriously and consider them to be the basis on which the Publishers adhere to the Site and the Service which it offers.</p>

<h3 class="static">Security</h3>

<p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity
    of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable laws related to
    security breach notification) to you via e-mail or conspicuous posting on the Site in the most expedient
    time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with: (i) the legitimate needs of
    law enforcement; or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the
    reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>

<p>We apply technical, administrative and organizational security measures to protect the data we collect
    against accidental or unlawful destruction and loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in
    particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against other
    unlawful forms of processing.</p>

<h3 class="static">Data Retention Policy</h3>

<p>We retain personal data we collect directly for targeting purposes for no more than 12 months, after
    which time we employ measures to delete it. However for identifiable data that we hold on behalf of an
    Advertiser such as their email address list, we will retain until the Advertiser asks us to delete it.</p>

<p>Personal data collected for other purposes is held no longer than necessary for our business purposes
    but is anonymized. For example, we retain anonymized impression and click data to ensure we can
    meet auditing requirements related to services provided or to meet legal requirements.</p>

<h3 class="static">Additional data protection rights for EEA residents</h3>

<p>If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can contact
    us using the Contact Form.</p>

<p>You can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your
    personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the Contact Form.</p>

<p>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can
    withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any
    processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal
    information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
