                register for an account or use our Service.
                </li>

                <li>
                Messages and User Content. We may also retain any messages you send to
                us and may collect information you provide when you post reviews or comments on

                <li>Friend Referrals.
                If you invite a friend to use our Service, we will collect that person’s

                invitation and to track the success of our invitation service. Unless the invitee becomes a registered user
                of the Service, we do not use the invitee’s email address for marketing
                purposes, and we do not share the invitee’s email address with third parties
                other than our service providers. The

                from our database at <a href="mailto:support@zesty.com">support@zesty.com</a>.</li>
                </ul>

                directly with you. From time to time, we
                may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions, and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email
                messages, you will be given the option to opt-out or change your
                preferences. We also use your
                information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification,
                order confirmations and tracking information, change or updates to features of
                the Service, technical and security notices).
                You may not opt-out of Service-related e-mails.

                <p><strong>Opting Out of Collection of Tracking Data and
                Online Advertising:</strong> The only
                way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through
                cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your
                browser. Please refer to your browser’s
                technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies,
                and other tracking/recording tools. (To
                learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and related technologies, you

                technologies through browser settings. </p>

                <p>Note that disabling cookies on your browser
                prevents Zesty or our business partners from tracking your browser’s activities

                features available through the Service.</p>

                you would like to learn more about the collection of data through tracking
