                <p>"Zest" is a trading name of Chalk Farm Ventures Private Limited (referred to, including its affiliates, as "we" or "us"). We are the data controller. Throughout this Privacy Policy "you" means the customer.</p>

                <p>We believe you deserve the utmost respect when it comes to the security and use of your personal information, so we have described how we look after your information as clearly as possible.</p>

                <p>Our Privacy Policy applies from when you register with us. Our Privacy Policy is regularly reviewed to make sure that we continue to serve your privacy interests. We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy and these changes will be posted on our website. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. We are committed to keeping your personal information confidential and will only give it to others for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p>If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us on <a href="mailto:help@zestmoney.in">help@zestmoney.in</a></p>

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>We recognise how important it is to protect and manage the information you share with us. We protect that information using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology and by limiting employee access on a need-to-know basis. We store information in encrypted form on computers and control access via secure web pages. We employ firewalls and other security technologies to protect our servers from external attack.</p>
                <p>
                  Our security systems meet or exceed industry standards and we are constantly monitoring internet developments to ensure our systems evolve as required. However, sadly, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
                </p>
