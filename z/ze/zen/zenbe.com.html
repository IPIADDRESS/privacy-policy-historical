<h4>Last updated: 27 August 2007</h4>

<p>We at Zenbe have very clear objectives regarding privacy. There is little data on the internet that is more private or sensitive than your personal email. Your Zenbe data, whether created or received by you, is yours and yours alone, and will only be collected, used, and shared as outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Information we collect and how we use it:</h3>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong> – Cookies are small files sent to your computer. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. If you select the "remember me" option when you login, Zenbe uses a persistent cookie to remember your computer and help you login faster from that computer.  If you change your mind, you can remove persistent cookies by following your web browsers directions. Zenbe also uses session cookies to manage your connection while you are logged in, which are temporary and will be eliminated after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of Zenbe may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>

<p><strong>Linked accounts</strong> – Zenbe is intended to make it easier for you to manage your multiple email, agendas, and other forms of  online personal information.  When you  provide Zenbe with user name and password information to these other accounts, Zenbe will keep that information in an industry standard secure format. Zenbe will use the login information you provide to collect your data from those accounts, and keep it securely stored along with your other Zenbe data. If you use a function labeled "Subscribe", then Zenbe will automatically update that information, until you unsubscribe or change your user name and password on that account. If you use a function labeled "Import", the Zenbe will only collect the information once. </p>

<p><strong>Information you provide</strong> – When you sign up for Zenbe, you provide information, such as your name, user name, password, and zip code. Zenbe uses this information to provide services to you, and it is not shared with any entity outside of Zenbe.</p>

<p><strong>From your web browser</strong> – When you use Zenbe, we record and maintain a log of requests sent by your browser to our web servers. This information includes information such as the URL that was used to view our website, your PC’s Internet Protocol address, and the time of the request.  We may use different types of technologies to collect this information, such as log files and GIFs.  The non-personally identifiable information we collect may be used to improve the quality of our services— for example, by diagnosing service or technology problems, or assessing and maintaining security.  We may also conduct research on the non-personally identifiable information we collect to determine user demographics, interests, and behavior.</p>

<h3>Information Sharing</h3>

<p>Zenbe will not rent or sell your information to others.</p>

<p>Zenbe may share your personally identifiable information with entities outside of Zenbe in the following limited circumstances:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If we have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</li>
	<li>to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. These parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with our Policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
	<li>if we have a good faith belief that  disclosure of  the information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Zenbe, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
</ol>

<p>We may share aggregate, anonymous, non-personal information with interested third parties in order to help them understand usage of the Zenbe service.  We may also provide your non-personally identifiable information to contractors so that they can perform services for us. Such information does not identify you individually, nor could it ever be used singly or in aggregate to identify you.</p>

<p>Zenbe may provide links to third-party websites.  Our Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party websites.  You should consult the privacy policy of any other website you visit from links on the Zenbe service.</p>

<h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>

<p>Zenbe uses industry standard measures to protect the security of your information.  This is not a guarantee that your information may not be accessed or disclosed by a breach of our systems.  We take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p>

<h3>Your Choices About Your Information</h3>

<p>You may choose not to submit personally identifiable information through Zenbe, in which case Zenbe may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information and preferences at any time by logging in to your account.   You can review and correct the information about you that Zenbe keeps on file by contacting us directly at <a href="mailto:support@zenbe.com">support@zenbe.com</a>. </p>

<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>

<p>Zenbe does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Zenbe. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@zenbe.com">privacy@zenbe.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.  You are bound by changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the site after those changes have been posted. </p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@zenbe.com">privacy@zenbe.com</a>.</p>

<p>If Zenbe becomes involved in an acquisition, merger, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
