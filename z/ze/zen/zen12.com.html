 Our Commitment To Privacy</p>
 <p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide 
 this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can 
 make about the way your information is collected and used.</p><br>
 <div class="sptextborder"></div>
 <p style="padding-bottom:18px;color:#313131;font-weight:bold">The Information 
 We Collect</p>
 <p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the various 
 websites owned by Inspire3. On some pages, you can order products, make 
 requests, and register to receive materials.</p>
	<p>When subscribing to receive material by e-mail, the types of personal 
	information collected are typically:</p>
	<p>Name<br>
	E-mail address</p>
	<p>When purchasing a product, the types of personal information collected 
	are typically:</p>
<p>Name<br>
E-mail address<br>
Postal address</p>
	<p>Your credit card details may also be taken, simply for the purpose of 
	billing your card. If this is taken, it is immediately and securely passed 
	to our payments provider, SWREG Inc.</p>
	<p>For your safety and protection, your credit card information is not 
	stored on our servers. Our payment gateway provider, SWREG Inc, keeps this 
	information encrypted and secure on your behalf.</p>
	<p>We may store an authorisation tag on our system, which can be used with 
	our payment gateway provider to rebill your card. However your actual card 
	details are never stored directly.</p>
	<br>
<div class="sptextborder"></div>
 <p style="padding-bottom:18px;color:#313131;font-weight:bold">The Way We Use 
 Information</p>
 <p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete that order. We 
 may also provide this information to an outside party to help with shipping for 
 an order.</p>
 <p>We may also provide your information to an outside party to call you 
 following a purchase, to check on your progress, and offer you coaching 
 services.</p>
	<p>We may share your name and e-mail address with an affiliate, if you 
	purchased through an affiliate link. This helps the affiliate keep track of 
	promotional activities, and the affiliate may attempt to reasonably follow 
	up with you, with you having the option to opt-out.</p>
 <p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses 
 are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>
 <p>You can register with our website if you would like to receive our various 
 newsletters, as well as updates on new products and services. Information you 
 submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the 
 registration form and confirm your address by verified double opt-in.</p>
 <p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our 
 website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser 
 that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y 
 number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we 
 would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>
 <p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information 
 provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without 
 also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such 
 unrelated uses.</p><br>

 <p style="padding-bottom:18px;color:#313131;font-weight:bold">Our Commitment To

 correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, 
 electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information

 <p style="padding-bottom:18px;color:#313131;font-weight:bold">Our Commitment To 
 Children's Privacy</p>
 <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that 
 reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we 
 actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract 
 anyone under 13.</p><br>
 <div class="sptextborder"></div>
 <p style="padding-bottom:18px;color:#313131;font-weight:bold">How You Can 
 Access Or Correct Your Information</p>
 <p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect 
 online and maintain by writing to us and making an official request. We use 
 this procedure to better safeguard your information.</p>
 <p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information 
 by sending us a request that credibly shows error.</p>
 <p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to 
 verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
