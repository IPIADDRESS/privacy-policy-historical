  		 	<h4>Website Visitors</h4>
<p>Like most website operators, Zenphoto.org collects
non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of
each visitor request. Zenphoto.org's purpose in collecting
non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
Zenphoto.org's visitors use its website. From time to time,
zenphoto.org may release non-personally-identifying information in
the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage
of its website.<br>
Zenphoto.org also collects potentially personally-identifying
information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Zenphoto.org
does not use such information to identify its visitors, however,
and does not disclose such information, other than under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
information, as described below.</p>
<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
<p>Certain visitors to Zenphoto.org's websites choose to interact
with Zenphoto.org in ways that require Zenphoto.org to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
information that Zenphoto.org gathers depends on the nature of the
interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums or
Trac ticket system to provide a username and email address. In each
case, Zenphoto.org collects such information only insofar as is
necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's
interaction with Zenphoto.org. Zenphoto.org does not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described below.
And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging
in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>
<p>Zenphoto.org may collect statistics about the behavior of
visitors to its websites. For instance, Zenphoto.org may reveal how
many downloads a particular version go. However, Zenphoto.org does
not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
described below.</p>
<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
<p>Zenphoto.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know
that information in order to process it on Zenphoto.org's behalf or
to provide services available at Zenphoto.org's websites, and (ii)
that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
outside of your home country; by using Zenphoto.org's websites, you
consent to the transfer of such information to them. Zenphoto.org
will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described
above, Zenphoto.org discloses potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information only when required to do so
by law, or when Zenphoto.org believes in good faith that disclosure
is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
Zenphoto.org, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a
registered user of a Zenphoto.org website and have supplied your
email address, Zenphoto.org may occasionally send you an email to
tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep
you up to date with what's going on with Zenphoto.org and our
products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via
one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it
in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help
us support other users. Zenphoto.org takes all measures reasonably
necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information.</p>
