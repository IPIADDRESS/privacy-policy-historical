called server log files), is collected: - type and version of the
browser you use - operating system - websites that linked you to
our site (referrer URL) - websites that you visit - date and time
of your visit - your Internet Protocol (IP) address. This anonymous
data is stored separately from any personal information you may
have provided, thereby making it impossible to connect it to any
particular person. The data is used for statistical purposes in
order to improve our website and services.</p>
<h4>Purpose of Registering</h4>
<p>We offer you the opportunity to sign up for our website. The
information entered when signing up, as shown in the registration
form</p>
<p><strong>User name and email address</strong></p>
<p>is collected and stored solely for use by our website. When
signing up for our website, we also store your IP address
(anyonmized, first two numbers only) and the date and time you
registered. This serves to protect us in the event a third party
improperly and without your knowledge makes use of your data to
sign up for our site.&nbsp;None of this information is transferred
to third parties. Nor is any of this information matched to any
information that may be collected by other components of our
website.</p>
<h4>Contacting Us</h4>
<p>On our website we offer you the opportunity to contact us,
either by email and/or by using a contact form. In such event,
information provided by the user is stored for the purpose of
facilitating communications with the user. No data is transferred
to third parties. Nor is any of this information matched to any
information that may be collected by other components of our
website.</p>
<h4>Posting Comments</h4>
<p>On our website we offer you the opportunity to post comments
about individual articles. For this purpose, the IP address
(anyonmized, first two numbers only) of the user/internet
connection subscriber is stored. This information is stored for our
security in the event the author through his/her comments infringes
against third party rights and/or unlawful content is entered.
Consequently, we have a direct interest in the author’s stored
data, particularly since we may be potentially liable for such
violations. No data is transferred to third parties. Nor is any of
this information matched to any information that may be collected
by other components of our website.</p>
<h4>Use of reCAPTCHA</h4>
<p>In order to protect input forms on our site, we use the
“reCAPTCHA” service of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter "Google." By means of this
service it can be distinguished whether the corresponding input is
of human origin or is created improperly by automated machine
processing.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, the referrer URL, the IP address, the
behaviour of the website visitors, information about the operating
system, browser and length of stay, cookies, display instructions
and scripts, user input behaviour and mouse movements in the
“reCAPTCHA” checkbox are conveyed to “Google.”</p>
<p>Google uses the information obtained, among other things, to
digitize books and other printed matter as well as to optimize
services such as Google Street View and Google Maps (e.g. house
number and street name recognition).</p>
<p>The IP address provided as part of “reCAPTCHA” is not merged
with other data from Google unless you are logged into your Google
Account at the time the "reCAPTCHA" plug-in is used. If you want to
prevent this transmission and storage of data by “Google” about you
and your behaviour on our website, you must log out of “Google”
before you visit our site or before using the reCAPTCHA
plug-in.</p>
<p>The use of the “reCAPTCHA” service is according to the Google
Terms of Use:&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Use of the web analysis service PIWIK</h4>
<p>Our website uses the web analysis service PIWIK. To carry out
this analysis, PIWIK uses cookies. Cookies are small text files
that are stored to your computer and provide analysis of your use
of the site. The information generated by these cookies, such as
time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including
your IP address, are transmitted to our PIWIK server and stored
there. As part of this process, you IP address is immediately
anonymized so that you as user remain anonymous to us. The
information generated by the cookie about your use of this site is
not transferred to third parties. You can prevent cookies from
being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software
accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may
not be able to make full use of all the functions of our
website.</p>
<p>Should you be unwilling to have this data about your use of the
site stored and analyzed, you may at any time subsequently withdraw
your consent to it being stored and used with a click of the mouse.
A so-called opt-out cookie is then placed on your browser, and as a
result Piwik will no longer collect any data on your
visits.&nbsp;Please be aware that, should you delete cookies from
your browser settings, the opt-out cookie from PIWIK may also be
deleted and will need to be reactivated.</p>

<h4>Use of YouTube components with enhanced data protection
mode</h4>
<p>On our website we use components (videos) of YouTube, LLC 901
Cherry Ave., 94066 San Bruno, CA, USA, a company belonging to
Google Inc., Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043,
USA.</p>
<p>To this end, we use the “ - enhanced data protection mode - ”
option provided by YouTube.</p>
<p>When you display a page that has an embedded video, a connection
will be made to the YouTube server and the content will appear on
the website via a communication to your browser.</p>
<p>According to the information provided by YouTube, in “ -
enhanced data protection mode -”, data is only transferred to the
YouTube server, in particular which of our websites you have
visited, if you watch the video. If you are logged onto YouTube at
the same time, this information will be matched to your YouTube
member account. You can prevent this from happening by logging out
of your member account before visiting our website.</p>
<p>Further information about data protection by YouTube is provided
by Google under the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/</a></p>
<h4>Use of Vimeo components</h4>
<p>We use Vimeo components on our site.&nbsp; Vimeo is a service of
Vimeo LCC, 555 West 18th Street, New York, New York 10011, USA.
Whenever you visit our website, which is equipped with such a
component, this component causes the browser you are using to
download a corresponding display of the Vimeo component. When you
visit our site and are at the same time logged into Vimeo, Vimeo
recognizes by means of the information collected by the component,
which specific page you are visiting and assigns this information
to your personal account at Vimeo. If, for example, you click on
the “Play” button or make comments, this information will be
conveyed to your personal user account at Vimeo and stored there.
In addition, the information that you have visited our site will be
passed on to Vimeo. This is done regardless of whether you click on
the component/comment or not.</p>
<p>If you want to prevent this transmission and storage of data by
Vimeo about you and your behaviour on our website, you must log out
of Vimeo before you visit our site. Vimeo’s Privacy Policy provides
more detailed information concerning this, in particular regarding
the collection and use of data by Vimeo: <a href="https://vimeo.com/privacy">https://vimeo.com/privacy</a></p>
<h4>Use of affilinet tracking cookies</h4>
<p>Our website employs affilinet tracking cookies in order to
correctly record sales and/or leads. Cookies are small text files
that are saved to your computer when you visit a website. These
affilinet tracking cookies do not store personal data of any kind.
Instead, it only collects the identification number of the
intermediary partner as well as the reference number of the
advertising material that was clicked on by the visitor to the
website. This information is required in order to process the
payment transaction between the website operator and the
advertiser. The partner identification number serves to designate
the intermediary partner to which a commission is to be paid once a
transaction has been concluded. You can prevent cookies from being
installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software
accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may
not be able to make full use of all the functions of our
website.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Information/Cancellation/Deletion</h3>
<p>On the basis of the Federal Data Protection Act, you may contact
us at no cost if you have questions relating to the collection,
processing or use of your personal information, if you wish to
request the correction, blocking or deletion of the same, or if you
wish to cancel explicitly granted consent. Please note that you
have the right to have incorrect data corrected or to have personal
data deleted, where such claim is not barred by any legal
obligation to retain this data.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ratgeberrecht.eu/leistungen/muster-datenschutzerklaerung.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sample Data Privacy
Policy Statement</a> provided by the <a href="https://www.ratgeberrecht.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Law Offices of Weiß &amp; Partner</a></p>
<h4>Appendix: Contributor pages</h4>
<p>We always create such a page for you if an extension or theme is
listed on our site or if you contribtuted any significant fix/patch
to a release. We differ three main categories that are listed on
our <a href="/pages/about-us">"About us" section</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/pages/zenphoto-team"><strong>Official and active team
members</strong></a> (this traditionally includes our regular
translators)</li>
<li><a href="/pages/former-team-members"><strong>Former team
members</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="/pages/contributors"><strong>Contributors</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course we don’t expose any data or info you haven’t published
yourself in public already via your contributions like on GitHub,
our forum or your third party theme or plugin itself. Needless to
say, you can request changes or even have your page removed at any
time. We don’t and won’t use your data for anything else.</p>
<p>This is what we list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Screen name:</strong>&nbsp;The alias or screen name you
appeared to us via e.g. the forum, GitHub or&nbsp;our&nbsp;your
third party theme or plugin itself.</li>
<li><strong>Real name:</strong>&nbsp;If we know that via your
contributions or website.</li>
<li><strong>Website:&nbsp;</strong>If we know it. Can be a GitHub
page or social media profile as well.</li>
<li><strong>Short description:</strong>&nbsp;Only used for active
or former team members who provided it themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally we automatically list all&nbsp;<strong>plugins,
themes or releases</strong>&nbsp;you ever contributed to and that
have entries on our site. We can do that because all your entries
are assigned by a special tag <em>author_&lt;screen name&gt;</em>.
You can see that tag below each extension entry (on themes we don't
list tags specifcally).</p>
<p>We have done that for quite some time already to show the "More
by author" below each theme or extension entry.&nbsp;<em>&lt;screen
name&gt;</em>&nbsp;is also the name of your page in the url
(titlelink).&nbsp;Also, every theme or extension entry now has a
box that lists its authors and links to each profile page.</p>
<p>Again, the Zenphoto team will not use the information you enter
for anything else than what you see:</p>
<ol>
<li>Showcase and credit your contributions.</li>
<li>Gather general statistics of contributions&nbsp;to satisfy our
and your curiosity.</li>
<li>Easier maintenance of author credits as we don’t have to change
multiple entries if a user name or website link changes.</li>
<li>You will never get advertisement mass mails or anything
else.</li>
<li>We will never give your data to third parties or use it for
commercial purposes.</li>
</ol>
