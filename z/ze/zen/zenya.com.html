    <h2>Privacy</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns push-two pull-two">
        <h4 class="subhead"></h4>          
        <p></p><p>Zenya (the “Site”) is owned and operated worldwide by Info.com Limited, a UK regstered Limited Liability Company ("Info.com", “we”, “us”).</p>

<p>We are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. Personal Information means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address, an email address or other contact information.</p>

<p>Your privacy and the safeguarding of your personal information are very important to us. To better protect your privacy, we adhere to industry best privacy principles with respect to the data collection practices on our web site. As part of our commitment to clearly and readily disclose our data collection practices, we provide this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used on this Site. This Privacy Policy applies to the information collected or used in connection with this Site and in connection with our services available including Subscription Services, API tools and services, sub-domains and software available for download. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to enable you to understand how we collect and use information relating to you.</p>

<p>By using our Site, Subscription Services and/or API tools and services, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this policy now and as amended by us. This processing entails the use of cookies or tags (defined in section 2.3 below) on a computer or using information in any way including (but not limited to) the collection, storage, deletion, use, combining and disclosing information, all of which will take place in the United States. If you reside outside of the US, your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the US and processed and stored in the US under US privacy standards. By visiting our Site or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions, comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us at privacy@zenya.com.</p>

<p>1. Consent and Modification<br>

</p><p>Changes to our Privacy Policy are made from time to time by updating the content of the Site and you are advised to reference this policy regularly for any changes.</p>

<p>If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Site.</p>

<p>2. Receipt and Collection of Information</p>

<p>We receive and/or collect information from you in the following ways:</p>

<p>2.1. General Access to the Site</p>

<p>We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to general information available on our Site. If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you may be required to become a registered user and to submit certain personally identifiable information to us.</p>

<p>2.2. Purchases </p>

<p>If you choose to use a service or product from us (including a free trial),we will require sufficient information from you to be able to provide that service or product. Such information could include a credit card number and related account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data . We may also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We may use the tools, software or services of third-party service providers to process transactions on our behalf (but we require that these parties too provide a Privacy Policy). All information of this nature is maintained by us in a secure database and transmitted across the Internet from you to us using secured transmission encryption. Except as set forth herein, we will not share your financial Personal Information with any third person or entity.</p>

<p>We may provide you, via the Site, with the opportunity to contact us, receive a newsletter or participate in conferences, webinars, or special promotional or other programs (collectively "Events"). In order to participate in any of these Events, you will be required to provide certain Personal Information which may include your name, company, job title, address, email address, and phone number.</p>

<p>2.3. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</p>

<p>Cookies</p>

<p>Some of our Site pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that is transferred to your computer that may be used, for example, to collect information about Site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Site user. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and with and any services or Promotions we provide via the Site including our Subscription Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve usability and performance of the Site. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. You may block cookies, delete existing cookies or ask to be prompted before accepting a cookie from this Site and any web sites you visit by adjusting the appropriate setting on your browser. Please consult your browser’s Help tools to learn how to do this. If you block or delete "cookies" you may find the usefulness of our Site to be impaired. Please note that blocking cookies is a global setting and will apply to any web site you visit and not just our Site.</p>

<p>Tags</p>

<p>In addition to cookies, we implement tags on our Site for tracking purposes. A tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on a web page also known as “tracking pixels”, “pixel tags”, “clear GIFs” or “web beacons.” Tags are used to monitor the activity of a web site and are not typically visible to the user. We use third parties to assist us in carrying out and measuring the effectiveness of our Site and external advertising campaigns. Our tags do not enable third parties to collect your Personal Information. Rather, when you visit the Site, these tags will direct your browser to these third parties who may thereby set or read a cookie on your computer and collect information about your visit. This information may include your IP address (unique identifier of your local computer), cookie ID, elements of the Site that are viewed and/or clicked, referring site, information on searches you perform, time spent on pages on the Site, date/time information and other statistics that might help us improve our site design and content in an effort to serve you and your needs in the future.</p>

<p>2.4. Log Files</p>

<p>Like many other websites, this Site may make use of log files. The information inside the log files includes the IP address from which you access the Site, the type of browser and operating system you use to access the Site, the date and time you access the Site, the pages you visit, and the addresses of pages from where you followed a link to the Site. We may use such information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement around the Site, and gather demographic information. Such information is not linked to any information that is Personal Information, with the exception of the IP address which might be used to identify spamming attempts.</p>

<p>2.5. Personal Information Collected - Order History</p>

<p>With the exception of credit card info, we store the information from your order history to allow us to provide you with accurate data for purchasing and reporting purposes, track issues or refer to a previous order to help provide some customer service. You may elect to have your information completely removed from this system by e-mailing us at privacy@zenya.com with your request.</p>

<p>3. Publicly Available Information</p>

<p>Any information, video, image, data, text, documents, or other content posted at your direction onto a public area of the Site, such as Magento Forum, becomes publicly published content and will be available to all users of that public area of the Site, even if such content contains Personal Information. Please note that if you publish your contact information, you may receive unsolicited messages from users and visitors to the Site. We encourage you to publish only information you are sure you want to be accessible to anyone.</p>

<p>4. The Way We Use Personal Information</p>

<p>If you submit Personal Information to us through the Site:</p>

<p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, Info.com will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties.</p>

<p>We will use your Personal Information to improve our services to you, to contact you and to identify and authenticate your access to the Site’s services that you are authorized to access.</p>

<p>We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.</p>

<p>We may transfer your Personal Information within Info.com or Info.com’s third-party service providers, but only to provide services on the Site or to you. This information may be transferred to other countries around the world. We may also provide Personal Information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We may also use your email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding our services. You may choose not to receive emails of this type by sending a single email with the subject "BLOCK" to info@zenya.com. Please note that the email must come from the email account you wish to block.</p>

<p>We may disclose your Personal Information or any information you submitted via the Site and its services if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce our Terms of Service including investigations of potential violations thereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues, or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Magento, its users, yourself or the public.</p>

<p>Info.com does not provide or sell the names and addresses of our customers or site users to outside companies.</p>

<p>5. The Way We Use Anonymous Information</p>

<p>We may use Anonymous Information (as defined below), or disclose it to third party service providers, to improve our services and enhance your experience with the Site and its services. "Anonymous Information" means information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information about the use of our Site and services.</p>

<p>6. Choice</p>

<p>You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to Info.com. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit many parts of the Site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.</p>

<p>7. Access/Accuracy</p>

<p>To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, Info.com wishes to maintain accurate and complete Personal Information. If you have an Account, you may log-in to your personal profile at any time and add information, delete information or correct any incorrect information we have. If you do not have an Account and you would like to correct a material inaccuracy in your Personal Information that we may be storing, you may submit an access request by sending an email to info@zenya.com. Your email should include adequate details of your request and also show the subject of "Access Request". We will provide initial responses to access requests within a reasonable period of time.</p>

<p>8. Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites</p>

<p>Our Site may use a reputable third party to present or serve advertisements that you may see at our Site. These third party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, clear gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>9. Links to Other Sites</p>

<p>Our Site contains links to other sites. Other sites may also reference or link to our Site. Our linking to another web site is in no way an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party web sites. These other web sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other web sites you visit.</p>

<p>10. Children's Privacy</p>

<p>The Site is not intended for or structured to attract children under the age of 18. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 18 years of age. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at info@zenya.com. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will remove such information from our files.</p>

<p>11. In the Event of Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy</p>

<p>In the event that Info.com is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, or used. In any of the circumstances described in this paragraph, the information will be subject to the privacy policy of the purchaser or assignee.</p>

<p>12. Security</p>

<p>We employ advanced administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on the Site, you can contact us at info@info.com.</p>

<p>We will disclose any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>

<p>13. Commitment</p>

<p>Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and accordingly we are constantly evolving the Site to meet these demands. If you have any comments, concerns, complaints or questions regarding our Privacy Policy or the Site, please contact us at info@zenya.com.</p><p></p>
