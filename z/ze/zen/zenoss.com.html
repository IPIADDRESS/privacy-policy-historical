            <p>The intent of this privacy policy is to disclose Zenoss privacy
practices, whether you are a casual browser of our website, or a
community member who chooses to interact actively with us through our
website, use our software, or receive email from us.</p>
<h3>What information do we collect from casual website browsers?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> Zenoss does not collect personally-identifying
information from visitors to our website unless the visitor has
volunteered personally-identifying information, as described below in
the "Active Community Members" and "Interactive Product Users"
sections. But, like most website operators, Zenoss does collect
non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
and servers typically make available, such as the visitor's Internet
Protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider,
operating system, language preference, referring page, exit page,
clickstream data, and the date and time of each visitor request. We may
use this non-personally identifying information to create a profile or
log of your preferences, but we do not tie information in this file to
any of your personally identifying information which we may have.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Does the Zenoss website use Cookies?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> A cookie is a string of information that a website
stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides
to the website each time the visitor returns. Zenoss' website may use
both session ID cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and

<h3>Does the Zenoss website or Zenoss emails use clear gifs?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> We may use clear gifs, which are tiny graphics with
a unique identifier that track online movements of website visitors and
inform us what content on our site is most effective. Clear gifs are
embedded invisibly on Web pages and HTML-based emails and are about the
size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the
information gathered by website clear gifs to our customers' personally
identifiable information, although we may link that information to your
IP address.</p>
  <p> We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based
emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This
allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the
effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out
of these emails, please see "How can you access or correct your
personally-identifying information?"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What information do we collect from active community members?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> Some features of the Zenoss website are available to
community members only upon registration, which may require the
disclosure of personally-identifying information. The amount and type
of information that Zenoss gathers from those members depends on the
nature of the feature. For example, those who wish to receive emails
from Zenoss must provide their name and email address, those who wish
to post content to certain portions of the Zenoss website are asked to
provide usernames that identify that content as having been posted by a
particular member, members who wish to contribute code must provide
their name and contact information and sign a Contributor Agreement,
and those who wish to apply for a job must provide their name, address
and phone number. Should Zenoss choose to sell software or services on
its website, purchasers will be asked to provide us with even more
information, including billing and shipping addresses and credit card
or similar information. If any feature of the Zenoss website or
software requires the use of a password, that feature may not be
accessible without the password.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What information do we collect from interactive product users?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> Certain Zenoss products contain features that
report, or that permit users to report, the user's usage patterns and
problems - whether caused by Zenoss' software, third party software, or
third-party websites - to Zenoss. The reports generated by these
features typically include non-personally-identifying information such
as the configuration of the user's computer and the code running at the
time a problem or communication occurred, and the number and type of
servers being managed by the software. Some of these features give
users the option of providing personally-identifying information,
though none of these features require it. For example, Zenoss software
may include a "call home" feature that automatically and periodically
checks the Zenoss website for available software updates. Zenoss
analyzes the information provided by these interactive product features
to develop a better understanding of how its products are performing
and being used.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>With whom might we share collected information?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> The information that we collect is generally used
for internal purposes, such as fulfilling your requests for products or
information, permitting access to features of our website, enabling
customer support, responding to your inquiries, compiling usage
statistics regarding the Zenoss website, analyzing visitor preferences
regarding our products and services, and better understanding how
Zenoss' visitors use the Zenoss website and Zenoss products and
services. To that end, Zenoss may share information, including
personally-identifying information, with its employees, contractors and
affiliated organizations that need to know that information in order to
process it on Zenoss' behalf and that have agreed not to disclose it to
others (for example, if Zenoss were to use a third party to deliver
email newsletters and other email messages). Some of those employees,
contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your
home country; by using the Zenoss website or any Zenoss product or
service, you consent to the transfer of your information to them.
Zenoss does not rent or sell such information to anyone. Zenoss may
also release non-personally-identifying information about visitors and
customers, such as by publishing a report on website usage trends to
our partners and advertisers.</p>
  <p> We will also divulge personal
information to law enforcement agencies or other governmental agencies
when required to do so, when we in good faith believe it is necessary
in order to comply with legal obligations, or when Zenoss believes in
good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
property or rights of Zenoss, members of the Zenoss community, or the
public at large. We may also monitor communications, like email
correspondence and telephone calls, to track reported problems and to
ensure quality assurance.</p>
  <p> If you use a forum, email list or
chat room on the Zenoss website, you should be aware that any
personally identifying information you submit there can be read,
collected or used by other users of those services, and could be used
to send you unsolicited messages. Zenoss is not responsible for
personally identifying information which visitors may choose to submit
in those cases.</p>
  <p> In the event that Zenoss goes through a
business transition, such as a reorganization, merger, acquisition, or
sale of all or a portion of its assets, user information, including
personally identifying information, may be one of the transferred
assets. We are the sole owner of any and all information which we may
collect, including through the Zenoss website and interactive software
features. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How can you access or correct your  personally-identifying information?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> You may view, correct or update the
personally-identifying information we have about you by sending a
request to privacy@zenoss.com. In addition, if you no longer wish to
receive our electronic communications, you may opt-out of receiving
those communications by following the instructions included in each
email or communication you receive. If we use any of your personal
information in a manner that you believe is inconsistent with this
privacy statement, please notify us immediately by sending an email to
privacy@zenoss.com. Your only remedy in any such case is to ask us to
correct such inconsistency.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What are the privacy policies of linked sites and other third parties?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> This privacy policy only addresses the use and
disclosure of information we collect from you. Although you may link to
other sites or third parties via the Zenoss website, we are not
responsible for the privacy practices of third parties or the content
of linked sites.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What security measures does the Zenoss website employ?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> Zenoss has put security measures in place that are
intended to secure and protect against the loss of personally
identifying information collected through the website. However, you
should keep in mind that the website is run on software, hardware and
networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require
maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> From time to time, we may make changes to our
information practices and/or this policy. In such a case, we will
update this policy accordingly, so please review this page periodically
for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What is the effective date of this version of the privacy policy?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p> This version of the privacy policy is effective as of November 8, 2006.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How can you contact us?</h3>
