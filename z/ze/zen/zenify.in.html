This policy applies to your use of Zenify's Website (the "Website"). By using the Website, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information in the manner provided in this policy. This policy does not apply to any other sites.

						<p></p>

						<h4>Information we collect</h4>
						<p>
							We have an option on our Website where you can submit information to us, and we also have features that automatically collect information from the users of our Website.
						</p>


						<h4>Information Collected Automatically and How We Use It</h4>

						<p>We do collect non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII") to identify computers that we have interacted with before. For instance, by using Non-PII, we may be able to identify a computer that has previously visited our Website to see the available properties. In the context of Non-PII, whenever we refer to 'you' or 'yours', please remember that we may be referring to a computer and not an identifiable person since we generally do not know who is using a computer at any particular time.</p>
						<p>Through the collection and use of Non-PII, we provide you with the best possible experience and to tailor our services to your interests and needs. Our purpose is to improve the overall quality of our Website and the services we provide and to help us to provide you faster navigation and access to the various sections of the Website. We may disclose this information to other persons for these purposes or for related purposes, including to information technology companies who assist us in constructing, designing and maintaining the website.</p>
						<p>Non-PII may include information such as the type of Internet browser used by an online user, the type of computer operating system used, the computer's Internet protocol ("IP") address, the date and time of your visit to the Website, whether you have visited the Website previously, what pages of the Website you accessed and what you downloaded, your usage pattern and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of various areas of the site.</p>

						<h4>Information You Provide To Us</h4>

						<p>
							We do not collect personally identifiable information ("PII") from users online unless users affirmatively and deliberately choose to release that information by submitting it by way of registering on our Website. Our registration process request for certain personal information such as name, phone number, e-mail address as well as certain property information in order to assist you in effectively transmitting your expression of interest in our service. By providing us with voluntary PII, you consent to our using the data subject to applicable law. We may use the PII provided by you, to meet your needs and fulfill the request for information you submit, for follow up communications and to send you information services or updates and other information we think may be of interest to you. If you tell us (by accessing opt-out procedure described below) that you do not want us to use the PII information as a basis for any further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.
						</p>

						<h4>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h4>
						<p>
							We may disclose a user's Non-PII and PII when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we reasonably believe that disclosing your PII and Non PII is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or to protect and defend Zenify's rights, interests or property. In addition and if permitted by applicable law we may also disclose and provide access to a user's PII and Non-PII to our vendors and contractors who are performing the services on our behalf. However, such vendors and contractors are not permitted to use such user information for any purpose other than providing services to us. In the above case Zenify shall not be held responsible or liable for any eventuality, loss or damage to the user that may arise out of such action on its part.
