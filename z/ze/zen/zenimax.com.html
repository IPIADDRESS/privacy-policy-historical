<p><strong><a name="7"></a>How is Non-Personal Information Collected?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies</li>
</ul>
<p>ZeniMax and its third party service providers may use cookies, beacons, scripts, e-tags, and other technologies to improve the use of our websites, products and services. A "cookie" is a small file or record-keeping device that websites often store on a user's computer, mobile device or other device.&nbsp; Storage of cookies provides an easy and convenient method for a personalized experience. For example, cookies allow you to log in, allow us to remember your screen name, tell us that you have visited our website before, and may contain information that will make your next visit to our website more enjoyable.&nbsp; You can disable or delete cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our website.&nbsp; A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate information about user's activities in our games and on our websites.&nbsp; For information about how to control cookies, consult the "Help" portion of your internet browser or visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Log Files</li>
</ul>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather information automatically, which is stored in the form of log files.&nbsp; This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, and operating system, website activity, and includes how many "hits" a particular webpage is getting (a.k.a., "click-through data"). We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.&nbsp; This information helps us to understand trends, view and analyze overall website activity, and evaluate and improve the website, including troubleshooting technical issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</li>
</ul>
<p>We also work with third party advertising partners that employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our websites, products, and services by informing us what content is effective.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on webpages and are about the size of a period at the end of this sentence.&nbsp; They cannot be disabled through your browser's hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.&nbsp; This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.&nbsp; You may opt-out of future communications by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the promotional email.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flash LSOs</li>
</ul>
<p>We use local shared objects (LSOs), also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control or high game score, and to display content based upon what you view on our website to personalize your visit.&nbsp; Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your website browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.&nbsp; Our Privacy Notice does not apply to their collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data, and how that data is stored.&nbsp; Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.&nbsp; To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML5</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographic Evaluation (Analytics)</li>
</ul>
<p>In some of our products and websites, ZeniMax may generate aggregate statistics about our user community through the use of Google Analytics, a web analytics service offered by Google Inc. ("Google") and Adobe Omniture (including Adobe Social), a web analytics service offered by Adobe Systems Inc. (“Adobe”), including their respective affiliates, which collect information when you use some of our online products and services and/or play our games on your PC.&nbsp; In addition, we may collect information on your interaction with us on social media sites.&nbsp; We may also use these services to collect and analyze publicly available information that users post about us on various social media sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These analytics providers help ZeniMax evaluate whether a user’s experiences are consistent across the company’s websites and marketing campaigns, as well as within social networks. These tools and technologies use server log files, local stored objects (LSOs), web beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and analyze certain types of information including: IP addresses (including for the purpose of determining your approximate geographic location); browser type and language; referring and exiting pages and URLs; platform type; click information; information about your media; landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, as well as the date and amount of time spent on pages within the websites; game state and the date and time of activity on our websites or games; and information about how you use our games, including game metrics and statistics, feature usage, and similar information.</p>
<p>We may also use certain mobile analytics tools to evaluate, monitor and improve the operation of our mobile applications and related services. These tools may record information such as device information, how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, usage data, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We may link the information we store within the analytics software to other information we collect about you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third party analytics companies who collect information on our websites and mobile apps, and in the context of our online products and/or services may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services.&nbsp; Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies and should you require further information, please consult these policies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>In an effort to provide a safe and fair gaming environment to players of its games, ZeniMax employs “anti-cheating” and fraud prevention software or applications during the use of certain online products and services to prevent fraudulent activities and behavior that may negatively affect the experiences of a player. In some of our products and websites, ZeniMax may generate aggregate statistics about our user community, including their respective affiliates, which collects information when you use some of our online products and services and/or play our games on your PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZeniMax, on its own and through third parties, may collect certain "device-identifying data" about your personal computer or mobile device, such as system information, IP address, screen resolution, device type, (e.g. PC, MAC), operating system (e.g. Windows, OS X, Linux), device time zone, MAC address, general geolocation information, and other system or network information to create a digital identifier of your device.&nbsp; This information may be combined with similar information from our vendor(s) who assist us in conducting these activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These third parties may maintain the information collected about your computer or mobile device as part of their services for other customers and we encourage you to review their privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Push Notifications</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In some mobile products, ZeniMax may send push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about the game, events, or promotions that we may be running.&nbsp; If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.</strong></p>
