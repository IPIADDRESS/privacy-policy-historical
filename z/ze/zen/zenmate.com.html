with general legal provisions on data protection, ZenGuard GmbH has
established this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all
offered and operated services and benefits, particularly with regard to
our website www.zenmate.com and the web browser plugin "ZenMate" offered
by us as well as corresponding offers on mobile devices, other technical
platforms and on social networks (hereinafter collectively referred to
as "ZenMate").</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-data-controller">1. Data Controller</h2>
<p>The data controller responsible for any collection, processing and use
of personal data in each of the ZenMate services is</p>
<pre><code>ZenGuard GmbH
Ritterstr. 12-14
10969 Berlin, Germany
</code></pre><ul>
<li>("we" or "us").</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-personal-data">2. Personal Data</h2>
<p>Our objective is that no personal data is collected, processed or
permanently stored. Personal data is defined as any information
concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or
identifiable individual. Your personal data will be collected or
utilized only to the extent necessary to perform our services or if you
have given us your consent beforehand. This applies, for instance, in
the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you select a certain server to use ZenMate (see below point 2)</li>
<li>When you contact our customer support (regarding product-related
  questions or information material etc.)</li>
<li>Your subscription to newsletters and sending of newsletters and
  mailings</li>
<li>Providing further information upon your request</li>
<li>Your postings in forums, communities and through comment functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Your personal data is collected, stored and used for the respective
purpose only.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-registration-and-use-of-zenmate">3. Registration and Use of ZenMate</h2>
<p>If you choose ZenMate and install the Plugin "ZenMate" made available by
us, we kindly ask you to provide us with a valid e-mail address. We will
generate a password for you which will be sent to you via e-mail.
Additional personal data is not needed. In order to prevent attacks
against ZenMate your IP address will be saved temporarily on the server
without being stored permanently or used for any other purposes.</p>
<p>When using ZenMate, you will have the possibility to select the access
point or the server location you want to use in order to send an
encrypted request to a website. By default, we display the server
closest to you first. As a general rule, this is the fastest connection.
However, if wished, you can choose another server. The decision is all
yours.</p>
<p>When choosing an access point please note that only this server will
process your IP address and request for the webpage you would like to
access (the "Targeted Website"). All servers displayed, are located in
another country, partly outside the European Union, with the consequence
that different data protection laws apply to the respective server and
the processed data. Therefore, you may consider which server to choose
to use ZenMate and to which country therewith you want your IP address
and site request to be transmitted and possibly used and saved
temporarily in order to establish a connection.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding your decision: on the server you selected, your site
request and your IP address are received via an encrypted connection.
Your site request is then forwarded to the Targeted Website without your
IP address, therefore, the website operator does not receive any
information on who wants to gain access to the site. The content of the
Targeted Website is then received by the server you selected and
returned via encrypted connection. Thus, you always send and receive
websites and its content via an encrypted connection using your selected
ZenMate server without any direct contact to the website operator of the
Targeted Website.</p>
<p>Which server you are currently using, can be found out easily any time
by clicking on the ZenMate Plugin. In addition to that you can change
the selected server location any time and therefore, modify your consent
regarding the location where your IP address shall be encrypted.</p>
<p>If your account's data volume is limited we will measure the data you
transfer and receive. However, we will not collect or store the content
of the data. We will only record the mere volume of the data.</p>
<p>If your account's data volume is unlimited we will not even record the
volume of the transmitted data.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-recording-and-revocation-of-the-consent">4. Recording and Revocation of the consent</h2>
<p>We do not store information regarding the location you selected for the
encryption of your IP address when you chose the server location for the
use of ZenMate, because data minimization is the intent and purpose of
ZenMate. Therefore, your IP address is processed only temporarily and
only for transmission to the Targeted Website without being stored
permanently in the logfiles of the server selected by you.</p>
<p>In case you explicitly consent to the processing of personal data (e.g.
for a newsletter), we are obligated to record the given (electronic)
consent according to the German Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz - TMG).
If you wish, you can access the content of the (electronic) consent as
well as revoke the consent with effect for the future at any time. In
such case, we kindly ask you to contact us under our postal address or
e-mail address provided in the imprint.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-e-mail-marketing-according-to-7-abs-3-uwg">5. E-Mail Marketing according to Â§ 7 Abs. 3 UWG</h2>
<p>In accordance with section 7 para. 3 of the German Act Against Unfair
Competition (Gesetz gegen unlauteren Wettbewerb - UWG) we are entitled
to use the e-mail address provided by you for direct marketing for its
own similar products.</p>
<p>In case you wish not to receive any such marketing e-mails any more, you
can object to the respective use of your e-mail address any time by
written notice to ZenGuard GmbH, Ritterstr. 12-14, 10969 Berlin or by
e-mail to support@zenmate.com with the subject "objection to e-mail
marketing" without costs other than the submission costs based on the
basic tariffs. When contacting us via e-mail in this matter please
ensure that you use the e-mail address which you provided to us or name
the e-mail address in question.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-zenmate-app">6. ZenMate App</h2>
<p>We also provide a ZenMate App which enables you to use ZenMate's
services and benefits on a mobile device. This privacy policy also
applies to the ZenMate App. I.e. even if you use the ZenMate App we do
not collect or utilize your data in any other way than described in this
privacy policy.</p>
<p>The ZenMate App compresses the data you send, e.g. uploads and requests
to websites. The compression changes the data in a mere technical way.
The content of the data, for example the content of a document, will not
be affected.</p>
<p>You can activate a filter in the app which blocks malware and ads if you
wish. In this case the data transmitted to you will be screened for
malware and ads and they will be blocked if detected.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-transfer-of-data">7. Transfer of Data</h2>
<p>We shall not transfer any personal data which we collected and stored
based on your consent or on a statutory permission to a third party. In
accordance with the law, however, we are obligated to provide
information on inventory data (Bestandsdaten) as defined in section 14
TMG in some cases. This also applies to data on usage (Nutzungsdaten) as
well as invoicing data (Abrechnungsdaten) as defined in section 15 TMG
respectively.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="8-google-analytics">8. Google Analytics</h2>
<p>We analyse the behaviour of the users in order to further optimize our
services. These evaluations are carried out pseudonymized as defined in
section 15 para. 3 TMG, i.e. the name and other identification features
will be substituted by an identifier with the purpose to prevent the
identification of a specific individual or to render such identification
substantially difficult.</p>
<p>For statistical analysis we use Google Analytics uses a web analytics
service provided by the Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
View, CA 94043, USA; "Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called
"Cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and permit an
analysis of your use of our website and online services.</p>
<p>The information about your use of our websites and online services
generated by the Cookie is transmitted to a server controlled by Google
in the USA and stored there. ZenGuard GmbH uses Google Analytics with
the extension "anonymizeIp()", sending the IP addresses which are to
be transmitted to Google to a server located in Europe first, where they
are shortened and processed with the purpose to prevent individuals
being identified. Google uses this information to analyze your use of
ZenMate or the visit of our website, to create activity reports and to
provide further services related to website or internet use. Google may
also transfer this information to third parties if required by law, or
so far as third parties process this information on Google's behalf.
Under no circumstances Google will relate your IP address to other data
of Google. If desired, you may refuse the installation of the Google
Analytics Cookie by changing your browser settings; please note that in
this case you may not be able to make full use of all functions provided
by us. You may <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">object</a>
to the collection and storage of data on behalf of Google Analytics at
any time with effect for the future by using a Google Browser-Plugin.</p>
<p>Please also take note of Google's privacy policy which is independent
from ours. We assume no responsibility or liability for these guidelines
and proceedings or data collected and processed under Google's
responsibility. Therefore, please obtain further information on
<a href="http://www.google.de/intl/de/privacy.html">Google's privacy policy</a> as
well.</p>
<hr>

<p>You can also follow us in social networks, such as Facebook or on
Twitter. In case you want to provide us information or connect with us
or send a friend request on those networks, depending on your privacy
settings we may be able to access your profile information. Information
on the handling of your personal data by the operator of the respective
network as well as on rights and possible settings of your account can
be found in the privacy policy of the respective social network.</p>
<p>If you activate one of the Facebook, Twitter and/or Google+ "like
