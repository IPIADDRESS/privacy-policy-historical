				<p class="u-marginBottom-10">The categories of information we collect can include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Information you provide to us directly.</strong> We may collect personal information such as a username and password, first and last name, phone number, e-mail address, home address, and employer when you register for an Zenefits account, use our Service, or if you correspond with us. We may also collect additional information you provide to us about your company or employer, your family, and your benefits, which we will consider to be personal information if it is linked to your identifying information. We may combine this information with data we collect from you through other methods, such as telephone conversations or electronic document exchange services, including your social security number, bank account number and other financial information.
					</li>
					<li>

						<br>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="2" class="u-marginTop-30">2. HOW WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGY TO COLLECT INFORMATION</h2>
				<p>We and our third party partners may automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our Service. For instance, when you visit our websites, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us to track your usage of the Service over time. We may collect log file information about your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. Log file information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“<strong>IP</strong>”) address, browser type, information about your mobile device, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit, your use of third party applications, and other information that assists us in analyzing and improving the Service. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our Users, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time, as we believe that there is no consistent industry standard for how to respond to Do Not Track browser settings.</p>

				<p> We may use the data collected through cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including advertising; (c) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website and our Service; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (f) otherwise to plan for and enhance our service.</p>
				<p><strong>Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising</strong> We may permit third party ad networks, social media companies, and other third party services to collect information about browsing behavior from visitors to our Service through cookies, social plug-ins, or other tracking technology. We may permit third party online advertising networks to collect information about your use of our websites over time so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our Service as well as on other websites or services. Typically, the information is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies. The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please refer to your browser’s or mobile device’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. (To learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and related technologies and how you may opt-out of some of this tracking, you may wish to visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and/or the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at	<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>).

			<h3>So how do we keep the lights on?</h3>
			<p>We get paid by benefits providers—for example, your health insurance carrier—if you choose to manage your benefits through Zenefits. Managing your benefits through Zenefits is free (though you still have to pay the providers for your underlying benefits).</p>
			<p>Because we can operate profitably on the revenue paid to us by the benefits providers on our system, we can offer you our service for free—a service PEOs, HR Outsourcers, and other HR software providers typically charge for.</p>
			<p>No hidden fees, contracts, or surprises.</p>
			<p>Even if you choose not to add your benefits, <a href="/core-platform/" target="_blank">Zenefits' Core HR platform</a> is free, though we do offer a few—completely optional—paid products, such as Time &amp; Attendance, and there may be an implementation fee in certain cases.</p>
