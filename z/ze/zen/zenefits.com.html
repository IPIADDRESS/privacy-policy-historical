			We may collect personal information such as a username and password, first and last name, phone number, e-mail address, home address, and employer when you
			register for an Zenefits account, use our Service, or if you correspond with us. We may also collect additional information you provide to us about your
			company or employer, your family, and your benefits, which we will consider to be personal information if it is linked to your identifying information. We

			including your social security number, bank account number and other financial information.

	<p>
		We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features of the Service. We may use this information to communicate with you, such as
		to send you email messages, and to follow up with you to offer information about our Service and your account. We may also send you Service-related emails
		or messages (e.g., account verification, transactional communications, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). For
		more information about your communication preferences, see “Your Choices Regarding Your Information” below.
	</p>
	<h4 id="2">2. HOW WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGY TO COLLECT INFORMATION</h4>
	<p>
		We and our third party partners may automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our Service. For instance,
		when you visit our websites, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that
		uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to
		us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, and other actions you take on the
		Service), and allow us to track your usage of the Service over time. We may collect log file information about your browser or mobile device each time you
		access the Service. Log file information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“<strong>IP</strong>”) address,
		browser type, information about your mobile device, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service,
		domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously
		track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are
		opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. We may also collect
		analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by
		your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit, your use of third party applications, and other information that assists us in analyzing and
		improving the Service. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our Users, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your
		browser at this time, as we believe that there is no consistent industry standard for how to respond to Do Not Track browser settings.

		or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (“<strong>IDFA</strong>”), Google Ad ID, or Windows Advertising ID),

		settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your
		mobile device.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may use the data collected through cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that
		you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including
		advertising; (c) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and
		demographic patterns on our website and our Service; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (f) otherwise to plan for and enhance our service.

		websites or services. Typically, the information is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies. The only way to completely “opt out” of the
		collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please
		refer to your browser’s or mobile device’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools.
