	<h1>Privacy Terms</h1>
	<h4>Information Collection and Use </h4>
	<p>
		Zenefits is the sole owner of the information collected on this
		site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in
		ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Zenefits
		collects information from our users at several different points on our
		website.
	</p>
	<h4>Registration</h4>
	<p>
		In order to use this website, a user must first complete the
		registration/employee profile form. During registration, employers are
		required to grant Zenefits access to their payroll system, from which
		Zenefits imports information such as name, email address, date of
		birth, home address, and social security number for the company's
		employees. This information is used to quote prices for insurance
		products and other benefits. It is also used to enroll the company and
		employees in those products if they choose to enroll, and, if the
		employer chooses to enroll in a benefit program, to contact employees
		about enrollment and if they have problems. Zenefits cannot process a
		user's order without the registration information or allow access to
		the secure portion of the website, as we need this information to quote
		rates.
	</p>
	<h4>Product Orders/Benefit Elections</h4>
	<p>
		We request information from the user on order forms. To make an
		order or benefit election, the user must have logon access to our site,
		and must have provided contact information (like name and shipping
		address) and possibly financial information (like checking account
		numbers). In some cases, we may import this information automatically
		from the payroll system. This information is used to fill customer's
		orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact
		information is used to get in touch with the user.
	</p>
	<h4>Cookies</h4>
	<p>
		A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing
		information about the user. After you enter your username and password
		and click the <strong>Log On</strong> button, we will use a session ID
		cookie to indicate the beginning of your employee session with Zenefits
		and make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie
		expires when you close your browser. If you reject cookies, you will
		not be able to log on to our site.
	</p>
	<h4>Log Files</h4>
	<p>
		We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track
		user's movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate
		use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable
		information.
	</p>
	<h4>Sharing</h4>
	<p>
		We will share aggregated information with our partners such as
		purchase trends and demographic data. This is not linked to any
		personal information that can identify any individual person.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the exception stated in the next paragraph, we use outside
		companies to ship products to a user's home or office. These companies
		do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information
		for any secondary purposes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some providers require us to provide certain personal
		information, such as your name and address and other application
		information, in order for us to enroll you in benefits. YOU SHOULD NOT
		EXPECT ANY MORE PRIVACY OR SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MERELY
		BECAUSE IT WAS PASSED TO THOSE ENTITIES THROUGH Zenefits. Zenefits
		MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ABOUT THESE ENTITIES AND HOW THEY
		WILL TREAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. IF YOU CANNOT ACCEPT THIS RISK,
		YOU SHOULD NOT USE OUR SERVICES.
	</p>
	<h4>Links</h4>
	<p>
		This website contains links to other sites. Please be advised
		that Zenefits is not responsible for the privacy practices of such
		other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our
		site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that
		collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement
		applies solely to information collected by this website.
	</p>
	<h4>Surveys</h4>
	<p>
		From time to time our site requests information from users via
		surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the
		user also has a choice to fill out the survey anonymously. Information
		requested may concern Zenefits processes, website usage, planned
		purchases and requested features. Contact information will be used to
		verify the validity of the input. Survey information will be used for
		the purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of
		this Zenefits website or for future product development.</p>
	<h4>Security</h4>
	<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users'
		information. When users submit sensitive information via the website,
		your information is protected both online and offline.</p>
	<p>When our registration imports sensitive information such as date
		of birth, home address and social security number, that information is
		encrypted using SSL. During this process, the user creates a username
		and password that establishes their account. Once the account is
		established, users must log on to update their profile, place orders or
		review account status - all of which are done on secure pages. While on
		a secure page, such as the registration or 'My Account' page, the icon
		on the bottom of Web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft
		Internet Explorer will show a 'locked' status.
	</p>
	<p>
		While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information
		online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information
		offline. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive
		information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only
		employees who need the information to perform a specific function -
		such as customer support - are granted access to personally
		identifiable information.
	</p>
	<p>
		All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy
		practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added,
		our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we
		place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers'
		information is protected. Finally, the servers that we use to store
		personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure
		environment, behind a locked cage.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have any questions about the security of our website, you can
		send an email to <a href="mailto:support@Zenefits.com">support@Zenefits.com</a>.
	</p>
	<h4>Confirmation Email and Selected Correspondence</h4>
	<p>
		We send all new members a confirming email to verify user
		information and purchases. Established members may periodically receive
		information on products and service enhancements or survey requests
		regarding the use of our site. Out of respect for the privacy of our
		users, we present the option of not receiving these types of
		communications. Please see our opt-out statement below.
	</p>
	<h4>Updating Personal Information</h4>
	<p>
		If a user's personally identifiable information changes such as the
		delivery address, we provide a way to correct, update or remove
		personal data that is provided to us. This can be done at the Employee
		Profile section of the website or via email to 
		<a href="mailto:support@Zenefits.com">support@Zenefits.com</a>.
		User's personal information can also be updated based upon data
		provided to Zenefits from their employer, and via syncs with their
		employer's payroll system.
	</p>
	<h4>Opt-in/Opt-out Choices</h4>
	<p>Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
		communications not directly related to our site. For example, we may
		survey our users for information about their use of our site and
		services or about their interest in possible new products and service
		enhancements. Information on how to opt-out is included in our user
		agreement and can be made by contacting our customer service center.</p>
	<p>
		Users who no longer wish to receive our correspondence or promotional
		materials from us or any partner acting on our behalf may opt-out of
		receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the
		subject line of the email or by emailing us at 
		<a href="mailto:support@Zenefits.com">support@Zenefits.com</a>.
	</p>
	<h4>Legal Disclaimer</h4>
	<p>
		Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy we may need
		to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a
		good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a
		current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on
		our website.
	</p>
	<h4>Contact Information</h4>

		policy, please contact us at:
