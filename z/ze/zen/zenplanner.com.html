		<h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>
		<h2>We value your trust above all things. It's our most basic belief about business.</h2>
	</div>

	<div id="content">

		<div class="highlightBox">
			<b>Our core philosophy</b><br>
			The purpose of our business is to benefit the world by enabling schools that enlighten, and that requires that we build a strong, trusting relationship with each of our customers.  Every action that we take is guided by our effort to earn and maintain your trust.  In all things, we treat you as we would treat ourselves and our family: with courtesy, honesty, and respect.  <br>
		</div>

		<b>Are you watching me online?</b><br>
		No.  Our entire team is expressly forbidden from accessing your private information without your consent.  This means that we may log in to your account in order to provide you with technical assistance, but we do not monitor the private information that you store on Zen Planner.<br>
		<br>
		Our support team does monitor and create aggregate reports regarding general system usage – such as your ability to log in to the website, server response times, and pages visited – in order to provide the best possible service for you.  If you request it, we may also check in with you from time to time to see how we can better serve you.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Will you sell my information once I join? Am I going to get more spam email?</b><br>
		Absolutely not. We will only send you email messages that are necessary to keep you informed about the status of your account, or to provide you with customer service that you’ve requested. <span class="highlight">We will never give, sell, or lease information from your account to a third party for marketing of any kind.</span><br>
		<br>
		We will only allow your private information to be seen by another person in order to comply with a warrant or subpoena from the appropriate authorities in a legal investigation. We do not give out your private data to other private companies or government entities under any other circumstances. We will never ask you to share information about your students with our “marketing partners” or provide them with other “valuable offers.”<br>
		<br>
		<b>Who owns my data?</b><br>
		You do.  All of the information that you store on Zen Planner – student records, schedule, attendance, billing, and payment information – belongs to you. <span class="highlight">We will make it as easy as possible for you to put information in and out of our software.</span> <br>
		<br>
		<b>About Cookies</b><br>
		All modern web browsers support cookies, which are small, temporary pieces of information that are saved on your computer by your browser. Some are concerned about the potential for sneaky companies to abuse cookies, to save sensitive data on their computer that they do not know, or to monitor their online behavior. Please know that our use of cookies is governed by our customer service philosophy, and that they are never used in a misleading, or intrusive way.<br>
		<br>
		Like most secure web applications, we use cookies to allow you to “log in” to our site because they are the most secure way of ensuring that your private data stays private. <span class="highlight">We will never store any personally identifiable information in cookies;</span> they are only random numbers letters that our servers use to keep track of which information you can access. We also use cookies to identify the computers that connect to this website. This is done to provide better customer service and to prevent fraud.  For example, if a suspicious user attempts to log in to your account from an unknown computer in a distant country, we may block that computer from doing so.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Changes to this Policy</b><br>
		In all things, we constantly aim to do the right thing, and to do better than the past.  If we need to update this policy, we will do so to be more clear, open, and honest with you. If so, we will notify you about significant changes via email, or by posting a notice on the website.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Questions?</b><br>
		
		If you have questions about our Privacy Policy, please <a href="/zenplanner/www/support.cfm">contact us</a> or call us toll free at 1-866-541-3570.
