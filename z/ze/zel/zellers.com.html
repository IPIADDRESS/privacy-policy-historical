<h3>Hbc is protecting your privacy</h3>





<p>For over 335 years, Hudson's Bay Company (Hbc) has been a name that means trust in this country. We value you as our
customer, and want to assure you that our 70,000 associates are committed to upholding the trust you've placed in us as
Canada's oldest corporation and largest department store retailer.</p>
<p>Hbc's Principles for the Protection of Personal Information were created to ensure we preserve the confidentiality,
accuracy and security of your personal information. These principles guide us in the collection, use, retention and
disclosure of your personal information in all of our Hbc family of stores and services: the Bay, Zellers, Home
Outfitters, Fields, Hbc Credit, Hbc Rewards and Hbc Insurance.</p>
<h4>The information that we collect</h4>




<br>
<p>Personal information means any information about an identifiable individual. This includes information such as your
name, address, telephone number, birth date, purchase information or e-mail address. As a customer, you provide Hbc
with this information in a variety of ways, such as when making a purchase, applying for an Hbc Credit Card, enrolling
in our Hbc Rewards program, entering in-store contests or signing up for our Gift Registry program. In every case, Hbc
adheres to strict guidelines when dealing with your personal information.</p>
<h4>Collecting your personal information</h4>
<br>
<p>Hbc collects and uses personal information in connection with providing you with goods and services.</p>

<p>When you provide Hbc with personal information, we will inform you as to why we are collecting it.</p>

<p>Hbc obtains your consent for the collection of your personal information. In some instances, where the purpose for




collection is obvious, your consent is implied.</p>
<p>Hbc will ask for your permission to collect additional information that may be useful in serving you in the
future.</p>
<h4>Using and disclosing your personal information</h4>















<br>

<p>Hbc only uses and discloses your personal information for the marketing purposes identified to you when your consent
to the collection of your personal information was obtained.</p>
<p>Hbc does not provide your personal information for marketing purposes of other organizations without your
consent.</p>
<p>You can withdraw, at any time, your consent for the use of your personal information that is not required for a
transaction subject to legal restrictions and upon reasonable notice to Hbc. Your information may be retained by Hbc
for audit or archival purposes.</p>
<h4>Maintaining and safeguarding your personal information</h4>
<br>
<p>Hbc strives to ensure that our security measures protect against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use,
disclosure or modification of your personal information.</p>
<p>Hbc limits access to your personal information to those Hbc associates who may need it for use in accordance with
Hbc's established privacy principles.</p>
<p>Hbc associates sign an annual Code of Conduct, which requires them to keep your personal information confidential
and comply with our security standards.</p>
<p>Hbc keeps your information for as long as necessary to accomplish the identified purpose and in order to serve you
better. Your information is then destroyed according to legislative requirements.</p>

<h4>You are entitled to access your personal information</h4>
<br>
<p>If you request access to your personal information, Hbc will respond to your request within 30 days.</p>





<p>There is no cost for reasonable requests unless you require copies of records. Hbc will advise you of the cost, if
any, prior to copying those records.</p>
<p>Hbc may not be able to provide you with access to your personal information where the information cannot be
separated from the records of others, cannot be disclosed for reasons of security or commercial confidentiality, or is
protected by legal privilege.</p>
<h4>Hbc provides you with the answers</h4>





<br>
<p>Hbc has established a Privacy Office and has appointed a senior executive as its Privacy Officer to ensure that
everyone at Hbc complies with our Principles for the Protection of Personal Information. Hbc will investigate and
respond to any questions, complaints or requests for information you may have.</p>

</tr>
<tr>

<td></td>
<td valign="top"><strong>A:</strong></td>

<td>There are several instances where you are required to give us your personal information for operational and/or
administrative purposes. For example, we require your personal information in order to manage your Hbc Rewards account,
deliver an item to you that you may have purchased, or maintain your gift registry. Giving us your personal information
for these kinds of <i>primary</i> operational purposes is necessary to obtain certain products and services from
Hbc.<br>


<br>
However, agreeing to the use of your personal information for additional secondary marketing purposes is entirely up to
you. You may contact our Privacy Office at any time to request that we not use your personal information for marketing
purposes.</td>

collection?</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td></td>
<td valign="top"><strong>A:</strong></td>




<td><i>Primary</i> purposes are those purposes that are operational and are absolutely necessary for Hbc to be able to
provide the products and/or services that you request from us. For example, a primary purpose for our collecting your
address may be to ensure we can successfully deliver to your home an item you may have purchased.<br>

<p>The information provided by you in order to make a purchase on a Hbc E-store is collected to process your online
transaction, ship your item(s), administer our post-purchase survey and maintain the accuracy of your information. In
order to protect you and Hbc from fraudulent transactions, Hbc may provide your transaction-related information to a
reputable third party organization to perform an address verification. This address verification is intended to ensure
that the "bill to" address that you provide matches your credit card address.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>


<p>This website strives to protect your personal information. For security of transactions, we use the Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts any information you send to us electronically. The encryption process protects
your information, such as your credit card number, billing and shipping information by scrambling it before it is sent
to us from your computer. Once the website receives your transmission, we make commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure its security on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
secure. As a result, while this website strives to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of
any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<h4>Unlawful Activities</h4>


<p>This website reserves the right to co-operate with local, provincial, national and international authorities in
investigations of improper or unlawful activities and this may require the disclosure of personal information. We may
also report to other organizations about improper or unlawful user activities on this website and this reporting may
include disclosure of personal information relating to those individuals conducting such improper or unlawful
activities.</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>



<p>Your web browser places cookie files on your computer's hard drive. This website uses cookies to remember
information you gave us so that you don't have to re-enter the information each time you visit this website. Cookies
also help us understand which areas of our site are popular by showing us how you and others use our site. For more
information about cookies and why they are used, please refer to our cookies page.</p>
<h4>Web Beacons</h4>


<p>This website uses electronic images called Web beacons, which are single-pixel (1 x1) or clear GIF images placed in
the web page code. Web beacons are used for many of the same purposes as cookies, allowing us to understand the
effectiveness of our marketing efforts and our site usability. Web beacons collect non-personally identifiable
information on user traffic patterns, which we then analyze to improve the overall user experience on our website.</p>
<h4>About Any Other Information you send to this website</h4>



<p>Apart from information relating to shopping orders, Shop.Hbc.com Membership or eNewsletters, we do not collect or
wish to receive any information or other materials from you through this website that may be considered personal,
confidential or proprietary. All information and materials received (other than information concerning shopping orders,
