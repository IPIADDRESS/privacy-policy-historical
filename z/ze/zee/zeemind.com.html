<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Zeemind collects
<em>non-personally-identifying</em> information of the sort that web browsers and
servers typically make available, such as the browser type, your language
preference, the referring site, the date and time of each request, and any
Javascript errors that occur during your visit. Zeemind’s
purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
understand how Zeemind’s visitors use its website so we
can make improvements and fix bugs. From time to time, Zeemind
may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>


<p>
Zeemind avoids collecting potentially personally-identifying
information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses except to the extent
necessary to provide certain services.


</p>






<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Zeemind may collect statistics
about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance,
Zeemind may monitor the most popular pages on
zeemind.com sites. Zeemind may display this
information publicly or provide it to others. However, Zeemind
does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
below.</p>

<h3>Google App Engine</h3>
<p>Some of Zeemind's services may be provided by Google App
Engine, a service operated by Google (a third party service provider). As such,
you should assume that any information you provide to Zeemind
may be available to Zeemind and to Google. For details about the
specific privacy guarantees made by Google in its capacity as a service
provider, please refer to <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html">code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html</a>.</p>

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Zeemind discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors
and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
process it on Zeemind’s behalf or to provide services available
at Zeemind’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose
it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations
may be located outside of your home country; by using Zeemind’s
websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
Zeemind will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above,
Zeemind discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order
or other governmental request, or when Zeemind believes in good
faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
of Zeemind, third parties or the public at large. If you are a
registered user of a Zeemind website and have supplied your
email address, Zeemind may occasionally send you an email to
tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date
with what’s going on with Zeemind and our products. We primarily
use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we
expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for
example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve
the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
or to help us support other users. Zeemind takes all measures
reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the
visitor returns. Zeemind uses cookies to help
Zeemind identify and track visitors, their usage of
Zeemind website, and their website access preferences.
Zeemind visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
Zeemind’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of
Zeemind’s websites may not function properly without the aid of
cookies.</p>

<h3>Javascript Errors</h3>
<p>Zeemind’s software products are complex. Occasionally, error
conditions which we did not anticipate may occur. If such an error condition
occurs on your computer, we may log a small amount of
non-personally-identifying information about the error in order to help our
engineers prevent it from occurring again.</p>

<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If Zeemind, or substantially all of its assets were acquired,
or in the unlikely event that Zeemind goes out of business or
enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers
may occur, and that any acquiror of Zeemind may continue to use
your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by
advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information
allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that
they believe will be of most interest to you. Except in the section "Advertiser
Cookies" immediately below, this Privacy Policy discusses the use of cookies by
Zeemind and does not cover the use of cookies by any
advertisers. For more information about advertiser cookies you should consult
the privacy policies of the specific advertising networks you wish to learn
more about.</p>

<h3>Advertiser Cookies</h3>
<p>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on
your prior visits to the Zeemind website. Google's use of the
DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to the
Zeemind site and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out
of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">advertising opt-out page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Zeemind may
change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Zeemind’s
sole discretion. Zeemind encourages visitors to frequently check
this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this
site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of
