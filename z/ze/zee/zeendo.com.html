    We provide this Privacy Policy, part of our general Terms of Service, to inform you of our policies and
    procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of the personal information we receive when you
    visit www.zeendo.com, and when you use any part of our Service available through the Site or other related
    websites, toolbars, widgets, applications or distribution channels we may operate from our "Service".
    <br><br>

    your behalf as part of the Service. This Policy may be amended or updated from time to time. You are advised
    to consult this Policy regularly for any changes.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>1. Information Collection &amp; Use</strong></h3>

    If you choose to use ZEENDO's service in the form of a paid account, ZEENDO will collect personally
    identifiable information (credit card number, billing address, phone number) and store this information in
    our secure server in order to process your invoices. This information will only be used to verify credit
    card authenticity and to issue invoices, as stated in your service agreement.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3>1.3 Third Party Websites</h3>
    This policy applies to the Service only. We do not have control over third parties websites that provide
    information, or over banners, adverts or links placed in the Site or the Service. Those other sites may
    introduce their own cookies or other files in your computer, collect data or ask for your personal
    information.
    <br><br>
    The collection and use of such information and access to third party websites are subject to such third
    party's privacy policy. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and other terms of such third parties'
    websites before using their services.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>2. How We Use Personal Information:</strong></h3>
    Information collected from our service logs is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and to
    establish statistical information about website traffic. This statistical information is not added in such a
    way that any given user of the system may identify it. ZEENDO is the sole owner of the information collected
    at www.zeendo.com. Your information will never be shared, leased or given to any third parties in ways other
    than those stated in this Privacy Policy.
    <br><br>
    Personal Information is used for the following purposes: (i) to provide the Service, (ii) to manage your use
    of the Service and any accounts you may have with us, (iii) to personalize your experience, (iv) to provide
    to you service announcements, (v) to provide you with further information and offers from us or from third
    parties that we believe you may find useful or interesting, such as newsletters or marketing or promotional
    materials, on behalf of, and according to, instructions from a third party, like our advertising partners,
    (vi) to enforce our Terms of Service, (vii) to resolve any disputes between users of the Site or between
    such users and ourselves, and (viii) to contact you to obtain feedback from you regarding the Site and the
    Service. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such announcements, information or
    offers, please follow the instructions to unsubscribe provided in the communication.
    <br><br>
    We use the information that is not Personal Information for the above purposes and also in order to (i)
    monitor and analyze the use of the Service and the technical management of the Site, (ii) improve the Site
    and the Service, (iii) generate and obtain useful data and information concerning the interests,
    characteristics and website use behaviour of our users, and (iv) verify that users of the Service meet the
    criteria required to process their requests.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>3. Information Security:</strong></h3>
    We store all user information in secure databases protected by means of a variety of industry-standard
    access controls. Secure passwords, SSL encryption, disk-based encryption, firewalls, and other measures are
    in place to help us to protect your data. This data is accessed only for the purposes specified in this
    privacy statement.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions about security on our website, you can send us a support request using our support
    system or an email to
    <a href="mailto:help@zeendo.com">help@zeendo.com</a>.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>4. Access to Personally Identifiable Information:</strong></h3>

    <h3>4.1 Changing Information</h3>
    All information stored at ZEENDO related to your account, including any subscription billing information, is
    accessible through your website's Admin Panel. You may use this panel to modify your information at any
    time, and we encourage you to keep this information up to date so that your customer service requests and
    billing processes operate efficiently.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3>4.2 Removing Information</h3>
    Our users can review, update, amend or delete their personal information, provided that it is not mandatory
    otherwise by law or due to legitimate business purposes. You can remove your personal information from our
    system submit an email with your account data to
    <a href="mailto:help@zeendo.com">help@zeendo.com</a>. Please note that if you completely delete all such
    information, your account may be deactivated.
    <br><br>
    In addition, we may delete any information provided by you or related to you, pursuant to our policies valid
    at the time or the current applicable law.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>5. Communications from ZEENDO</strong></h3>

    <h3>5.1 Service-related Announcements</h3>
    We may send you service-related announcements by email, for instance, if our service is temporarily
    suspended for maintenance. Although these are not commercial communications, if you do not wish to receive
    them, you can deactivate your account.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3>5.2 Other Messages and Customer Service</h3>
    Occasionally, we may also send you messages about new features or services that we offer to our users. You
    may unsubscribe from these communications at any time by clicking on the link at the bottom of our
    communications to you, or by changing the preferences in your profile.
    <br><br>
    When you issue a customer support request to ZEENDO, we may use your information and email address to
    contact you regarding your inquiry.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>6. Information Sharing and Disclosure:</strong></h3>

    <h3>6.1 Non Personal Aggregate Information</h3>
    We may share aggregate information with third parties, including reports generated as a result of your use
    of the Service, including non-identifiable information and login data, for industry analysis, demographic
    profiling, and other commercial purposes, like offering targeted advertising about other products and
    services. Any aggregated information shared in these instances will not contain your Personal Information.
    We do not aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3>6.2 Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
    ZEENDO employs third-party service providers to perform functions on our behalf. These services include
    credit card processing, email service providers, data analysis, and customer services. These service
    providers will have access to the personal information needed to perform their functions, but will not use
    it for any other purposes, and are obliged to comply with this Policy.
    <br><br>
    We may release account and other personal information when we believe it necessary to comply with the law,
    enforce or apply our Terms of Service, or protect the rights, property or safety of ZEENDO, our users or
    others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and
    credit risk reduction.
    <br><br>
    In the event of a business transfer or sale of ZEENDO, client information will generally be one of the
    transferred business assets, but remains subject to the conditions of any pre-existing Privacy Policy
    (unless, of course, you consent for its use otherwise).
    <br><br>
    Aside from what is set out above, you will be notified when information about you may be derived to third
    parties, and you will be able to choose not to share the information.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3>6.3 Combined Information</h3>
    We may combine certain Personal Information with non-personal Information in order to create information and
    services packages that better suit your interests and preferences. Among other things, linking that
    information will allow us to improve and personalize the Site and the Service. If we combine or link any
    information with your Personal Information, the resulting combination will be treated as Personal
    Information and this Policy will apply.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3>6.4 Disclosure of you of information to other users</h3>
    It is not permitted to collect personal information from other users through the Service, the Site, or in
    any other way that may be connected to the use of the Service or the Site. Any information that you may
    choose to share in a comment or submission to the Site or the Service will be publicly available and may
    allow for other users to know about you. We recommend that you preserve your privacy and sensitive
    information, and encourage you to carefully consider what kind of information about yourself you want to
    disclose in your comments and observations.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3>6.5 Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h3>
    We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with
    the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private
    parties as ourselves, at our discretion, that we believe necessary or appropriate to comply with the
    applicable legislation (including, but not limited to, court summons), in order to protect our property or a
    third party's property, and the rights thereof, or to prevent or stop any activity that is or has the risk
    to be illegal, immoral, inappropriate or punishable by law.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>7. Log Files:</strong></h3>
    As it happens with most websites, we collect certain information automatically and store it in log files.
    This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
    referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
    <br><br>
    We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, administer the site,
    track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
    <br><br>
    This information may also be used to identify users who are using the service for spam or other activity
    that may conflict with our Terms of Service. This information will be used as a whole, and never linked back
    to any personal identification information.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>8. Cookies:</strong></h3>
    Like most websites, we use small bits of data called cookies, stored on users' computers to simulate a
    continuous connection. Cookies let us 'remember' information about your preferences and passwords and allow
    you to move within our Service without reintroducing yourself. Users who disable cookies will not be able to
    use the Service, as they are required to maintain their login information to our service during a browser
    session.
    <br><br>
    Disabling cookies does not prevent you from accessing websites published under our system, although some
    features of those sites may be degraded.
    <br><br>
    These cookies can be tied back to personally identifiable information only in the event that you are logged
    into our Service. If you are logged in to our Service, the cookies on your computer will only identify your
    account within our system.
    <br><br>
    This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ZEENDO only and does not cover the use of cookies by any
    advertisers. See the 'Third Party Advertisers' section for more details.
    <br><br>
    Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to, or control
    over, these cookies. See Third Party Advertisers.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>9. Links to Other Sites:</strong></h3>
    This website contains links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been
    followed.
    <br><br>
    These are links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by ZEENDO. Please note that we, ZEENDO, are
    not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
    <br><br>
    We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every
    website that collects personally identifiable information.
    <br><br>
    This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by this Website.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>10. Third Party Companies, Business Transitions, and Information Processing:</strong></h3>
    We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Service, to provide the Service on our
    behalf or to perform services related to the management of the Service or the Site (including, but not
    limited to, maintenance, payments, hosting and database management services, web analytics and
    administration). These third parties will only have access to your Personal Information in order to perform
    these tasks on our behalf. However, these parties may be subject to their own privacy policies, so you are
    advised to consult them regularly.
    <br><br>
    In the event that ZEENDO went through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another
    company, or sale of all or part of its assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, your personally identifiable
    information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change
    in ownership or control of your personal information.
    <br><br>
    Please note that your information may be processed, stored or transferred outside of your state, where the
    privacy laws may not be as protective as those within your area.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>11. Legal Disclaimer:</strong></h3>
    ZEENDO reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when
    we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding,
    court order, or legal process served on our Website.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>12. Changes in this Privacy Policy:</strong></h3>
    We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. We will not
    materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected
    in the past without the consent of affected customers.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3><strong>13. Security</strong></h3>
    We are concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ a variety of measures designed to protect
    your information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, we do not promise that your Personal
    Information or private communications will be protected from unauthorized disclosure or use. PLEASE DO NOT
    PROVIDE ANY PRIVILEGED INFORMATION ON THE SITE OR WHEN USING THE SERVICE.
