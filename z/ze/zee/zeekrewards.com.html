services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following
circumstances: </font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">&nbsp; - we provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of

take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our
privacy policy. We sometimes release beta versions of our products, which are
further refined before the release of the final version. Because these products
are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue,
despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome user feedback on any privacy
concerns you may have. In light of the above and because of the complex and
constantly changing nature of our technology and business, ZeekRewards does not
guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. ZeekRewards shall not be
liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this
privacy policy. </font>
