After a transaction, your private Information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Additional Safeguards. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your Information. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of your identity before we disclose Personal Information to you;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Trusted vendors. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We rely only on vendors who ensure an appropriate level of security of your Data.

Amazon Web Services is our processor. AWS Amazon cloud platform uses various security technologies and procedures to protect personal data and is compliant with third-party assurance frameworks such as ISO 27017 for cloud security, ISO 27018 for cloud privacy, PCI DSS Level 1, and SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3.&nbsp;For more details please see AWS Amazon security and privacy policy at www.aws.amazon.com.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want you to feel confident using our Site to conduct business.
