</p>
<p>
We use this information to understand how people are interacting with our website in order to improve our products and services. Web server log information is retained for six months. Website usage data shared with our data processors will be retained for the period necessary to fulfill processing purposes as described <a href="#info-duration">below</a>.

This may include your first name, last name, email address, (mobile) phone number, street, city, state, country, postal code, product interest, questions and whether or not you want to subscribe to our newsletter. The Zero Motorcycles Dealer Application form also includes details about your business, such as your company name, DBA information, fax number, offered motorcycle brands, financial information, facility information, and other data.
</p>
<p>
When you submit a form, we record how you got to our site (e.g. email link, search terms, ad campaign, referral site, etc.).

<h3 class="f5-alt tracked-none alternateGothic ttu lh-title mb2 mt4">Employment Applications</h3>

</p>
<h3 class="f5-alt tracked-none alternateGothic ttu lh-title mb2 mt4">Motorcycle Ownership Information</h3>
<p class="first">
When you purchase a new Zero Motorcycles motorcycle from a dealer or a distributor, we require them to submit your contact information so we can confirm the start of the warranty period and so that we can send you pertinent service updates should the need arise. In addition, as Zero Motorcycles announces new accessories or other products that might be used with your motorcycle, we will use this information to keep you updated. This information is stored at our data processor Salesforce.
</p>
<p>
Ownership history of our motorcycles is kept for the period necessary to fulfill processing purposes as described <a href="#info-duration">below</a>. We may contact prior owners should the need arise. For example, while the current owner is supposed to contact us to transfer ownership via our website, we regularly are contacted by the new owner. Should we discover a motorcycle was stolen, we have the ability to contact the previously registered owner. Processing this information is necessary for the performance of our (service) contract, compliance with legal obligation (i.e. to warrant driving safety) and for our legitimate interest to provide our services to you, and to continuously improve our products.
</p>
<h3 class="f5-alt tracked-none alternateGothic ttu lh-title mb2 mt4">Service Request Information</h3>

Notes from the phone conversations, the text of the emails and any attachments provided are saved with this case. We retain this information through data processor Salesforce for the period necessary to fulfill processing purposes as described <a href="#info-duration">below</a>. Processing this information is necessary for the performance of our (service) contract, compliance with legal obligations (i.e. to warrant driving safety) and for our legitimate interest to provide our services to you, and to continuously improve our products.
</p>
<h3 class="f5-alt tracked-none alternateGothic ttu lh-title mb2 mt4">Zero Motorcycles App Data</h3>

The Zero Motorcycles App gives you the ability to email diagnostic information to the Zero Motorcycles Customer Service Team. This will include information identifying the motorcycle such as VIN, the motorcycle’s settings (such as model, sprocket sizes) and information from your motorcycle’s event and error logs, which includes times and dates of rides along with the motorcycle performance data during these rides: speeds, temperatures and charging events. Statistical data about your ride and usage of the app, including but not limited to distance travelled, average speed and energy consumption may also be submitted. If you choose to email the bike log information to Zero Motorcycles, it will be associated with your motorcycle and its ownership information. This information is immediately shared with the dealer that originally sold the motorcycle and Zero Motorcycles personnel.
</p>
<p>
We use this information to resolve issues with your motorcycle and to improve product quality. We retain this information through data processor Salesforce for the period necessary to fulfill processing purposes as described <a href="#info-duration">below</a>. Processing this information is necessary for the performance of our (service) contract, compliance with legal obligations (i.e. to warrant driving safety) and for our legitimate interest to provide our services to you, and to continuously improve our products.
</p>
<p>

Flurry also records the types of devices and operating systems used, general geographic information, as well as events that occur within the Zero App, such as how often it is used and other anonymous data.
</p>
<p>
We use this data to determine which mobile devices and languages we should support. <a target="_blank" href="https://policies.oath.com/us/en/oath/privacy/index.html">Flurry Analytics</a> data will be retained for the period necessary to fulfill processing purposes as described <a href="#info-duration">below</a>.

<p class="first">
If you fail to provide certain information when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have entered into with you, or we may be prevented from complying with our legal obligations.

We take reasonable organizational and technical measures to help secure your personal data, ensure availability and to help prevent unauthorized access, illegal processing or distribution, as well as accidental loss, modification or destruction. Your personal information is not stored on our public web server. In a very few cases an error log entry may be made when your personal information is submitted.

<h2 class="f3 mb3 mt4">Transferring information outside of the EU</h2>
<p class="first">
Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have operations. Zero Motorcycles is based outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) in the USA and your personal data will be transferred to and processed in the USA. The USA is not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data. However, your personal data will be processed in compliance with EU data protection legislation under specific contracts approved by the European Commission which ensures the same level of protection of your personal data it has in the EEA.
</p>
<p>
Many of our data processors are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
</p>
<p>
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
</p>
<ul class="unorderedList">
<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en">European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries</a>.</li>
<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en">European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</a>.</li>
<li>Where we use providers based in the USA, we may either use the above contracts approved by the European Commission or we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU–U.S. Privacy Shield which, as outlined above, requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the USA. For further details, see <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en">European Commission: EU-U.S. Privacy Shield</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
