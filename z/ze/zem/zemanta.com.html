<div id="content-wrap">
<div id="privacy">
<h3>At Zemanta ltd. we are taking the privacy of our users very seriously and we would like to clearly state our privacy policy.</h3>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>

<p>Like most website operators, Zemanta ltd. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Zemanta ltd.'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use Zemanta.com website.</p>

<p>Zemanta ltd. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Zemanta ltd. does not use such information to identify visitors of Zemanta.com, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>Certain visitors of Zemanta.com website choose to interact with Zemanta.com in ways that require Zemanta ltd. to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Zemanta ltd. gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address. In each case, Zemanta ltd. collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Zemanta.com. Zemanta ltd. does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

<p>Zemanta ltd. may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Zemanta ltd. may reveal how many downloads Zemanta extension got, or say how many blogs or blog posts used Zemanta web service to enhance their content based on requsts to api.zemanta.com. However, Zemanta ltd. does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>Zemanta ltd. discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Zemanta ltd.'s behalf or to provide services available at Zemanta ltd.'s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Zemanta ltd.'s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Zemanta ltd. will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Zemanta ltd. discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Zemanta ltd. believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Zemanta ltd., third parties, or the public at large. If you have signed up for Zemanta Newsletter by providing email address, Zemanta ltd. will occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Zemanta ltd. and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Zemamta ltd. takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Zemanta ltd. uses cookies to help Zemanta ltd. identify and track visitors, their usage of Zemanta ltd. website, and their website access preferences. Zemanta ltd. visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Zemanta ltd.'s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Zemanta ltd.'s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2>Zemanta service (Extension and API)</h2>

<p>When you submit your content to Zemanta service for processing we retain the copy of the submitted content as well as metadata (tags) and content enhancements (links to different kinds of web content) regarding that content. Transaction logs of this process contain information such as date and time of the request and response, your Zemanta-assigned license key, information about the servers which processed your request and IP address of the request.</p>

<p>No web or API user is able to access the submitted content unless they provide both Request ID (RID) and API key that is connected to that RID. Both API key and RID are randomly generated and the likelihood of guessing them is extremely small - however not impossible. Trying to reach the content with submission of random RID is prohibited by Zemanta Terms of Service. Content retained by Zemanta will be used for purposes of improving the service, debugging and collecting statistics on service usage.</p>

<p>Zemanta ltd. retains the right to provide generated metadata and content enhancements to third parties if they provide correct RID. Zemanta ltd. also retains the right to publish aggregated statistics on both the submitted content and generated metadata and content enhancements. </p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Zemanta ltd. may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Zemanta ltd.'s sole discretion. If we will do so, we will use reasonable efforts to inform all Zemanta users of any change to the privacy policy in advance. Zemanta ltd. encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
