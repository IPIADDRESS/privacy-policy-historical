					<a id="general-information"></a>
					<h3>
					General Information
					</h3>
					<p>
					Zevera collects four types of information:
					</p>
					<h4>
					(i) Information related to your account ("personal information")
					</h4>
					<p>
					This information is collected for the purpose of administering your Zevera subscription, and includes your email and payment information, which you submit on our order page when you purchase a membership.
					</p>
					<h4>
					(ii) Aggregate connection summary statistics
					</h4>
					<p>
					Zevera collects minimal information about usage. These statistics never include anything about what the user did with the site: no data about the contents or destinations of traffic and no IP addresses are stored permanently.
					</p>
					<h4>
					(iii) Anonymous connection diagnostics
					</h4>
					<p>
					Connection diagnostics are anonymized and cannot be tied back to individual users. This is needed for billing and to check usage on our services.
					</p>
					<!-- /Personal Information -->
					<a id="personal-information"></a>
					<h3>
					Personal Information
					</h3>
					<p>
					We require you provide personal information, such as an email address and payment information, so that we can email you, process payments and respond to support queries. Important: The specific information collected varies depending on the payment method you choose. To minimize the amount of information, we encourage that you use bitcoin.
					</p>
					<p>
					With some forms of payment we use a third-party payment processor to complete the transaction. To understand what personal information these processors collect and store, please refer to the respective processor's terms and privacy policy.
					</p>
					<p>
					Zevera uses your email address for the following reasons:
					</p>
					<ul>
					<li>To send emails related to payment transactions;</li>
					<li>To provide links to our Site, including password reset emails;</li>
					<li>To send you updates and announcements;</li>
					<li>
					To send marketing information, such as Zevera offers, surveys, invitations, and content about other matters in connection with Zevera
					(“<strong>Marketing emails</strong>”).
					You may choose to not receive Marketing emails by following the opt-out procedure described in these emails.					</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					Zevera uses your personal information only for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
					</p>
					<!-- / Aggregate Connection Summary Statistics -->
					<a id="aggregate-statistics"></a>
					<h3>
					Aggregate Connection Summary Statistics
					</h3>
					<p>
					We ensure that we never log traffic destination, data content, IP addresses. Therefore:
					</p>
					<ul>
					<li>We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service.</li>
					<li>We do not know which user was connected at a specific time or which IP addresses they used.</li>
					<li>We do not know the set of original IP addresses of a user’s computer.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					We cannot supply this information because the data don’t exist.
					</p>
					<p>
					In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service, Zevera collects the following information related to your usage:
					</p>
					<h4>
					Aggregate sum of data transferred
					</h4>
					<p>
					We collect information regarding the total sum of data transfer so we know which services are popular and need more ressources.
					</p>
					<h4>
					Summary
					</h4>
					<p>
					We collect minimal usage statistics to maintain our quality of service.
					</p>
					<p>
					We’ve engineered our systems to categorically eliminate storage of sensitive data.
					<strong>We may know THAT a customer has used Zevera, but we never know HOW they have utilized our service.</strong>
					</p>
					<!-- / Anonymous Connection Diagnostics and Crash Reports (Can be turned off by the user) -->
					<a id="anonymous-diagnostics"></a>
					<h3>
					Anonymous Connection Diagnostics
					</h3>
					<p>
					We collect anonymized data used for network diagnostics. We use these data in our network tools to help optimize network speeds and to let us identify problems related servers, or ISPs.
					</p>
					<!-- / Jurisdiction and Applicable Law -->
					<a id="jurisdiction"></a>
					<h3>
					Jurisdiction and Applicable Law
					</h3>
					<p>
					Zevera wants to keep your information private. Zevera’s registered place of business is in Malaysia, which has stricter laws concerning information disclosure than most countries.
					</p>
					<p>
					In Malaysia are no data retention laws, and any legal order must come from court. Information requests from foreign courts are not respected. Should we receive a valid legal order from the Malaysian Court, it is important to note that
					<strong>Zevera does not keep worthy logs of any IP addresses or traffic data.</strong>
					</p>
					<!-- / Storing of Information Related to Email, Live Chat, and Feedback Forms -->
					<a id="storing-information"></a>
					<h3>
					Storing of Information Related to Support Tickets
					</h3>
					<p>
					Zevera uses a helpdesk system which keeps the conversation you submit to us along with our response. The helpdesk collects your email address and any additional information you provide to us. These records are deleted manually but regularly.
					</p>
					<!-- / Security Measures to Protect Your Information -->
					<a id="information-security"></a>
					<h3>
					Security Measures to Protect Your Information
					</h3>
					<p>
					Zevera uses best practice technical security at our servers so to prevent misuse and unauthorized access. Access to user information is restricted to only the admins on need to know basis to perform their job functions.
					</p>
					<p>
					We believe these systems are robust, but no data security measures in the world can offer 100% protection.
					</p>
					<p>
					Servers are housed in data centers with strong security practices.
