      <br>

If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the information you provide is being transmitted to us in the United States, and will be subject to this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, which may not be as protective as the laws in your country. By using Zearn, you agree to this.</p>
      <p>By registering students for Zearn or providing us with any student information, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to provide such information and to allow the information collection and use for your students.</p>

      <br>

      <h2>1.	Information Collected by Zearn</h2>
      <p><u>Information You Provide:</u><br>
      When educators register for Zearn, we ask you to provide certain personal information, such as your first and last name, your role, the name of your school, district, city, state, email address, and a password. Teachers are also asked to provide their grade level.  </p>
      <p>In the alternative, you may register for Zearn by using a pre-existing Google account. Please be aware that Google has its own privacy policy, and we encourage you to read it. By registering with Zearn through your Google account, you agree to our collection and use of any personal information or other data we may receive from them in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. </p>
      <p>To sign up your students for Zearn, we may ask you to provide each student’s first and last name, and unique student identifier, as well as log-in information including username and password and non-personal information such as current grade level. Zearn only collects information about students when it is provided by a school representative legally authorized to share the student’s information. Students under 13 may not register on their own.</p>
      <p>You may also choose to register your students on Zearn using a school authorized Google email account. By doing so, you confirm that you have obtained any necessary permissions from your school, district, and parents.</p>

      </p>
      <p><u>Site Usage Information:</u><br>
      When using Zearn, our servers automatically collect certain site usage information associated with your computer.

It may also include information such as the date and time you accessed Zearn, how much time you spent on Zearn, the pages you visit, and other “click-stream” data.  </p>
      <p>We use cookies to collect the Program and Site Usage information described above. A cookie is a small data file that may be sent by a website or application and stored on the hard drive of your computer. A cookie stores information about your browser that allows us to recognize your browser when you return and to remember your preferences. You may reject cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use Zearn.

      <p>When users provide feedback or report a concern, we use their information to respond to their request or fix the issue. We do not email students directly at any time; any concerns reported by a student will be resolved through the adult who created the student’s account.</p>
      <p>You remain in control of the personal information you provide to us about yourself and your students. This means that you can review, revise, or delete your personal information or that of your students as described below.</p>

      <p><u>Program Information:</u><br>
      We use Program Use Information to (1) provide you with information regarding your students’ usage and performance on Zearn and  (2) to serve sequential and progressive lessons to your students.  </p>

      <p><u>Site Usage Information:</u><br>
      We use Site Usage Information to administer the site and program, monitor and diagnose problems with it, remember you when you return so that you don’t have to resubmit your information and so that we can maintain your progress, and to improve our program.</p>

      <br>

      <h2>3.	How We May Share Your Information:</h2>
      <p>We do not ever sell or rent your information.</p>
      <p>We will only share your information or that of your students in the following circumstances:
        </p><ul>
          <li>When we believe in good faith that disclosure of your information is necessary to protect our rights and those of others, to protect your safety or the safety of others, to investigate fraud or to respond to a government, judicial or other legal request or to comply with the law.</li>
          <li>In connection with an organizational change, such as a dissolution, provided that your information and that of your students will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</li>
          <li>We sometimes hire third parties to perform certain business-related functions for us. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, hosting services, and processing payments. When we employ another company to provide services to support Zearn, we provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. Our third parties are legally obligated to keep your personal information confidential and use it only for our specific purpose.  </li>
        </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>We may also share certain aggregated, de-identified information with third party providers to help us analyze the information.  Our third party providers are prohibited from further sharing or making additional use of the data.</p>

      <br>

      <h2>4.	Your Access and Opt-Out Rights</h2>
      <p>You may review or change the information you have provided about yourself by logging into your account or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@zearn.org">support@zearn.org</a>. If you contact us, we will ask you to verify your identity before we provide you with information or make changes.  </p>
      <p>If you are an educator who has provided us with personal information about your students, you may review or revise that information at any time by logging into your account and accessing your classroom portal.</p>
      <p>You may also choose to opt out of email messages and newsletters from us.  To opt out, simply click on the “unsubscribe” button that appears on emails or contact us at <a href="mailto:support@zearn.org">support@zearn.org</a></p>

      <br>

      <h2>5.	Data Retention:</h2>
      <p>You may deactivate your student(s)’ account at anytime through the product account dashboard. Following deactivation, we will retain deactivated account data for a period of 6 months so that you may easily reactivate your account within that limited period and retain continuity of your classroom progress. However, you may request deletion of your account data earlier by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@zearn.org">support@zearn.org</a>. During the 6 months that your account is inactive, we do not access your account data.</p>
      <p>We do retain aggregated, anonymized information for some of the purposes described above.  </p>

      <br>

      <h2>6.	Security:</h2>
      <p>We maintain reasonable security standards to help safeguard your data. Zearn has multiple security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under our control. These include encryption of data in transit and at rest, use of two-factor authentication to access the system, regular software security updates, and industry best practices for network and physical security.</p>
      <p>However, please be aware that no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit or otherwise provide to us and you do so at your own risk.</p>
      <p>If you create an account, you will be asked to select a password for both yourself and each student to access Zearn, and this password will be used to allow your student to use Zearn. You are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your and your students’ account password(s), and for any activity that occurs under your account credentials, whether or not authorized by you. Please notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any suspected breach of security. </p>

      <br>
