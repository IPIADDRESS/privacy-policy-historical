If you contact Zeal we may keep a record of that correspondence. Zeal also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever Zeal collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. Zeal may at times also collect IP addresses and login records for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.   We may also collect information through the use of "pixel tags" included in email messages we may send to you. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files, not visible to the human eye, that are included in HTML-encoded email messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable email program, the recipient's computer will access our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with the recipient's email address, the date and time the recipient viewed the email message, that the recipient's email program is capable of receiving HTML-encoded email, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may see or read cookies.</td>
