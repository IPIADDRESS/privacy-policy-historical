				<p class="mt5">
					We will not without your express consent provide your personal information to any of the third parties for
				the purpose of direct marketing.
				</p>
				<p class="mt15">
					<b>For advertisement</b> - For the purpose of marketing and promoting our services we gather information of all
					user accounts and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and
					other third parties, while doing so we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used
					to identify you personally, especially your name, email address, password, credit card number, and bank
					account number are never disclosed to third party advertisers.
				</p>
				<p class="mt15">
					<b>Matters relating to our Website</b> - This website does not protect you against the identification information
					which you yourself would have provided by associating your name with your User ID. Although our pages
					with personal information are coded with robot exclusion headers, individuals and corporations may
					illegally attempt to automatically collect your email address from the Site. We would also keep you
					informed of any suspicious activity or policy violations on the Site once they come to our notice.

					<b>External Service Providers</b> - We do not disclose your personal information to external service providers
				unless you provide your explicit consent. To prevent our disclosure of your personally identifiable information
				to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services. Because
				we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before
				deciding to use their services.
				</p>
				<p class="mt15">
					<b>Internal Service Providers (ISP)</b> - Unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to the
					ISP for additional use we may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or
					outsource one or more elements of our services (e.g., search, identity verification, discussion boards and
					surveys) and therefore we may provide some of your personally identifiable information directly to them
					subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit the use of the your
					information we provide them. At instances where we require a survey to be undertaken and have authorized
					an ISP to do the same, you will be notified of the involvement of theISP, and all information disclosures
					you make will be strictly optional. If you provide additional information to an ISP directly, then their use of
					your information is governed by their applicable privacy policy as has been mentioned above earlier.
				</p> 
				<p class="mt15">
					<b>Change in Corporate Entities</b> - You agree that we may share personally identifiable information about you
					with our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries and joint ventures that are committed to serving your online trading
					needs and related services, throughout the world. The privacy practices followed by us are governed by this
					Privacy Policy document and we and our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries and joint ventures use these policies
					to the extent allowed by applicable law. In the event of merger of all the entities with another separate
					entity or in the event of acquisition of this company by another company you should expect and agree that
					Zepo may share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide you the user services. You
					will be served a notice of such event (to the extent it occurs) and we will require that the new combined
					entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
				</p> 
				<p class="mt15">
					<b>Legal Compliance</b> - We shall disclose your information where necessary to cooperate with law enforcement
					inquiries, in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, violations of our terms
					of service as well as to enforce laws and third party rights, such as intellectual property rights and laws
					relating to fraud., or as otherwise required by law or if there is a valid court order in this regard. We will, in
					furtherance of such needs adhere to the requests made, in relation to criminal investigation or alleged
					illegal activity, or other activity that may expose us or you to legal liability, (and you authorise us to)
					disclose personal information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, User ID history,
					about you as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.
				</p> 
				<p class="mt15">

					Agreement when It is understood that You have expressly violated the Terms stipulated under this Agreement
