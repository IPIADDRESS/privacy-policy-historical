<h2>1. WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DOES ZEDGE COLLECT?</h2>

We obtain certain information when you provide it to us: for example, if you setup your account profile, sign in using your Facebook Connect or Google login, or report a problem, you may provide your name, email address, your date of birth, photograph, and a list of interests such as your favorite music and television shows. Some of that information can be used by Zedge to identify or contact you directly and is sometimes referred to as personally identifiable information. When you purchase virtual currency or products through our Services, we use a third-party payment processor that collects your payment information and completes the transaction. We use the personally identifiable information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Services to: deliver the products and services that you have requested, manage your account and provide you with customer support, communicate with you about products or services that may be of interest to you, and to monitor compliance with the rules governing the Services. We don't sell your personally identifiable information to third parties.</p>
