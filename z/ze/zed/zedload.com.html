<br>

The next time you visit that particular site it will not recognise you and will treat you as a completely new visitor as there is nothing in your browser to let the site know that you have visited before.
<br>
<br>
2) Persistent Cookies: These remain on your hard drive until you erase them or they expire. 
How long a cookie remains on your browser depends on how long the visited website has programmed the cookie to last.
