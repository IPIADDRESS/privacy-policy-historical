				<p>&nbsp;</p>

Zuora uses a persistent encrypted cookie, if the client requests, to save and retrieve individual authentication information as well as other per-client device preferences.  When a visitor follows a link to the Zuora Web site from an affiliate or promotion, Zuora stores information about that affiliate or promotion in a session cookie.  Acceptance of these cookies is optional.  Zuora issues a mandatory session cookie to each user of the Services only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session.
