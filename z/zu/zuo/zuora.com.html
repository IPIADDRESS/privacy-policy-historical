						<h3>Collected Information</h3>

						<p>We require people who register to use a Zuora online application (the "Services") to give us contact information. Depending on the Services chosen, we ask for contact and account information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, e-mail address, password, and the number of users in the organization who will be using the Services, in addition to financial and billing information, such as billing name, address and credit card number. When you express interest in additional information, when you register for the Services, or after you become a user, we may ask for additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax number or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees or industry. You can opt out of providing additional information by not entering it when asked. Zuora Services users, while you are logged into your account you will have the ability to provide us with third party personal information, such as name, email address, phone number, street address and password. This information is used to set up accounts of your customers so that you may bill them for the services that you provide them and so that you can keep track of the payments that have been made and/or are past due.</p>
 
						<h3>Communications from the Site</h3>

						<p>Zuora does not distribute or share customer e-mail addresses or any other personal information, except as noted in its <a href="../company/msa.html" title="MASTER SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT">Terms of Service</a>, or as may be required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.</p>

Zuora does not share your business data with Referral Partners.</p>

						<p>Zuora has integration relationships with third-party companies and individuals ("Integration Partners"). These relationships extend the functionality of the Services and the Integration Partner application or service ("Integrated Service") by allowing the Services and the Integrated Service to exchange customer data and to establish linked business processes between the two. Customers who pay Zuora for use of the Services and use this Integrated Service are considered customers of both Zuora and the Integration Partner. Zuora and an Integration Partner may share customer contact, account, financial and billing information, and business data with respect to their integrated business relationship with the customer.

This sharing also allows the Integration Partner to provide consolidated billing services to the shared customer and allows for the enhanced functionality of the integrated service. Shared contact, account, financial and billing information, and business data is governed by the Zuora <a href="../company/msa.html" title="MASTER SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
