<h5>1. Introduction</h5>

<p>This privacy policy is designed to inform users of the Zumper, Inc. website and any related smartphone or mobile application, including Zumper Pro (collectively, the "Website"), about how Zumper, Inc. ("Zumper", "we" or "us") gathers and uses personal information submitted to Zumper through the Website. Zumper will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and with applicable U.S. laws. In this policy, "user" or "you" means any person viewing the Website or submitting any personal information to Zumper in connection with using the Website. By using the Website, you are indicating your consent to this Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE WEBSITE.</p>

<h5>2. What Information Do We Collect?</h5>

<p>Personal Information:</p>

<p><i>Renters</i>: If you sign up to use services offered through the Website, Zumper may collect certain personal information, including your name, email address, home address, employment information, phone number, educational background, credit score, financial information and income and tenancy history (collectively, the "Personal Information"). The collection of such Personal Information is consistent with our provision of services to you, including the facilitation of preliminary determinations by landlords, landlord representatives, brokers, property managers and sub-lessors of your suitability as a potential tenant. In addition, if you contact Zumper and disclose additional personal information, we may store that Personal Information.</p>

<p><i>Landlords and Brokers</i>: When landlords, landlord representatives, brokers, property managers and sub-lessors list properties for rent on the Website, we collect the name, telephone number and email address of a contact person for such landlord, landlord representative, broker property manager or sub-lessor. We also collect bank account information from landlords, landlord representatives, brokers, property managers and sub-lessors so we are able to process payments in connection with the successful rental of listed properties.</p>

<p>Web Tracking Information:</p>

<p>We, and third party service providers that we engage to provide services to us ("Contractors"), may use web tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs in order to operate the Website efficiently and to collect data related to usage of the Website. Such collected data ("Web Tracking Information") may include the address of the websites you visited before and after you visited the Website, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Website you visit and what links you clicked on, and whether you opened email communications we send to you. In order to collect Web Tracking Information and to make your use of the Website more efficient, we may store cookies on your computer. We may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages on the Website or in email communications to collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Website or such email communications, and our Contractors may also do so. We do not correlate Web Tracking Information to individual user Personal Information. Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to you. You may be able to modify your browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted when you use the Website, but this may affect the performance of the Website.</p>

<h5>3. How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</h5>

We may enter Personal Information into our contact management database, and may use such database to send you marketing materials and to contact you regarding your interest in Zumper products and services.</p>

<p><i>Aggregate Information</i>: We will also create statistical, aggregated data relating to our users and the Website for analytical purposes. Aggregated data is derived from Personal Information and Web Tracking Information but in its aggregated form it does not relate to or identify any individual. This data is used to understand our customer base and to develop, improve and market our services.</p>

<p><i>Web Tracking Information</i>: We use Web Tracking Information to administer the Website and to understand how well our Website is working, to store your user preferences, and to develop statistical information on usage of the Website.

<p><i>Legal Exception</i>: Notwithstanding the above, Zumper may use Personal Information to the extent required by law or legal process, or if in Zumper's reasonable discretion use is necessary to investigate fraud or any threat to the safety of any individual, to protect Zumper's legal rights or to protect the rights of third parties.</p>

<h5>4. What Information Do We Disclose to Third Parties?</h5>

<p><i>Zumper's Disclosure of Personal Information</i>: We will use the Personal Information you give us to fulfill the services you request from us. This may include sharing such Personal Information with any of our Contractors, or with any landlord, landlord representative, broker, property manager or sub-lessor who is bound by obligations of confidentiality and with whom you may wish to enter into a rental contract. Except as set forth in the previous sentence, as described under "Permitted Disclosures" below, and as otherwise authorized by you, Zumper will not disclose Personal Information to any third party.

Certain Web Tracking information, such as the popularity ranking of certain pages of the Website, may be published on the Website and so disclosed to all users of the Website.</p>

<p><i>Aggregate Information</i>: We may disclose aggregated data that does not contain Personal Information to any third parties, such as potential customers, business partners, advertisers, and funding sources, in order to describe our business and operations.</p>

<p><i>Permitted Disclosures</i>: Notwithstanding the foregoing, Zumper reserves the right to disclose any information we collect in connection with the Website, without further notice to you to any successor to Zumper's business as a result of any merger, acquisition or similar transaction; and to any law enforcement or regulatory authority to the extent required by law or if, in Zumper's reasonable discretion, disclosure is necessary to investigate fraud or any threat to the safety of any individual, to protect Zumper's legal rights or to protect the rights of third parties.</p>

<h5>5. How Can You Opt Out of Use and Disclosure of Your Information?</h5>

<p>If you would like your Personal Information removed from our mailing list or database, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@zumper.com">hello@zumper.com</a>. In the event of any such removal, Zumper may retain copies of information for its archives.</p>

<p>Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others. However, your name will no longer be associated with that information on the Website. Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested. Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies indefinitely, but will not be available to others.</p>

However, no method of electronic storage or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that security breaches will not occur. Without limitation of the foregoing, we are not responsible for the actions of hackers and other unauthorized third parties that breach our reasonable security procedures.</p>

<h5>8. Links</h5>
