      <div class="mini-headline">Landlords and Brokers:</div>

      <p>When landlords, landlord representatives, brokers, property managers and sub-lessors list properties for rent on the Website, we collect the name, telephone number and email address of a contact person for such landlord, landlord representative, broker property manager or sub-lessor. We also collect bank account information from landlords, landlord representatives, brokers, property managers and sub-lessors so we are able to process payments in connection with the successful rental of listed properties.</p>

      <div class="mini-headline">Legal Exception:</div>

      <p>Notwithstanding the above, Zumper may use Personal Information to the extent required by law or legal process, or if in Zumper's reasonable discretion use is necessary to investigate fraud or any threat to the safety of any individual, to protect Zumper's legal rights or to protect the rights of third parties.</p>

      <h5>4. What Information Do We Disclose to Third Parties?</h5>

      <div class="mini-headline">Zumper's Disclosure of Personal Information:</div>

      <p>We will use the Personal Information you give us to fulfill the services you request from us.

      <div class="mini-headline">Web Tracking Information:</div>

      <p>We may disclose Web Tracking Information to Contractors in order to analyze the performance of the Website and the behavior of users, and to operate and improve the Website. We may also share Web Tracking Information with third parties to enable them to serve you ads for their products and services on other websites. Certain Web Tracking information, such as the popularity ranking of certain pages of the Website, may be published on the Website and so disclosed to all users of the Website.</p>

      <div class="mini-headline">Aggregate Information:</div>

      <p>We may disclose aggregated data that does not contain Personal Information to any third parties, such as potential customers, business partners, advertisers, and funding sources, in order to describe our business and operations.</p>

      <div class="mini-headline">Permitted Disclosures:</div>

      <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Zumper reserves the right to disclose any information we collect in connection with the Website, without further notice to you to any successor to Zumper's business as a result of any merger, acquisition or similar transaction; and to any law enforcement or regulatory authority to the extent required by law or if, in Zumper's reasonable discretion, disclosure is necessary to investigate fraud or any threat to the safety of any individual, to protect Zumper's legal rights or to protect the rights of third parties.</p>

      <div class="mini-headline">Third Party Ad Servers:</div>

      <p>We may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements on the Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Website. They automatically receive your IP Address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content. Further, these advertisers may also serve ads to you on other websites (including ads for our products and services) based on information collected from you while using the services available through the Website. For example, we use Google's "remarketing" service to target Zumper ads to you based on your prior use of the Website when you visit other sites in Google's content network.</p>

      <p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers or other websites.

Please also include your name and all of the email addresses and phone numbers that you have provided to us. If you would like your Personal Information removed from our mailing list or database, please contact us at hello@zumper.com. In the event of any such removal, Zumper may retain copies of information for its archives.</p>

      <p>Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others. However, your name will no longer be associated with that information on the Website. Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested.
