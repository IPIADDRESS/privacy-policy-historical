<p class="level1">8. We are committed to ensuring that your personal information is secure.

If you decide that you do not want ZUJI to use your Personal Information or to share your Personal Information with third parties, you understand and accept that this may in some cases impact on the availability of services and the quality of services that ZUJI may provide to you and may mean that the services provided to you (if possible at all) by ZUJI may not be customised for your use, may be less user-friendly and less efficient.</p>
<p class="level1">2. Accessing your Personal Information and retention of Personal Information</p>
<p class="level2">a. You may at any time access, delete or change your Personal Information or subscribed services. You can easily access your Personal Information if you login as a member to ZUJI or you can follow the links that may be provided within our subscription emails to you to manage your subscription preferences.

<p class="level1">3. Minors</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>As we cannot distinguish the age of persons who access our Websites, a blanket privacy policy is applied. ZUJI does not seek or intend to seek to receive any Personal Information from minors (i.e. persons younger than twenty-one years of age). Should a parent or guardian have reason to believe that a minor has provided ZUJI with Personal Information without their prior consent, please contact us to ensure that the Personal Information is removed and unsubscribe them from any promotional contact opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Websites, we will ask you for your friend's Personal Information including without limitation, name and email address.

ZUJI stores such Personal Information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p class="level1">5. Security</p>

<p class="level3">b. ZUJI will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any Personal Information which we hold about you. Your Personal Information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. Unfortunately, despite the aforementioned technology and security features, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot give an absolute assurance that the Personal Information you provide to us will be secure at all times, and we cannot be responsible for any event arising from unauthorised access to your Personal Information.
