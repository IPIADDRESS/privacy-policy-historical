<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Minors</p>
<ul>
<ul>

</ul>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;5. Security</p>

ZUJI will not be held responsible for events arising from third parties gaining unauthorized access to your Personal Information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">c. Please note also that ZUJI may use overseas facilities to process or back up your Personal Information.

<ul>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;You can play your part in safeguarding your Personal Information by never disclosing your login password or account information to anybody unless such person is duly authorized by you.
