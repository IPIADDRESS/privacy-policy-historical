                    The hypothetical performance results displayed on this website are hypothetical results in that they represent trades made in a demonstration (“demo”) account.  Transaction prices were determined by assuming that buyers received the ask price and sellers the bid price of quotes Zulutrade receives from the Forex broker at which a Signal Provider maintains a demo account.  The hypothetical results do not include any additional mark-ups or commissions which may be charged by a customer’s Forex broker and are based on a one lot trade size.  Trades placed in demo accounts are based on a Signal Provider having access to an unlimited amount of funds.  As a result, demo accounts are not subject to margin calls and have the ability to withstand large, sustained drawdowns which a customer account may not be able to afford.  Trades placed in demo accounts are not subject to price slippage which may occur when a signal is actually traded in a customer account.  The number of pips gained or lost by each Signal Provider may be based on the trading of mini, micro or standard lots.  The performance of customers electing to trade a different lot size from those used by a Signal Provider will therefore vary.  Further, customers may place trades independent of those provided by a Signal Provider or place customized orders to exit positions which differ from those of a Signal Provider.  All performance results presented only include the results of completed trades and do not reflect the profit or loss on open positions.  Due to differences in the bid/ask offered by various counterparties, all trades executed in the account of a Signal Provider may not be executed in a customer account if the bid/ask of the Forex broker at which the customer maintains the customer’s account is different from that of the Signal Provider’s broker or due to volatility in the market.  Customers may elect not to follow all of the trading signals provided by the signal providers or be able trade the recommended number of contracts due to insufficient funds in an account. Therefore, the results portrayed are not indicative of an account which may have traded all a Signal Provider’s signals or contracts.  Further, by electing to follow a number of different Signal Providers at one time, customers may not be able to follow all of the signals generated due to the customer’s account having insufficient funds.  Accordingly, the performance of customer accounts may vary signicantly from the results portrayed on this website.

                <p class="force-ltr nfa-disclaimer">
                    HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.

The trading systems herein described have been developed for sophisticated traders who fully understand the nature and the scope of the risks that are associated with trading. Should you decide to trade any or all of these systems' signals, it is your decision. The performance results displayed on this website are hypothetical in that they represent trades made in a demonstration (“demo”) account.  The trades placed in the demo account take into consideration the spread between the bid and ask prices which would have been paid by a trader if an actual trade was made.  Transaction prices were determined by assuming that buyers received the ask price and sellers the bid price of quotes provided by a large Forex broker.
