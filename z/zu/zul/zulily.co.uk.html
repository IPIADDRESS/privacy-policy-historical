<h1><span>Privacy Policy</span></h1>
<p>zulily UK Ltd. (“zulily”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy
to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from
users of our Website.</p>

<p>
The zulily team members are customers themselves of other Internet sites and fully appreciate
and respect the importance of privacy on the Internet. We will not disclose information about our
customers to third parties except where it is part of providing a service to you - e.g. arranging for
a product to be sent to you, carrying out credit and other security checks and for the purposes of
customer research and profiling or where we have your express permission to do so.

</p>




<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;User Consent</h3>
<p>By submitting Personal Data through our Website or related services, you agree to the terms of this
Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance with
this Privacy Policy. We will not sell your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information or
personal information to any third party without your permission.</p>


<h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A Note About Children</h3>
<p>We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13.</p>



<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Types of Data We Collect</h3>
<p>zulily collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our Website and when
you send us information or communications. “Personal Data” means data that allows someone
to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail
address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to
any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to
your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We
collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
</p>


<p><strong>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Personal Data You Provide to Us.</strong> We collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail and mailing addresses, password, and various demographic items such as number of children, ages, gender when you sign up for a zulily Account (as defined in the Terms of Service) and make purchases on the Website. When you order Products (as defined in the Terms of Service) on our Website, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, billing information and shipping information. We also retain information on your behalf, such as your credit card information for future purchases and addresses you add to your address book. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail (e.g., in response to an employment opportunity posted on our Website), we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us (e.g., a resume). When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information. When you post messages on the message boards of our Website, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it. We may also collect Personal Data, such as demographic information or personal preferences, from you via other points in our Website that state that Personal Data is being collected. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Personal Data Collected via Technology.</strong> To make our Website, Products, and related services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect Personal Data from you, including your operating system and version, browser type and version, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit our Website or access your zulily Account on our network. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our Website may not work properly.</p>


<p><strong>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Personal Data That We Collect from You About Others</strong>. If you decide to invite others to the Website or create a zulily Account for a third party to join the Website, we will collect your and the third party’s names, e-mail addresses, and/or phone number in order to send an e-mail or text message and follow up with the third party. You or the third party may contact us at <a href="mailto:service@zulily.co.uk">service@zulily.co.uk</a> to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>


<h3>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use of Your Data</h3>

<p><strong>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;General Use.</strong>In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests
that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. zulily uses your Personal Data in the following
ways: to facilitate the creation of and secure your zulily Account on our network; identify you as a
user in our system; provide improved administration of our Website and Product sales; improve the
quality of experience when you interact with our Website and Products; send you a welcome e-mail
to verify ownership of the e-mail address provided when your zulily Account was created; send you
administrative e-mail notifications, such as security or support and maintenance advisories; respond
to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests; to do demographic analysis
on our membership base; to send promotional communications as described in Section 7.1 below; to

provide you with electronic newsletters; and/or to make telephone calls to you, from time to time,
as a part of secondary fraud protection or to solicit your feedback.</p>
<p><strong>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Creation of Anonymous Data.</strong> We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data
by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you.
We use this Anonymous Data to analyse request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the
content of our Products and services and improve Website navigation. zulily reserves the right to use
and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties at its discretion.</p>


<h3>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
<p><strong>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Affiliates / Acquisitions. </strong>Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries,
joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), we may in the
future. We may share some or all of your Personal Data with these Affiliates, in which case we will
require our Affiliates to honour this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires zulily or our assets,
that company will possess the Personal Data collected by it and us and will assume the rights and
obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Other Disclosures.</strong> Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as
described below), zulily may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is
necessary to (a) investigate any violation of the law or this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service; (b)
comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on zulily; or (c) protect or
defend the rights or property or safety of zulily or users of the Products or related services.</p>



<h3>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Third parties</h3>

<p><strong>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Personal and/or Anonymous Data Collected by Third Parties</strong>. Our provision of a link to any
other website or location, such as the websites of our Product suppliers or payment processing
service providers, is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other
website or location or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave our Website and go
to another site. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data
from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside
websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these
outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on links to such outside
websites.</p>



<p><strong>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disclosure to Third Party Service Providers.</strong> Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do
not generally sell, trade, share, or rent the Personal Data collected from our services to other
entities. However, we may share your Personal Data with third party service providers to provide

you with the Products and related services that we offer you through our Website; to conduct
quality assurance testing; to provide technical support; or to provide specific services, such as
synchronization of your contacts with other software applications, in accordance with your
instructions. These third party service providers are required not to use your Personal Data other
than to provide the services requested by zulily. You expressly consent to the sharing of your
Personal Data with our contractors and other service providers for the sole purpose of providing
services to you.</p>

Sites, you will be opted back in to our newsletters and promotional communications until you opt
