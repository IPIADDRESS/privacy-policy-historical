</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">At Zuberance, Inc. 
(“Zuberance” or “us” or “we”), we respect the privacy rights 
of our online visitors and recognize the importance of protecting the 
information we collect about you.  Our Privacy Policy is designed 
to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information 
you decide to share.  This Privacy Policy applies to our website 
located at <a href="http://www.Zuberance.com" target="_blank">www.Zuberance.com</a> and its related subdomains (collectively, 
the “Site”) and all products and services we offer on the Site (together 
with the Site, the “Service”).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri"> <br>
By using or accessing the Service, you are accepting the practices described 
in this Privacy Policy.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri"><b>EU Safe Harbor Participation</b></font> <br>

</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Zuberance adheres to 
the “Safe Harbor” framework that was established by the U.S. Department 
of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission to comply with 
the European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection that went into 
effect in October, 1998.  If you have any complaints regarding 
our compliance with the Safe Harbor, you should contact us at [privacy@Zuberance.com].</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Calibri"><b>The Information We Collect and How 
We Use It</b></font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">In general, you can 
use our Service without providing us with any personal information.  
However, there are instances where you must provide us with certain 
personal information in order to receive full access to the Service 
or to assist us in delivering a superior level of customer service.  
In such instances, we may collect the following types of information:</font> <br>
</p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Calibri">Log Information – When 
  you access the Service, our servers automatically record information 
  that your browser sends whenever you visit a website and our analytics 
  platform may capture additional information about use of our Site.  
  This information may include information such as your Internet Protocol 
  address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit 
  pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  
  We may use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Service, 
  to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic 
  information about our user base as a whole.  We do not link this 
  automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Calibri">Cookies – We store certain 
  information from your browser using “cookies”.  A cookie is 
  a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping 
  purposes.  </font></li>

  <li><font size="3" face="Calibri">User Communications – 
  When you send email or other communications to us, such as requests 
  for information about our products, we may retain those communications 
  in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve 
  the Service.</font></li>
</ul>
 <br>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">By using the Service, 
you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed 
in the United States.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri"><b>Children Under Age 
13</b></font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Zuberance does not 
knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under 
the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register.  If 
you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Service 
or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, 
telephone number, or email address.  No one under age 13 may provide 
any personal information to or on the Service.  In the event that 
we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 
age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that 
information as quickly as possible.  If you believe that we might 
have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact 
us at [privacy@Zuberance.com].</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri"><b>Sharing Your Information 
with Third Parties</b></font> <br></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Zuberance does not 
sell, trade or transfer your personal information to third parties except 
in the following limited circumstances:</font> <br></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Calibri">We have your consent.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Calibri">We may share your personal 
  information with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or service partners 
  for the purpose of processing your personal information on our behalf 
  or to assist us with marketing, advertising or product/service offerings 
  and fulfillment of orders.  For example, we provide personal information 
  to our service providers for direct emailing of our newsletters, online 
  surveys or notifications of our product/service offerings.  We 
  require that these parties agree to process such information based on 
  our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any 
  other appropriate confidentiality or security measures.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Calibri">We have a good faith belief 
  that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is 
  reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, 
  legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable 
  Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, 
  (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical 
  issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property 
  or safety of Zuberance, its users or the public as required or permitted 
  by law.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Calibri">We become involved in a 
  merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets.</font></li>
</ul>

 <br>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">We may share with third 
parties aggregate, non-personal information.  Such information 
does not identify you individually.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri"><b>Choice/Opt-out</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">We provide you with 
the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your personally identifiable 
information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.  
For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive 
any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference 
on our Site.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">If you no longer wish 
to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out 
of receiving them by following the instructions included on our Site.</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri"><b>Links</b></font> <br>

</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">This Privacy Policy 
applies solely to information collected by Zuberance.  The Site 
may contain links to other third party websites.  Even if the third 
party is affiliated with Zuberance through a business partnership or 
otherwise, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other 
websites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the 
Site to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects 
personally identifiable information.  </font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri"><b>Accessing and Updating 
Personal Information</b></font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">When you use the Service, 
we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal 
information and either provide you means to correct this data if it 
is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise 
required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.  
We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested 
to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, 
and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive 
or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize 
the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, 
requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which 
access is not otherwise required.  In any case where we provide 
information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, 
except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri"><b>Enforcement</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Zuberance regularly 
reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy.  Please feel free
