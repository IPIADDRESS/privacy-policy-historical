				<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, Effective 07/10/09</p>
				
				<p>At Zuberance, Inc. ("Zuberance" or "us" or "we"), we respect the privacy rights of our online visitors and recognize the importance of protecting the information we collect about you. Our Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide to share. This Privacy Policy applies to our website located at www.Zuberance.com and its related subdomains (collectively, the "Site") and all products and services we offer on the Site (together with the Site, the "Service").</p>
				
				<p>By using or accessing the Service, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
				
				<p><strong>EU Safe Harbor Participation</strong></p>
				
				<p>Zuberance adheres to the "Safe Harbor" framework that was established by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission to comply with the European Commission's Directive on Data Protection that went into effect in October, 1998. If you have any complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor, you should contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@zuberance.com">privacy@zuberance.com</a>.</p>
				
				<p><strong>The Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong></p>
				
				<p>In general, you can use our Service without providing us with any personal information. However, there are instances where you must provide us with certain personal information in order to receive full access to the Service or to assist us in delivering a superior level of customer service. In such instances, we may collect the following types of information:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Log Information</strong> - When you access the Service, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website and our analytics platform may capture additional information about use of our Site. This information may include information such as your Internet Protocol address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We may use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Service, to track users' movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</li>
					<li><strong>Cookies</strong> - We store certain information from your browser using "cookies". A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.</li>
					<li><strong>User Communications</strong> - When you send email or other communications to us, such as requests for information about our products, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve the Service.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>By using the Service, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Children Under Age 13</strong></p>
				
				<p>Zuberance does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Service or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on the Service. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@zuberance.com">privacy@zuberance.com</a>.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</strong></p>
				
				<p>Zuberance does not sell, trade or transfer your personal information to third parties except in the following limited circumstances:
				</p><ul>
					<li>We have your consent.</li>
					<li>We may share your personal information with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or service partners for the purpose of processing your personal information on our behalf or to assist us with marketing, advertising or product/service offerings and fulfillment of orders. For example, we provide personal information to our service providers for direct emailing of our newsletters, online surveys or notifications of our product/service offerings. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality or security measures.</li>
					<li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Zuberance, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
					<li>We become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>We may share with third parties aggregate, non-personal information. Such information does not identify you individually.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p>
				
				<p>We provide you with the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our Site.</p>
				
				<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included on our Site.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
				
				<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Zuberance. The Site may contain links to other third party websites. Even if the third party is affiliated with Zuberance through a business partnership or otherwise, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the Site to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Accessing and Updating Personal Information</strong></p>
				
				<p>When you use the Service, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either provide you means to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>
				
				<p>Zuberance regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Zuberance's treatment of personal information by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@zuberance.com">privacy@zuberance.com</a> or by writing to us at:</p>
