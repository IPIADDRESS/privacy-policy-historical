        <p>zuuzs, LLC (“<em>zuuzs</em>”  or “we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy of its Members (“you” or  “Member”) and has developed this “Privacy Policy” to demonstrate its commitment  to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information we  collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your  choices about such uses and disclosures.&nbsp; We encourage you to read this  Privacy Policy carefully when using zuuzs.com or services or transacting  business with us or our Merchants (as defined in the <a href="http://www.zuuzs.com/about/terms/">Terms of Service</a> via zuuzs.com.

        <br><p>If you have any questions about  our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for  information on how to contact us.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What Data We Collect and Why</h2>
        <p>The information we learn from our  Members helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping and social experience  at zuuzs.com.&nbsp; We may collect Personal  Information that can identify you (“Personal Information”) such as your name  and email address as well as other information that does not identify you (“Anonymous  Information”).&nbsp; When you provide Personal  Information through zuuzs.com, the information may be sent to servers located  across the United States.&nbsp; Below are the  types of information we gather.</p>
        <br>
        <ul style="padding-left:20px;">
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><h3>1. Information You Provide </h3></li>
        <p>We collect and store any Personal  Information you submit to us voluntarily through zuuzs.com or provide to us in  some other manner (<em>e.g.</em>,  creating/editing your Member profile, information entered in reviews, ratings,  postings, comments, and forums). This includes identifying information, such as  your name, address, email address, telephone number, and profile picture, and,  if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment  method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial  information). </p>
        <br><p>We also may request information  about your interests, activities, gender, age, and other demographic  information, which we may share with advertisers on an anonymous basis. &nbsp;If you sign up for surveys or other activities  that we make available to you on zuuzs.com, we will collect the information  designated along with such activity, which may include your contact information  such as your address and phone number.&nbsp;  If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or  services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and  other related information.&nbsp; </p>
        <br>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><h3>2. Information From Other Sources</h3></li>
        <ol style="padding-left:20px;">
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><h4>A. Cookies  and Other Technologies&nbsp; </h4></li>
        <p>We use cookies and other  technologies, such as, web beacons (also known as “clear gifs” and “pixel tags”)  to recognize you, customize your experience, and serve advertisements. &nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies are very small files placed on your  computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to zuuzs.com and  distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors. They also allow us to save Member  preferences and track Member trends. We rely on cookies for the proper  operation of zuuzs.com; therefore if your browser is set to reject all cookies,  the website will not function properly and you may lose functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we require our Members to have  cookies enabled in order to accumulate and receive fundzs (<em>i.e.</em>, cash payments).&nbsp; We do  not link cookies or web beacons to any Personal Information. &nbsp;&nbsp;We may also enable advertisers and ad servers  to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on zuuzs.com.  These advertisers and ad servers may use cookies and/or web beacons to monitor  information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements  will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This  Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad  servers.</p>
        <br>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><h4>B. Information Collected Automatically&nbsp; </h4></li>
        <p>We automatically receive and  collect from your internet use information like your IP address, the URLs of websites  from which you arrive or leave zuuzs.com, your type of browser and language,  access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously  accepted from us, your operating system, your mobile provider, your mobile  device, and your ISP. We may use such information to analyze trends, administer  the website, prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and gather  broad demographic information.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <br>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><h4>C. Website Activity Information </h4></li>
        <p>We keep track of some of the  actions you take on zuuzs.com, such as participating on discussion  boards/forums, providing ratings and reviews, inviting friends or indicating  you “like” a post/product. When you provide information or content to us, such  as, profile pictures, sharing a review or rating, in addition to storing the  actual content you uploaded, we might log the fact that you shared it.&nbsp; Furthermore, any information that is  disclosed on discussion boards/forums become public information and you should  exercise caution when deciding to disclose any Personal Information. </p>
        <br>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><h4>D. Information Collected by Third Parties</h4></li>
        <p>We retain information you provide  in connection with third party services, which includes Merchants, available  through zuuzs.com like surveys and polls or other third party research  undertaken with your consent. We may also collect information about you and  your friends who use zuuzs.com, from any social network you may have connected  from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience.&nbsp; We may establish programs with advertising  partners and other websites in which they share information with us, such as, ask  advertisers to tell us how our Members responded to the ads we showed them (and  for comparison purposes, how other Members who didn’t see the ads acted on  their website). This data sharing, commonly known as “conversion tracking,”  helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the  advertisements you see. We may receive information about whether or not you’ve  seen or interacted with certain ads on other websites in order to measure the  effectiveness of those ads.&nbsp; If in any of  these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we will within 180  days, stop associating Personal Information received with any particular Member.  If we institute these programs, we will only use the information in accordance  with this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <br>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><h4>E. Information from Other Members </h4></li>

Additionally, we use your email  address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends  you a personal message) or notifications from a social network or other website  with whom you have registered to receive such notifications. </p><br>
        <p>You may indicate your preference  to stop receiving further promotional communications.&nbsp; If you would rather not receive promotional  e-mails from us, please see the section below labeled Opt-Out.&nbsp; We reserve the right to send you certain  communications relating to zuuzs.com services, such as service announcements  and administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of  receiving them.

        <h2>Who Sees Your Personal Information</h2>
        <ol style="padding-left:20px;">
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><h3>1. Our Employees</h3></li>
        <p>Only a very limited number of  zuuzs.com employees ever have access to your Personal Information. This  information is used to track and send fundzs you earn.</p>
        <br>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><h3>2. Our Members</h3></li>
        <p>When you use zuuzs.com, certain  information you post or provide through zuuzs.com, such as your name, profile,  picture, comments, collections and reviews, may be shared with other Members  and posted on publicly available portions of zuuzs.com, including without  limitation, social media applications and other public forums in which you  choose to participate. Please keep in mind that if you choose to disclose  Personal Information when posting comments or other information or content  through zuuzs.com, this information may become publicly available and may be  collected and used by others, including people outside of zuuzs.com. We will  not have any obligations with respect to any information that you post to parts  of zuuzs.com available to others, and recommend that you use caution when  giving out Personal Information to others through social media networks or otherwise.</p>
        <br>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><h3>3. Use for Research</h3></li>
        <p>In addition to the uses outlined  above, by using zuuzs.com, you agree to allow us to anonymously use the  information from you and your experiences to continue our consumer research  objectives. The findings of our research may be sold to third parties or  published in industry publications. However, such research will be conducted on  an anonymous basis, and no Personal Information will be published or sold. This  Privacy Policy does not limit our use or disclosure of any Anonymous Information  in any way, and we reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information  to our partners, advertisers and other third parties in our discretion.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><h3>6. Disclosure of Anonymous Information to Trusted  Third Parties By Us</h3></li>
        <p>We may share your Anonymous  Information with third parties, but not in a manner that would reveal your  identity. We may share your Personal Information, sometimes in conjunction with  your Anonymous Information, with service providers that may be associated with  us to perform functions on our behalf. For example, outsourced customer care  agents or technology assistants may need access to your information to perform  services for you. Your information will be treated as private and confidential  by such service providers and not used for any other purpose than we authorize.  In addition, from time to time, we may share Anonymous Information about our Member  base with carefully selected third parties, so they can offer products and  services that we believe may be of interest to our Members. </p>

If you choose to accept any such offers, you may either  (depending on the situation) directly provide your information in connection  with the offer to such third party provider, or we will provide your  information, including billing information, to the third party provider by  pre-populating the offer registration forms. Your information will not be  transferred until you actually accept the offer. You may opt-out of the offer  at any time up until your acceptance. Please refer to the third party  provider’s own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any  questions regarding how your information is used by such providers. Please be  aware that these offers may be presented on pages framed by zuuzs.com. Although  these offer pages have the look and feel of zuuzs.com, you will be submitting  your information directly to the third-party advertiser. You agree that we will  not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the  result of any such dealings, including the sharing of the information you  supply to us with third party providers described here, or as the result of the  presence of such providers on zuuzs.com.</p>
        <br>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><h3>8. Protection of zuuzs.com and Others</h3></li>
        <p>We release account and other Personal  Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law;  enforce or apply our <a href="/about/terms/">Terms of  Service</a> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of  zuuzs.com, our Members, or others.
