					<b>Privacy Policy<br>
					</b>&nbsp;<br>
					Jhoos is respectful of privacy concerns of the visitors 
					to its sites on the Internet. Information about our 
					customers is an important part of our business and we treat 
					individual customer information as confidential. As a 
					general policy, no personal information is automatically 
					collected from visitors to this site. However, certain 
					non-personal information about visitors is recorded by the 
					standard operation of Jhoos Internet servers. This 
					information is primarily used to provide an enhanced online 
					experience for the visitor. Information tracked includes the 
					type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Netscape, 
					Internet Explorer, Firefox and other Mozilla flavors), the 
					type of operating system (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) in use 
					by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor's Internet 
					service provider (e.g., Yahoo, MSN, America Online, etc.). 
					By having this information, web pages optimized for a 
					particular visitor's computer may be automatically made 
					available to that visitor. Other use of this information may 
					include internal review of the number of visitors to this 
					site, but only in aggregate and in a 
					non-personally-identifiable form. Email addresses and other 
					personally identifiable data about the visitor to this site 
					are known to Jhoos only when voluntarily submitted by the 
					user.<br>
					<br>
					When you sign up for or inquire about Jhoos services, you 
					may provide us with information that is associated with your 
					personal identity, such as your name, service address, 
					telephone number(s), social security number or driver's 
					license number, premium service subscription information, 
					user IDs, passwords, email address, billing and payment 
					information, customer correspondence and communications 
					records, maintenance and repairs, and other service-related 
					information. To the extent that you request or subscribe to 
					Jhoos products and services, you may also provide (or we 
					may electronically collect) information about your computer, 
					as well as your configurations. We may also collect 
					Information from visitors or customers who respond to e-mail 
					surveys. All personal information that we collect is treated 
					as confidential.<br>
					<br>
					Use of IP Addresses<br>
					An IP address is a unique sequence of numbers that is 
					automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are 
					connected to the Internet. Web servers - - the public 
					computers that "serve up" Web pages - - automatically 
					identify your computer by the IP address which you have been 
					assigned.<br>
					<br>
					Jhoos collects IP addresses for the purposes of system 
					administration, to report aggregate information, and to 
					audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from 
					Jhoos sites, our servers log the guests' IP address. We 
					do not normally link the IP address to anything personally 
					identifiable, which means that a user's session will be 
					logged but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will 
					use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is 
					necessary to enforce compliance with our Acceptable Usage 
					Policy or Terms of Service or to protect our service, site, 
					customers, or others.<br>
					<br>
					Some services within Jhoos, such as certain message 
					boards, may display IP addresses along with the message 
					poster's name and message. Please review each service prior 
					to use and only use those that disclose information you are 
					comfortable with sharing.<br>
					<br>
					Use of Cookies<br>
					What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a 
					web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for 
					record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web surfing easier for 
					you by saving your preferences while you are at our site. We 
					never save passwords or credit card information in cookies.<br>
					<br>
					By showing how and when a guest uses a site, cookies help us 
					see which areas are popular and which are not. Many 
					improvements and updates to the site are based on such data 
					as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This 
					information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the 
					information from cookies to provide services that are 
					tailored to our user's needs.<br>
					<br>
					While these activities may depend on the use of a cookie, 
					visitors to the Jhoos website always have the option of 
					disabling cookies via their browser preferences. Most 
					browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can 
					reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a 
					cookie is being sent. Use of cookies allows you to take full 
					advantage of Jhoos.com's best features. Please note that 
					some of the parts of Jhoos.com's web site may not 
					function properly or may be considerably slower if you 
					refuse cookies and, for all of these reasons, we recommend 
					that you leave them turned on.<br>
					<br>
					Security<br>
					The importance of security for all personally identifiable 
					information associated with our guests is of utmost concern 
					to us. We exercise great care in providing secure 
					transmission of your information from your PC to our 
					servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the 
					Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, 
					while we strive to protect your personal information, 
					Jhoos cannot insure or warrant the security of any 
					information you transmit to us or from our online products 
					or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive 
					your transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its 
					security on all of our systems.<br>
					<br>
					A Special Note to Parents<br>
					Children must get permission from their parents before 
					sending any information about themselves (such as their 
					names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the 
					Internet, to Jhoos or anyone else. Jhoos will not 
					knowingly allow anyone under 13 to register with any of its 
					sites, to order Jhoos services or products online, or to 
					access those features that require registration. 
					Jhoos.com does not sell products for purchase by 
					children. We may sell children's products for purchase by 
					adults. Jhoos believes that parents should supervise 
					their children's' online activities and consider using 
					parental control tools available from online services and 
					software manufacturers that help provide a child friendly 
					online environment. These tools can also prevent children 
					disclosing online - their name, address, and other personal 
					information, without parental permission. For additional 
					information about parental control tools, please consult the 
					"Consumer Assistance" page of the Direct Marketing 
					Association home page (http://www.the-dma.org). </td>
