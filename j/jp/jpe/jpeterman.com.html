<br>

policies. We may change this policy from time to time without notice therefore 
we recommend you check back periodically to ensure you are comfortable with our 
most recent policy. Immediately after we post any changes to this policy, those 
changes are deemed effective, whether or not you have reviewed them. By using 
our website after we post any changes to this policy, you agree to accept those 
changes. If at any time you choose not to accept this Privacy Policy, please do 
not use our website. This document is organized as follows: <br>
<br>
1. What information do we collect?<br>

3. How do we store this information?<br>
4. Do we collect personal information of young children?<br>
5. How can you edit your personal information?<br>
6. How can you access us from outside the U.S.?<br>
7. How do you contact us?<p></p>
<br>
<b>1. What information do we collect?</b><br>
<br>
You may submit personal information to our website in numerous ways. First, you 
may share your name, email address and certain information about your likes and 
dislikes when you sign up for our website, or request a newsletter. We collect 
information when you register or update your account, log-in, place an order, 
opt-in to receive our emails, shop online, request a catalog, or participate in 
a contest, promotion or survey. This information may include, but is not limited 
to, name, email address, billing and shipping address, credit card information 
and phone number. You may also provide personal information when you post 
comments to jpeterman.com, or to one of our other branded sites. In addition, if 
you have registered with another of our owned and operated sites, we will have 
any personal information about you that you provided at the sister site(s) as 
well. Whether or not you provide personal information is your choice; however, 
sometimes it may be required to participate in a particular activity or gain 
access to certain content on our sites.<br>
<br>
We also automatically collect general information, or what we call non-personal 
information, from you when you access our website. This information can include, 
among other things, the type of browser you are using, the third party website 
from which your visit originated, the operating system you are using, the domain 
name of your Internet service provider, the search terms you use on our website, 
the specific web pages you visit, and the duration of your visits.<br>
<br>
<b>2. How do we use this information?</b><br>
<br>
We will not sell, rent or share your email address with third parties to send 
you unsolicited email. However, in our ongoing effort to provide you with the 
best service possible, we may share your information with our other brands 
within our company.<br>
<br>
When you supply your postal address, either when requesting a catalog or placing 
an order, you may receive a catalog by mail from us or one of our other brands. 
We occasionally make our postal list available for limited use by a few 
reputable and carefully screened firms, but at your request, we will not share 
your postal address with anyone. Requests can be sent to the
<a href="/contact-us.asp">contact us</a> page.
<br>
<br>
When you place an order on jpeterman.com, we use this information to process and 
track your order and contact you via email, postal mail or phone if we have any 
questions or concerns regarding your order. If you provide an email address 
during checkout, you will also receive order and shipping confirmation emails.
<br>
<br>
We also maintain a record of your purchases made on our site and through our 
family of websites and combine this with information you have provided over the 
phone in order to serve you better. We may combine information you provide with 
demographic information, information gathered from our other brands and 
affiliated companies, and information that is publicly available. We may also 
use information about your product preferences and interests in order to improve 
our site design and enhance your shopping experience.<br>
<br>
When we offer contests, promotions or surveys, you may be required to provide 
certain personal information so we can notify winners and/or fulfill promotional 
obligations. In these instances, you have the option to receive emails or other 
communications from us regarding our products, services, contests, and 
promotions. Even if you have previously chosen not to receive email or postal 
mail from us, you may still receive information as it relates to the contest, 
promotion or survey in which you have participated. <br>
<br>
We see the task of safeguarding your personal information as an important one. 
The situations explained below are the only times where we may share your 
personal information with a third party outside of the company or an approved 
vendor of the company performing a specific task or function on behalf of the 
company (and these companies will not own or control your personal data on a 
permanent basis and they can only use your data for the task assigned to them by 
the company). Those situations are as follows:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1. in response to a legal process and/or where we (or an enforcement agency) 
believe your actions may violate applicable laws, or where we believe your 
actions threaten the rights, property or safety of our company, its users (or 
the general public).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2. you volunteered your personal information to the general public while 
participating in certain activities on our website, for example, forums, posts, 
and/or reviews. We cannot control the actions of our site users and recommend 
you consider this prior to sharing any personal information with the general 
community on our site.<br>
<br>
We may also use an approved J. Peterman vendor to help us analyze general 
information about your visit to our site, which is used by us to understand your 
shopping experience and preferences. One of our approved vendors may place a 
unique cookie on your browser, and may also use other monitoring technologies to 
create anonymous statistics about our website visitors. We also use non-personal 
information to analyze site traffic, audience trends, etc, and may use an 
approved J. Peterman vendor to help us complete these tasks as well.<br>
<br>
We may also send you marketing emails. At various points on our site you have 
the option to join our email list. Also, if you provide us with your email 
address either on the home page, when you register, place an order, enter a 
contest or during checkout, you may automatically be added to our email list as 
well and receive marketing or promotional information from us or one of our 
other brands. If you do not wish to receive our marketing emails, you may 
opt-out by clicking on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of all our 
marketing emails, or requests can be sent to the
<a href="/contact-us.asp">contact us</a> page. <br>
<br>
<b>3. How do we store information?<br>
</b><br>
We take steps consistent with commercially reasonable industry standards to 
assure that any personal information collected from you is secured from loss, 
misuse or unauthorized access while under our control. Please note that despite 
our efforts to protect information provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such 
information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances 
or by the unauthorized acts of others.<br>
<br>
<b>4. Do we collect personal information from children? </b><br>
<br>
Our website is not intended for children, and the website will not knowingly 
collect personal information from children under 13. We do not sell products for 
purchase by children and all children's products we sell are for purchase by 
adults only.<br>
<br>
<b>5. How can you edit your personal information?</b><br>
<br>
At any time, you can edit your personal information during the registration 
process, and as often as you like. Anyone who experiences problems with our 
service, or just has questions about our service, please contact us at the
<a href="/contact-us.asp">contact us</a> page. <br>
<br>
<b>6. How can you access us from outside the U.S.?</b><br>
<br>
If you are visiting jpeterman.com from a location outside of the United States, 
you will be connected through and to servers located within the United States. 
All jpeterman.com orders will be accepted and fully processed in and shipped
