                    <h3>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
                    The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679">GDPR law</a> is the European law that regulates the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en">privacy rights of users from the European Economic Area (EEA)</a>. Our Declaration of Conformity can be found <a href="/downloads/gdpr/declaration_of_conformity.pdf">here</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    GDPR’s main principle is that users own their personal data, and the companies have the obligation to make the right steps to facilitate the users’ rights:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>to know what personal data companies collect, how they store this info and for how long</li>
                        <li>to know if the personal data is shared with third parties</li>

                        <li>to delete the personal data</li>
                        <li>to correct the personal data</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Terms used in this document: We, users, third parties.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>JpegReducer is the provider of the service, referred sometimes as <u>we</u>.</li>
                        <li>By users we understand all the users of our tools and service, and also, the visitors of our site that compresses images through our online image compressor.</li>
                        <li>Visitors are those who browse the web pages of JpegReducer.</li>
                        <li>Customers are the users that purchased paid plans.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h4>1. What personal data we collect and how we collect it</h4>
                    <br><br>
                    From the visitors of our site <a href="http://JpegReducer.com">http://JpegReducer.com</a>, we collect the following data: IPs, location, browser type, visited pages.
                    <br><br>
                    When images are optimized via our <a href="https://JpegReducer.com/">online compressor</a>, we store them for two hours, together with the optimization details. After that, we delete the images, but we keep the info for 40 days.
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>2. What we do with the collected personal data</h4><br>
                    <h5>Customer Support</h5>
                    In order to help our customers we need to use their personal data:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal data needed for debugging reasons: the domain from where the images are, optimization parameters (file name and size, the time of the optimization).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Running the service</h5>
                    For the proper running of our image optimization service we keep:
                    IPs, country of origin, Browser, number of images and PDF files,
                    the names of the images and PDF files, the URLs of the images and PDF files, URIs (domains), PHP version.
                    We need this info to connect our servers to our clients’ servers, where the images needing compression are hosted.
                    The info is also needed for maintenance and for building appropriate tools for our clients.

                    <br><br>
                    <h5>Information campaigns</h5>
                    We send emails to inform our users about new features, service changes (including Terms and Conditions &amp; Privacy Policy updates), interruptions of our service, possible errors or bugs. These messages are an important part of our communication with our users.

                    <br><br>
                    <h5>Marketing campaigns</h5>
                    We send newsletters to our users about deals and promotions. Our marketing campaigns could promote other services as well, if we believe that they are compatible with our service, and that they could be useful for our users. We try to keep these types of messages at a maximum of two emails per user/ each month.

                    <br><br>
                    <h4>3. How long do we keep your personal data?</h4>
                    The details of the files processed by our service (names, URLs, optimization parameters, file size, processing date) are stored for 40 days. Each user can access these records from their JpegReducer account, and they can also download a spreadsheet document called an optimization report.
                    <br><br>
                    IPs, email addresses, API keys, and usage data are stored indefinitely. Users have the right to ask us to delete their private data, even if this could mean the termination of the service we provide them due to technical reasons.
