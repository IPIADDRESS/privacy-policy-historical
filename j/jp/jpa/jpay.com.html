									JPay requires you to provide information about yourself and your credit card and/or

									Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how your personal information will

									If you contact us we may keep a record of that correspondence and incorporate 
									the information it contains into our database. 
									Information provided by you to open a JPay account, such as your name, 
									address, phone number, and Bank card information are retained in the JPay database. 
									Additional information concerning each transaction, such as the amount of the 
									transaction or inmate information such as inmate’s ID or inmate’s last name, 
									are also stored in the JPay database. <br><br>
									We ask for your email address to serve as your username. 
									We will only use your email address to notify you of any service announcements 
									related to your account. We do not send out any newsletter or promotional emails. <br><br>
									Every time someone visits our web site a log file is generated on our computer. 
									This contains information such as the user's IP (Internet Protocol) address, 
									how long that user spent on the site, 
									and which pages of the Web site they visited. 
									We collect this information to help us diagnose problems and administer our systems, 
									to report aggregate information to our advertisers, 
									and to audit the use of our site (e.g. what part of the world users are connecting from, 
									or what ISPs are being used). <br><br>
									We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, 
									which means that you remain anonymous even though we include your IP address in our 
									aggregate information. However, we can and will attempt to use IP addresses to identify 
									a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our User Agreement, 
									or to protect our services and other users, and respond to law enforcement. 
									We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by 
									law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or 
									to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. <br>

									Cookies are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to 
									recognize you as a JPay customer if you return to the JPay site using the same

									personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 
									We send a session cookie to your computer if and when you log in to your JPay 
									account by entering your email address and password. These cookies allow us to 
									recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, 
									so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. 
									Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect.

									In order to protect all our customers from potential fraud, 
									we verify the information you provide us with third parties. 
									The verification process allows JPay to collect specific information 
									about you in order to safeguard your personal information and any 
									information related to a transaction. In particular, 
									if you register a Bank card with JPay, we will use card authorization and 
									fraud screening services to verify that your 
									card information and address matches the information that you supplied to JPay, 
									and that the card has not been lost or stolen. 
									Inmate information provided to us is validated against the appropriate prison inmate’s database. <br><br>
									JPay will only disclose personally identifiable information to third parties under 
									the following circumstances. 
									JPay shares information with companies that help us process transactions such 
									as credit card processors. 
									These third parties are not allowed to use your information for any secondary purposes. 
									JPay may also disclose information that we in good faith believe is necessary to investigate fraud 
									or illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our User Agreement. 
									JPay will disclose information requested by a regulatory or government authority 
									investigating illegal activities. Similarly, we will disclose your personal information 
									whereby our company or business assets are transferred to a third party or if we are 
									compelled to do so by law. <br>

									In the event JPay Inc. goes through a business transition, such as a merger,
