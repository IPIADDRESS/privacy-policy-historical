<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><b><span class="regularf">Privacy Policy</span></b></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">This
Privacy Policy governs your JPay account and any information you provide to
JPay on this site, on transaction forms or when you speak to a JPay
representative. In order to use the JPay service and to reduce the risk of
fraud, JPay requires you to provide information about yourself and your credit
card and/or debit card (“Bank card”). JPay is committed to safeguarding your
privacy online. Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how your personal
information will be collected and used by JPay. This policy was last updated
February 19, 2010.</span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><b><span class="regularf">Information
We Collect and Use</span></b></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">We
collect personal information to process transactions, provide products and
services, and administer our business. If you contact us we may keep a record
of that correspondence and incorporate the information it contains into our
database. Information provided by you to open a JPay account, such as your
name, address, phone number, Bank Card information and such other information
we may collect are retained in the JPay database. Additional information
concerning each transaction, such as the amount of the transaction or inmate
information such as inmate’s ID or inmate’s last name, are also stored in the
JPay database.</span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">Every
time you visit our web site a log file is generated which contains information
such as your IP (Internet Protocol) address, detail about which pages of
JPay.com you visited and for how long. We collect this information to help us
diagnose problems and administer our systems, to report aggregate information
to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site (e.g. what part of the
world users are connecting from, or what ISPs are being used). Use of this
information for marketing purposes will always be in compliance with the
applicable law regarding customer consent. </span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">We
do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which
means that you remain anonymous even though we include your IP address in our
aggregate information. However, we can and will attempt to use IP addresses to
identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our <a id="uclPrivacyPolicy_lnkUserAgreement" href="javascript:__doPostBack('uclPrivacyPolicy$lnkUserAgreement','')"><font color="Red">User Agreement</font></a>, comply with
a governmental request or to protect our services and other users. </span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><b><span class="regularf">Cookies</span></b></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">Cookies
are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you
as a JPay customer if you return to the JPay site using the same computer and
browser. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally
identifiable information you submit while on our site. We send a session cookie
to your computer if and when you log in to your JPay account by entering your
email address and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you
visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't
need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your
browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect. You are
free to decline cookies if your web browser permits, but you may not be able to
use all the features and the functionality of our website. </span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><b><span class="regularf">Verification and Disclosure of Information</span></b></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">In
order to protect all of our customers from potential fraud, we verify the
information you provide us with third parties. The verification process allows
JPay to collect specific information about you in order to safeguard your
personal information and any information related to a transaction. In
particular, if you register a Bank Card with JPay, we will use card
authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information
and address matches the information that you supplied to JPay, and that the
card has not been lost or stolen. Inmate information provided to us is
validated against the appropriate correctional institution’s inmate database. </span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">JPay
will only disclose personally identifiable information to third parties under
the following circumstances. JPay shares information with companies that help
us process transactions such as credit card processors, Wire Transfer Money Order
merchants or banking authorities. These third parties are not allowed to use
your information for any secondary purposes. JPay may also disclose information
that we in good faith believe is necessary to investigate fraud or illegal
activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our User Agreement.
JPay will disclose information requested by a regulatory or government
authority investigating illegal activities. Similarly, we will disclose your
personal information whereby our company or business assets are transferred to
a third party or if we are compelled to do so by law. </span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><b><span class="regularf">Business
Transitions</span></b></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">In
the event JPay goes through a business transition, such as a merger,
acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your
personally identifiable information will likely be amongst the assets
transferred. The surviving company, or the acquiring company in the case of a
sale of assets, would have access to personal information which would continue
to be subject to this Privacy Policy. You will be notified via email or through
a prominent notice on our website of any such change in ownership or control affecting
your personal information.</span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><b><span class="regularf">How
We Protect Information</span></b></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">JPay
is committed to taking every necessary precaution to protect your information.
We employ physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect customer
information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
JPay restricts access to your personally identifiable information to employees
who need to know that information in order to provide services for you. Your
account information is stored only in encrypted form on offline computers. JPay
continually reviews and enhances its security systems and physical access
control procedures.</span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">There
are areas of our website where you may be asked to transmit Bank Card information
in order to complete a transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we
ask for Bank Card information, it will be transmitted in an encrypted format
using industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) 3.0/TLS (transport layer
security) 1.0 encryption. </span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><b><span class="regularf">How
You Can Help Us Protect Your Information</span></b></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">Remember
to log out and close your browser window when you have finished using JPay’s
services. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information
and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a
computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. We cannot ensure or
warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at
your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to
ensure its security on our systems. </span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><b><span class="regularf">External
Links</span></b></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">This
site contains links to other sites and if you decide to follow those links,
JPay will not be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those
websites. </span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><b><span class="regularf">Changes
to this Privacy Policy</span></b></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">If
we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy
Policy, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what
information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we
disclose it. </span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">We
may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a revised version on our
website. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. In addition,
if the revised version contains a substantial change, we will email you the
substantial change prior to posting it on our website.</span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><b><span class="regularf">Updating
Your Information</span></b></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><span class="regularf">If
your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire to
use our service, you may email our Customer Support Team at <a href="mailto:support@jpay.com">support@jpay.com</a>. </span></p>

<p class="pgraphNoLeftMarg"><b><span class="regularf">Contacting
