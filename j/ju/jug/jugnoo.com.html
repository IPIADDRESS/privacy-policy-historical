			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
              <p>This Privacy Statement explains how Jugnoo Inc. ("we", "us", "our" or "Jugnoo") collects, uses and shares your "Personal Information" - information that identifies, relates to, describes or is capable of being associated with you as a particular individual, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number - and other data through your use of any of Jugnoo's Web sites, services, code, application programming interfaces ("APIs"), software development kits ("SDKs") and/or software (collectively, the "Services"). </p>
              <p>By accessing the Services, you accept this Privacy Statement, agree to the terms, conditions and notices contained or referenced herein as well as in Jugnoo's Terms of Use located at [www.jugnoo.com/terms] (the "TOU"), and you consent to collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as described herein. Any capitalized term used, but not defined, herein, has the meaning given to it in the TOU. </p>
              <p>As a general rule there are two categories of users of the Services: "Publishers" who are operators or publishers of websites that integrate and make the Services, such as the code, APIs, SDKs and web toolbar platform, available on their website, and "End Users" who are individual visitors of a website and who interact with Publishers through Services (collectively, "you"). </p>
              <h3>What Information We Collect</h3>
              <p>We collect two types of Personal Information: (i) personally identifiable information ("PII"), which constitutes any information that can identify an individual directly or through other reasonably available means and is otherwise referred to herein as "personal information", but does not include information deemed not to be personal information in accordance with applicable law; and (ii) non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII"), which is also referred to as aggregate and anonymous data, or is information that would not, in and of itself, identify you.  Please note that what one may initially consider to be Non-PII may, in some contexts, such as in respect of small geographic locations or communities, result in such information being attributable to you or allowing you to be identified because of the context.  Please consider this when providing information.</p>
              <h3>What Information We Ask You For </h3>
              <p>When you register with the Services as a Publisher, you will be asked to provide us with certain PII about yourself such as your first name, last name, address, gender, date of birth, email address, company name, website and business type.</p>
              <p>When you register with the Services as an End-User, you will be asked to provide us with certain PII about yourself such as your first name, last name, display name, gender, date of birth, email address and address.</p>
              <p>You may also import your account information from a third party API to make the registration process easier. If you do so, we will collect information from such third party and may ask that you provide additional information in the event we are not able to access required information from the API. </p>
              <h3>What Information We Automatically Gather </h3>
              <p>Some Non-PII is automatically collected when you use or visit the Services. We collect and store information related to your use of the Services, such as the pages you view on the website, and information pertaining to your computer device, network, protocols and software and the date and time of your visit. The Non-PII we automatically collect is used to help us provide a more relevant and useful site experience to you. This information is also used in the aggregate to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the Services. </p>
              <p>The Non-PII is typically collected through "cookies". A cookie is a small piece of information that can be stored by your web browser on your hard drive. We use "persistent cookies" to store your Credentials for future logins to the Services. When you revisit the Services, our server will recognize the cookie and collect the aforementioned information. We also use the same mechanism on the mobile side for caching User credentials through our component enclosed in your application. Additionally cookies are used to help us analyze the Services usage more accurately by keeping tracks of User interaction. Our cookies do not collect your name, email address, contact information or other PII. If you are uncomfortable with our practice of using cookies, you can disable all cookies through your browser settings; however, if you disable cookies, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services. </p>
              <h3>What Other Information May Be Collected</h3>
              <p>Public profile. If you choose to create a profile on the Services, certain information in your profile will be publicly available.

In addition, you can contribute to the Services in a number of different ways, including by adding content, such as photographs, posts etc. ("Content"). We may store these contributions (your "Public Profile"), display them to other users, and use them for promotional or analytical purposes. Note that if you include PII in your Public Profile, it can be used and viewed by others. We are not responsible for the information you choose to include in your Public Profile. Please note that you will not be able to sign-in, post any Content or access any of your personal information once your account is closed or suspended. </p>
