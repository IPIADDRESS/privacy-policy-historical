            At Juno, we want the people who use our services to have the best 
            possible Internet experience. This means more than just providing 
            compelling features and reliable service. It also means giving our 
            users a sense of comfort with regard to their use of our services 
            and the privacy of the personal information they share with us. To 
            accomplish this goal, we have strict privacy policies designed to 
            protect subscribers to our Internet access services and everyone who 
            visits our World Wide Web site (our services and site are referred 
            to collectively as the "Service"; our site by itself is referred to 
            as the "Site").<br>
            <br>
            This Privacy Statement summarizes our privacy and information use 
            policies and, together with our Service Agreement and Guidelines for 
            Acceptable Use, governs your use of the Service. While this Privacy 
            Statement applies to the whole Service rather than only to the Site, 
            because TRUSTe only certifies Web site privacy policies, the TRUSTe 
            certification mentioned below pertains only to the portions of this 
            Privacy Statement that apply to the Site. This Privacy Statement, 
            the Service Agreement and the Guidelines supersede all prior communications 
            and agreements with regard to their subject matter; the current version 
            of each may be found at Juno's Web site at <a href="http://help.juno.com/policies/">http://help.juno.com/policies/</a>. 
            Our privacy policies may change from time to time, and if they do, 
            any changes will be posted in this Privacy Statement before taking 
            effect. We will not use any personal information collected on the 
            Site in a manner different from that stated at the time the information 
            is collected, without first notifying you by e-mail (at which time 
            we would also notify you of how you can "opt out" of such use). While 
            we expect to notify our subscribers (by e-mail or through other means) 
            of any significant changes to the Privacy Statement, you should check 
            this Web page periodically to be sure you are familiar with our current 
            policies. <br>

              we never provide third parties with information about personal usage 
              characteristics in conjunction with information that might identify 
              you. To help our partners understand how visitors use our Site, 
              we may share certain information about our Site with them. This 
              information is normally disclosed in the aggregate, meaning that

              Juno takes great care to ensure its users' privacy -- but not every 
              company has comparable policies. Other than Juno's own Site, no 
              site on the Web is under Juno's control, and Juno cannot assume 
              any responsibility for any other site's content or practices. Providers 
              of Internet sites or services have separate data and privacy practices 
              independent of Juno that govern the manner in which they use the 
              information that you provide to them. Many Web sites use cookies 
              to recognize you when you return to their site; some sites require 
              that you provide information before they allow you to enter; some 
              automatically gather information when you visit, such as what operating 
              system your computer runs, what type of Web browser you use, what 
              Internet access provider you use, or what other Web pages you visit; 
              and sites vary greatly (from each other and from Juno) with regard 
              to how they use such information and to whom they disclose it. We 
              encourage you to read third parties' privacy policies, and to exercise 
              care each time you are asked to provide personal information at 
              a site whose privacy policies you don't know. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even within 
              Juno's Site, many of the features and much of the content is supplied 
              by third parties (or jointly by Juno and one or more third parties), 
              each of which has its own privacy policies and practices, and the 
              Site may link to some pages provided by third parties that are "co-branded" 
              by Juno and the provider. You may be asked to provide personal information 
              when you register for certain services or promotions on our Site; 
              in such cases, the information you provide may be collected and 
              used by a third party rather than, or in addition to, Juno. Our 
              policy requires such third parties to notify you in advance if they 
              intend to use information you provide for purposes unrelated to 
              the services or promotions for which you sign up, and to give you 
              the opportunity to choose not to use their service rather than share 
              your information with them, but we cannot assume responsibility 
              for their compliance with our policy.</font></p>

              too often, and these cookies also may collect information about

              Member Profile helps us personalize your Internet experience.</b></font><br>
              All subscribers to our free basic service must complete a Member 
              Profile containing questions about their interests and demographics, 
              among other topics. People who sign up directly for one of our billable 
              premium services are encouraged, but not required, to complete a 
              Member Profile as well. All subscribers are expected to keep the 
              information in their Member Profile up to date. (For instructions 
              on how to update your Member Profile, see "You can change your Member 
              Profile at any time," below.) In addition, we may collect further 
              information from time to time through supplemental surveys.<br>
              <br>
              We use the information our subscribers provide to personalize their 
              Internet experience and to meet the needs of our advertisers. For 
              example, while all our members see advertisements, they don't all 
              have to see the <i>same</i> advertisements. If we know that a particular 
              user loves to ski, we might show her an ad for winter vacations; 
              a user who indicates that he has young children might see an ad 
              for pre-school toys. By targeting content in this way, we can make 
              it more likely that the marketing messages and offers on Juno are 
              of interest to the people who see them, which serves both our subscribers' 
              and our advertisers' interests. You agree that we may use Member 
              Profile and other information you provide or relating to your use 
              of the Service to, among other things, facilitate the distribution 
              of information to you by others and administer the Site and maintain 
              and improve the Service.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may disclose 
              to advertisers or other third parties <i>statistical</i> information 
              derived through the aggregation of information you provide or relating 
              to your use of the Service with information associated with all 
              or some subset of the other subscribers to the Service -- for example, 
              we might inform an advertiser interested in marketing a product 
              on the West Coast of the number of Juno subscribers who live in 
              California -- but we will not share the names or addresses (or other 
              Identifier Information) of any of those subscribers with advertisers 
              without their consent.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will not 
              intentionally monitor or disclose any private e-mail message or 
              online communication, although we reserve the right to monitor accounts 
              that are believed to be acting in violation of the Service Agreement, 
              Guidelines for Acceptable Use, or any applicable law or regulation; 
              to protect the integrity of our Service or the Internet community

              If you want to update or correct the information in your Member 
              Profile (or to create a Member Profile if you're a premium service 
              subscriber who wishes to do so), just click on the word "Options" 
              at the top of the Juno screen and then select "Update Member Profile" 
              from the menu that drops down. Any changes you make will be sent 
              to us the next time you connect to Juno's central computers to send 
              or receive e-mail. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Juno may keep 
              your Member Profile information and other information provided by 
              you or relating to your use of the Service for record keeping, dispute 
              resolution or auditing purposes, to send you offers we feel may 
              be of interest to you, or in order to comply with requests from 
              governmental or legal authorities. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CC0000"><b>When 
              you are ready to share your personal information, you have several 
              ways you can give your consent.</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              There may be times when you do want to share personal information 
              with an advertiser or other third party. For example, if you see 
              an advertisement for a product that interests you, you might wish 
              to receive more information about that product by mail -- or you 
              may want to purchase the product immediately. You might want to 
              sign up to get e-mail on a certain topic. Or you might decide to 
              register for a service that requires you to share some information 
              about yourself during the registration process.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will pass 
              your personal information along to a third party only with your 
              consent, and there are a number of ways in which you can give such 
              consent. By way of example, we might obtain such consent by asking 
              whether you are willing to have your Identifier Information disclosed 
              to an advertiser or other third party, or by asking whether you 
              object to the disclosure of such Identifier Information to an advertiser 
              or other third party. If we notify you before you give us certain 
              information (during the account creation process or at any other 
              time) that we intend to share the information with a third party, 
              and following such notification you choose to provide the information, 
              we will assume that you consent to our sharing it with the third 
              party as stated. And if you choose to buy goods or services through 
              the Service, we will assume that you consent to our sharing some 
              or all of your Identifier Information with the company selling, 
              providing, or shipping to your address the goods or services you 
              buy. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By way of illustration, 
              an organization you belong to - for example, the National Unicycle 
              Association (NUA) -- might wish to include a free copy of Juno along 
              with the next mailing of its monthly newsletter, not only as a service 
              to all NUA members, but to allow the NUA to save money by sending 
              membership renewal notices by e-mail to those NUA members who choose 
              to open a Juno account. In such a case, permission to release personal 
              contact information to the NUA (in this example, a Juno e-mail address) 
              might be obtained by informing each individual during the account 
              creation process that if he or she wishes to register for a Juno 
              account through the NUA, his or her Juno e-mail address will be 
              accessible not only to Juno, but to the NUA as well. An individual 
              who preferred not to share this information with the NUA would be 
              free to terminate the account creation process at that point. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In another typical 
              example, Truly Magnificent Software Corporation (TMSC) might arrange 
              to "bundle" the Juno software along with one of its (truly magnificent) 
              products, and might wish to inform its customers by mail about any 
              subsequent TMSC software upgrades or new product releases. At the 
              time of registration, each prospective member might be presented 
              with a checkbox labeled "Click here if you would prefer not to release 
              your address to TMSC." Even if TMSC were to <i>require</i> a mailing 
              address from anyone who wished to register for Juno through TMSC 
              (which is not the case for all of Juno's distribution partners), 
              the prospective Juno subscriber would be offered the option (as 
              in the case of our hypothetical unicycle enthusiasts) of declining 
              to complete the registration process as an alternative to inclusion 
              on TMSC's mailing list.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In short, there 
              are a number of different ways (only some of which have been illustrated 
              here) in which a member might grant permission for the release of 
              his or her personal information to a third party, but it is against 
              Juno's policy to release any such information to a third party in 
              the absence of such permission. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CC0000"><b>We
