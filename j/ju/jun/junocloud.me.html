			    <p class="page_details">A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.<br><br>

			    We use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on this website. Session cookies are used to keep track of you whilst you navigate this website; and persistent cookies are used to enable our website to recognise you when you visit; <br><br>

			    Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.<br><br>

			    Should you wish to opt-in to this service, our advertisers may also send you cookies.

To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you might need to use a browser plug-in if available.<br><br>

			    Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites - including this one.</p>
