<h3>16. Governing Law, Venue, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</h3>
<p>These Terms of Service will be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its principles of conflict of laws. Exclusive venue for any dispute that arises out of or relates to these Terms of Service or your use of the Website will be the state or federal courts of San Francisco, California. You agree not to bring an action in any other venue and you expressly agree to waive all objections to these venues. You expressly consent to be subject to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of California. You agree that any cause of action you have that arises out of or relates to these Terms of Service or your use of the Website must be brought by you within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise any such action by you against JUUL Labs is permanently barred.<br>
Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Website and JUUL Labs Products and services shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Website and PAX services shall be deemed passive ones that do not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that San Francisco County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.<br>
Arbitration. Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from JUUL Labs. For any dispute with JUUL Labs, you agree to first contact us via email and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that JUUL Labs has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco County, California, unless you and JUUL Labs agree otherwise. If you are an individual using JUUL Labs Products, services, or the Website for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing JUUL Labs from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.<br>
Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the Website or JUUL Labs Products or services for personal, commercial or other purposes, all claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and JUUL Labs are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind.</p>
<h3>17. Release and Waiver of Claims; Assumption of Risk</h3>
<p>YOU HEREBY AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING, WHICH IS PERMITTED BY LAW: (i) to waive any and all claims that you have or may have in the future against JUUL Labs, or any of its distributors, resulting from use of the Website and JUUL Labs Products and services; and (ii) to release JUUL Labs or any of its distributors from any and all liability from any loss, damage, injury or expense that you or any users of this Website and any JUUL Labs Products or services may suffer as a result of the use of any of the foregoing, due to any cause whatsoever, including negligence or breach of contract on the part of JUUL Labs, in the design or manufacture of the Website or of any JUUL Labs Products or services.<br>
In the event of your death or incapacity, these Terms shall be effective and binding upon your heirs, next of kin, executors, administrators, assigns and representatives.<br>
You hereby expressly waive any and all rights and benefits conferred upon you by the provisions of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of California (or any applicable analogous law), which states:<br>
A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known to him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.<br>
You and JUUL Labs understand and agree that claims or facts in addition to or different from those which are now known or believed by each of them to exist may hereafter be discovered, but it is your intention to release all claims you have or may have against JUUL Labs and any and all of its successors, subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, investors, branches or related entities, or those entities’ officers, directors, employees, stockholders, partners, members, consultants, agents, attorneys, employee benefit plans or assigns, whether those claims are known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected.</p>
