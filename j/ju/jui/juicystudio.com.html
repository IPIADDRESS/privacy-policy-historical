<p>
Juicy Studio has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following 
discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site.
</p>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p class="np">
No information is collected to pass on to third-parties. Juicy Studio is in no way interested in the real identity of 
any of the members, and allows its members to use aliases rather than their real names. The only data we do require is 
an email address. 
</p>
<h2>Email Address</h2>
<p class="np">
Email addresses are required so we can initially send you a password. You will also have an opportunity to receive Techmails, 
which will be sent to your email account. For this option, you must opt-in by selecting the <b>Receive Techmails</b> option 
in your profile. Once your account is set up, you may remove your email address from your profile if you wish. Under no 
circumstances are the email addresses passed on to a third-party. Juicy Studio does not attempt to collect email addresses 
from visitors.
</p>
<h2>IP Addresses</h2>
<p class="np">
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. 
</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p class="np">
Cookies are used solely to identify the last time a member of the board logged in. This enables us to display 
messages that have been added since you last logged on in bold. You will not receive a cookie unless you're logged in as a 
member of one of the message boards.
</p>
<h2>Responsibility</h2>
<p class="np">
Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal details. Information disclosed on the 
message boards is public information. As such, members are requested not to divulge their personal information on any of 
the message boards.
</p>
<p>
The message boards are regularly checked by Moderators, but Juicy Studio is unable to vouch for the usefulness and validity 
of information posted on the board. The messages express the views of the author, and are not necessarily those of 
Juicy Studio. 
</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p class="np">
There are several links to other sites relative to the content of Juicy Studio. Juicy Studio is in no way responsible for 
the privacy practices of these external links.
</p>
<p>
By using this Web site, you are agreeing that you will not post offensive messages, or violate any law. 
</p>
<h2>Contacting the Web Site</h2>
<p class="np">
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, 
you can contact <a href="mailto:gez@juicystudio.com?subject=Juicy%20Studio%20Privacy">gez@juicystudio.com</a>.
