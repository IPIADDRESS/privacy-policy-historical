                            Juicy Couture, Inc. and/or Liz Claiborne, Inc. and each of their respective subsidiary, parent and affiliated 
                            companies (collectively referred to herein as "Juicy") is deemed to operate this Website (the 
                            "<strong>Website</strong>").  Juicy ("<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>") 
                            recognizes that you care how information about you is used and shared. We have created this Privacy Policy to 
                            inform you what information we collect on the Website, how we use your information and the choices you have 
                            about the way your information is collected and used.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.  Your use 
                            of the Website indicates that you have read and accepted our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy 
                            Policy.  In addition, please read our <a href="?section=termsofuse" title="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a> which also govern your 
                            use of this Website.  Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply to information

                            change any portion of this Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, at any time. When we amend this Privacy Policy, 
                            we will revise the "last updated" date located at the top of this Privacy Policy.  For changes to 
                            this Privacy Policy that we consider to be material, we will place a notice on the Website by revising the 
                            link on the home page to read substantially as "Updated Privacy Policy" for a reasonable amount 
                            of time which may be up to sixty (60) days.  If you provide information to us or access or use the Website

                            <strong>Notice to California Residents / Your California Privacy Rights:</strong>  California residents 
                            are entitled once a year to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of 
                            personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior 
                            calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2009 will receive information about 2008 sharing activities). As set 
                            forth in this Privacy Policy, we comply with this law by offering our visitors the ability to tell us not 
                            to share your personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. 
                            To make such a request, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:customercare@juicycouture.com">
                            customercare@juicycouture.com</a>.  You must include this Website as the subject line, and your full name,

                        <p>
                            <strong><u>Personally Identifiable Information:</u></strong>  Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") is 
                            information that identifies you or could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your real 
                            name, address, phone number or email address).  For example, when you create an account with us, your 
                            account information is stored on this Website's server.  We may also ask you to provide us with certain 
                            PII in connection with the use of this Website, in connection with the services provided by our Customer 
                            Service Department, in connection with a brick and mortar transaction (except where prohibited by law) or 
                            in connection with an off-line promotion or sweepstakes. For example, we may ask you to provide certain 
                            PII when you register with us, place an order on the Website, choose to sign up for an email newsletter, 
                            or participate in a promotional event. This information is used to provide the products and services that 
                            you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations and to 
                            provide customer service. This information also may be used to contact you about sales, special offers and 
                            new Website features, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications in connection with 
                            this Website.  We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information, information regarding your 
                            interests or similar information.  Providing us with information about yourself is voluntary, and you can 
                            always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or 
                            participate in some of the Website's features.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, you may have the opportunity to provide us with the PII, such as name or e-mail address of 
                            a friend, such as when you choose to use any "refer a friend" or "send to a friend" 
                            function to inform someone about information or a special feature from our Website. The e-mail addresses 
                            you supply us for those activities will not be retained for other purposes unless otherwise disclosed at 
                            the time you provide such information. We encourage you to send such items only to recipients who are your 
                            friends or family or persons with whom you have a relationship so that it doesn't seem like we are "spamming" 
                            them.

                            <strong><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</u></strong> When your computer contacts our web servers 
                            (for example, when you visit this Website, or view an HTML e-mail), our web servers automatically collect 
                            Website usage information. Website usage information is non-identifying information that describes how our 
                            visitors use and navigate our Website. It can include the number and frequency of visitors to each web page 
                            and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and 
                            subsequent to visiting our Website, and IP addresses (see below for more information on IP addresses). We 
                            also may determine the applicable technology available in order to serve you the most appropriate version 
                            of a web page, e-mail or similar service. This information is used to analyze and improve this Website and 
                            to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.</p>

                            <strong><u>Use of Cookies:</u></strong>  Also, like many Websites, we use "cookies". Cookies are pieces of 
                            information that a website either transfers to your computer's hard drive or stores temporarily in your computer's 
                            memory for record-keeping purposes.  We may use cookies for a number of purposes.  For example, cookies help us 
                            to identify account holders and to optimize their shopping experience. Cookies also allow us to hold selections 
                            in a shopping cart when a user leaves this Website without checking out. When you log in at this Web site with 
                            your username and password, we will assign you a secure session id. The server then passes your information to you 
                            through this secure session id. Also, we will use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of 
                            this Website. Cookies are also used to track the identity of the Website you visited immediately prior to visiting 
                            this Website; otherwise, we do not track information about your use of other Websites. Most browsers accept cookies 
                            automatically. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, 
                            we recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping experience on 
                            this Website.  If you decline to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain 
                            features of this Website.</p>

                            a web beacon, which is sometimes also called a "clear gif", that allows us to monitor and collect 
                            certain limited information about our users, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address 
                            of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small 
                            or invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including 
                            HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor 
                            how our users navigate our Website, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many 
                            messages we sent were actually opened or acted upon. We use web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about our 
                            Website and our marketing campaigns.</p>

                            <strong><u>Use Of IP Addresses:</u></strong> An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network when you 
                            are linked to the Internet. When you request pages from this Website, our servers log your IP address. We may use IP 
                            address for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners 
                            or to audit the use of the Website.  We may associate your IP address with the PII you provide.

                            We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources, to enable us to update and 
                            correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we 
                            think will interest you.

                        <p>
                            We do not knowingly sell or ship any items ordered through this Website directly to anyone who we know to be under 
                            the age of 13, nor do we collect any PII from anyone who we know to be under the age of 13. If you are under the age 
                            of 18, you should use this Website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian and should not submit any PII to 
                            us. If we discover that a person under the age of 13 has provided Juicy with PII, Juicy will use commercially reasonable 
                            efforts to delete such person's PII from its system.

                            may be of interest to you.  We may also contact you regarding any problems or questions we have relating to your use 
                            of our Website, or, in our discretion, notify you of changes to our Privacy Policy, Terms of Use or other policy or 
                            terms that affect you and your use of our Website. We may also use information about our users, including PII, for 
                            internal purposes.

                            to you.  If you opt in to receive communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's 
                            privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy. Therefore, if you later decide that you do not want that third party to use 
                            your information, you will need to contact the third party directly.  In addition, Juicy may share your PII with third

                        </p>

                            <u><i>Third parties providing services on our behalf:</i></u> We may engage third parties to perform services in connection with 
                            the operation of our business. Examples of these services include: (a) payment processing and authorization, (b) fraud

                            duties and functions. 
                        </p>

                            <u><i>Juicy's Security:</i></u>  We may release information about our users, including PII, when legally required to do so, at

                            policies governing our Website and applicable laws.  We may also disclose such user information whenever we believe 
                            disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Juicy Couture, Inc., or any of our respective 
                            affiliates, business partners, customers or others.

                           <u><i>Aggregate Information:</i></u> We may disclose non-identifying, aggregated user statistics to third parties for a variety 
                            of purposes, including describing our services to prospective partners and other third parties. Examples of such 
                            non-personal information include the number of users who visited this Website during a specific time period or 
                            purchased a specific product through this Website.

                            in connection with such promotion, including without limitation for purposes of posting your entry with attribution 
                            or otherwise as permitted in the official rules for the promotion in question, fulfilling your prize or including 
                            your name on a winners list. Also, by entering a promotion, we may require you to consent to the use of your PII or 
                            other information, such as name, voice or likeness, in advertising, promotional and marketing materials. In addition, 
                            we may offer certain promotional content, such as a sweepstakes, sponsored by or co-branded with a third party, 
                            who may obtain the PII that you submit.

                            including without limitation PII, in connection with a corporate merger, acquisition, consolidation, the sale of a 
                            portion of our business or the sale of substantially all of Juicy's assets, or other fundamental corporate change, 
                            whatever form it may take. You will be notified via e-mail or prominent notice on our Website prior to a change of 
                            ownership or control of your personal information, if your personal information will be used contrary to this policy. 
                            For clarification and the removal of doubt, Juicy specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of

                        <p>WHAT STEPS ARE TAKEN TO KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE? </p>
                        <p>
                            We use various security measures, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, to 
                            protect personal information that we collect. If you place an order through this Website, you will 
                            be asked to set up an account and provide an email address and password. You must provide an 
                            appropriate email address and password in order to access account information. In order to help 
                            protect your personal information further, you should be careful about providing your password to 
                            others. If you wish to cancel a password, or if you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized 
                            use of a password, please contact our Customer Service Department by email at

                        <p>
                            We strive to ensure the security of your PII on our systems, including limiting access to the PII 
                            contained on our servers. Unfortunately, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and data 
                            transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot and do not ensure or 
                            warrant the security of any information you transmit to Juicy and you do so at your own risk.

                            (sometimes a few months before the offer is made), you may continue to receive some offers after you send us a

                            request as quickly as we reasonably can, but it may not be possible to update our systems immediately.  We appreciate 
                            your patience and understanding in giving us time to carry out your request.

                            and may need to contact you by phone, email, or regular mail if we have questions about your order. In addition, 
                            you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our 
                            databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.

                            If you want to opt out of having your PII shared with third parties for marketing purposes, you must consistently 
                            opt-out at each of our websites where you register and whenever you provide PII to us.  Please bear in mind that 
                            this opt-out choice for "third parties" will not apply to Juicy, Juicy licensees and/or co-branding 
                            participants, as set forth below.  Please also keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply in 
                            situations where (a) you either have made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for information 
                            from us, or (b) Juicy uses your PII for either operational purposes (e.g. to complete transactions requested by you, 
                            or to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our websites, 
                            including any future changes to this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use, or any other policy or terms that affect you 
                            and your use of our Website) or fulfillment purposes (e.g. sharing with companies that facilitate communications and 
                            transactions with you).

                        <p>
                            Finally, if you do not exercise your opt-out choices upon registration or otherwise at the time the PII is provided, it 
                            may take some time to process your opt-out choices. Our systems require time to update, and promotional mailings using 
                            PII shared before your opt-out may already be in process. Thus, your PII might continue to be shared with third parties 
                            for promotional purposes for some time after you make your request,  For similar reasons, if your PII is shared with a 
                            third party, Juicy largely or completely loses control over how that information is used.  Thus, even after you have 
                            opted out of allowing us to share your PII, you might continue to receive promotional materials from third parties 
                            unless and until you duly register your opt-out request with each third party in question.

                            Safe Harbor Principles</h5>
                        <p>
                            Liz has adopted the seven Safe Harbor Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, access, security, data 
                            integrity and enforcement with respect to Data that is collected in and transferred from countries in the EU 
                            to Liz in the United States.</p>
                        <ol class="shownumbers">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Notice.</strong> This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy informs individuals about the purposes
                                for which we collect and use Data, how to contact us, the parties to which that
                                information may be accessible, and the choices and means, if any, that Liz offers
                                individuals for limiting the disclosure of such Data to non-Agent third parties.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Choice.</strong> Before Liz uses Personal Data or EU Employee Data for a purpose that
                                is incompatible with the purposes for which the Personal Data or EU Employee Data
                                was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or transfers Personal Data
                                or EU Employee Data to a non-Agent third party for the purpose of allowing the non-Agent
                                third party to exercise independent control over the Personal Data or EU Employee
                                Data, the affected individuals will be given an opportunity to decline (opt out)
                                having their Personal Data or EU Employee Data so used or transferred. The same
                                choice principle shall apply to Sensitive Personal Data, but in the event that the
                                Data is Sensitive Personal Data, the affected individual's explicit consent (opt
                                in) will be obtained prior to such use or transfer.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong> Transfer.</strong> Liz may transfer Data to its Agents once it obtains assurances
                                that the relevant Agents will adequately safeguard the Data that is transferred
                                to them. Such assurances may take the form of a contract obligating the Agent to
                                provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe
                                Harbor Principles, Safe Harbor certification by the Agent, or the Agent being subject
                                to an EU data protection directive or adequacy finding. If Liz learns that an Agent
                                is using or sharing Data in a way that is contrary to the assurances obtained, we
                                will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such activity. Liz may transfer Personal
                                Data to a non-Agent third party where such transfer is consistent with the notice
                                and choice principles detailed above or as otherwise set forth in this Policy.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Access.</strong> For those individuals who duly request it, Liz will provide such individuals
                                with reasonable access to Data that it holds about them, except in those circumstances
                                that are set forth in the Safe Harbor Principles, such as when the burden or expense
                                of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual's privacy
                                or when the rights of persons other than the Data subject's would be violated and
                                except in those instances where the access being requested relates to Employee Data
                                and the person making the request is not otherwise entitled to such access under
                                the local labor or employment laws governing such person's employment. For those
                                individuals who receive access, Liz will take reasonable steps to permit such individuals
                                to correct, amend or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or
                                incomplete.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Security.</strong> Liz will take reasonable administrative, technical and physical precautions
                                to protect Data in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
                                alteration and destruction.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Data Integrity.</strong> Liz will take reasonable steps to ensure that Data that is stored
                                on its servers is used, processed and maintained in a condition that is compatible
                                with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized, subject
                                to any deficiencies in the condition of the Data that existed at the time Liz received
                                such Data.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Enforcement.</strong> With respect to Personal Data and Sensitive Personal Data, Liz will
                                assure compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles by investigating and attempting
                                to resolve complaints regarding violations of this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy directly
                                with the complainant, and in the event that the complaint cannot be resolved by
                                Liz internally, the complainant may submit the matter to binding arbitration administered
                                by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") and conducted before a sole
                                arbitrator pursuant to the Rules and Procedures established by the AAA. The arbitration
                                shall be held at a location determined by the AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures,
                                or at such other location as may be mutually agreed by the complainant and Liz.
                                The arbitrator (a) shall not have the power to award punitive damages against the
                                participant or Liz; and (b) shall have no authority to resolve claims on a class
                                or representative basis; the arbitration can decide only the complainant's and/or
                                Liz's individual claims and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims
                                of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. In the event that we
                                or such arbitrator determines that we did not comply with this Policy, we will take
                                appropriate steps to promote future compliance. If any part of this Enforcement
                                provision is deemed to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, the balance
                                of this Enforcement provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance
                                with its terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein.
                                For more information on the AAA, please visit their website at www.adr.org.

                            Principles by investigating and attempting to resolve complaints regarding violations
                            of this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy directly with the complainant, and in the event
                            that the complaint cannot be resolved by Liz internally, the complainant may submit
                            the matter to the dispute resolution program provided by the European Data Protection
                            Authorities ("DPA's") panel. Liz will then undertake to comply with any advice that
                            may be given by the DPA's in the matter.
