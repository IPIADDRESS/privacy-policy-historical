Your program made sense and I gave it a shot.  I gained 13 inches in in 12 weeks and now I can 360 dunk with 2 hands.  Every time I play people always notice.  I recommended to our coach that the whole team does the work-out cause i'm also a whole lot quicker.  Seriously...

    First of all I just want to say your Jump Manual is awesome-it's the real deal. I couldn't agree more with your training methods. I don't want to bore you with my life story... I was hell-bent on being able to dunk-it became an obsession. I bought training manuals like yours-but those that taught me to do hundreds and hundreds of repetitions. Being used to working my butt off in the gym these workouts worked me hard and I figured for sure that they'd work for me, but I saw only little improvements. I then bought [The Jump Manual] ... I went from having a hard time grabbing rim with one hand with a running start, to being able to grab with two hands with a 3-4 step start. I was surprised and glad that I was improving, but far from content. I have a HUGE reach advantage... I really appreciate it..                                                      Thanks a million                 "</i></div>

Ive done your workout for two weeks now and Ive already gained 3 inches!! If I continue doing progress like that, I can move from libero to an outside hitter.

When I was eighteen I reached a plateau on my vertical jump, no matter how much I trained or all the exercises my coaches gave me, I couldnt go an inch higher.  I was stuck at a 32 inch vertical. After reading your program and doing the exercises for just two weeks I've increased my jump 5" already, your approach to vertical jump training has already given me a great advantage and I hope it will continue doing the same.</i></div><i>  <br>  <i>Thanks man!"</i></i><br>

First off.  I really appreciate your advice and quickness to answer my email. I will def. be trying out the techniques. As for the Jump Manual...it's def. the first workout I've been on that has pushed my legs and whole core to new levels. I am currently at a weight of 160lbs [5'5"] and with this program my final set of leg press is at 810, which before I wouldn't even dreamed of doing this much. I have gained 5.5 inches on my vert. in just over 4 weeks; and anyone who has ever worked on their vert will tell you, 5.5 inches is incredibly hard to do....I'll be sending some more dunks, this is only the beginning..."</i>

  <strong><u>PUBLISHED IN NEW ENGLAND RECRUITING REPORT: </u> </strong>
  <div>Like any  all-star type game, Tuesday night’s action featured its fair share of  highlight reel plays.&nbsp; But there was a 20 second span in the midst of  the junior game that was by far the night’s most entertaining.&nbsp; It  began when Cromwell’s Isaiah Salafia streaked down the middle of the court with Windsor’s Ishmael Kalilou  being the sole defender back to protect the basket.&nbsp; Salafia elevated,  and so did Kalilou, but the mid-air contact was just enough to allow  the Cromwell star to stay air born and throw down a two handed dunk  over the top of his would-be defender..&nbsp; the crowd went nuts...<br>
    <br>
      Isaiah Salafia – His explosive dunk wasn’t the only thing to like about  his game.&nbsp; He’s a prototypical slasher who has become consistent enough  with his jumper to keep defenders honest.&nbsp; He’s a big reason why  Cromwell is one of the pre-season favorites to take the class S state  title.&nbsp;<br>

  After the first week working with Jump Manual on Sunday   I measured it again and I got about 65 cm (basically I touched the   rim without an approach)

      Quick update. I've been doing the jump program now for about 3 weeks and have already seen a noticeable improvement...  I'm pretty stoked with the results I've seen. A couple days ago after a decent warm up I was dunking with one hand consistently... was able to get fingers around the rim before, but never enough clearance to get the ball in there.

I don't know if this is really Jacob or someone that works with him. I  purchased the jump manual late summer for my 15 year old son Tanner. He  was just starting football. At the beginning of the  program, he measured his vertical at school at 27in. At that time, he  could "touch" the rim on occasion if his legs were warm, running off  one leg. We have only done 6 weeks due to basketball season  starting.  At the very beginning of basketball, they measured his vertical again.  His vertical is now 31in. He can jump off 2 feet and grab and hang on  the rim with either hand. He will begin the program again after  basketball and do a full 12 weeks. He is excited about his progress to-date. <br>
