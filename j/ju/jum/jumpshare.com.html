The information we collect from you, is disclosed only in accordance with our Terms of Service and/or this Privacy Policy.</p>

						<h5>Non-Identifying Information</h5>
						<p>Whenever you visit our Site, we may collect non-identifying information from you, such as your IP address, referring URL, browser, operating system, cookie information, and Internet Service Provider. Without a subpoena, voluntary compliance on the part of your Internet Service Provider, or additional records from a third party, this information alone cannot usually be used to identify you.</p>
						<p>In addition to the above cookies, cookies from third party advertisers may also be installed on your computer. Please consult the relevant advertiser to learn more about your privacy rights with their organization.</p>

						<h4>3. Use of Your Information</h4>

						</ul>
						<p>Jumpshare will not access your file except when requested to do so (for example, to display it using the file viewer), for editorial reasons described in our Terms of Service, for legal purposes, or for any reason permitted by this Privacy Policy.</p>

						<h4>4. Accessing, Editing, and Removing Your Information</h4>
						<p>Users may in some cases be able to review and edit the personal information they have provided to us by logging into their account on the Site and editing their account. Although most changes may occur immediately, information may still be stored in a web browser's cache. We take no responsibility for stored information in your cache, or in other devices that may store information, and disclaim all liability of such. In addition, we may, from time to time, retain residual information about you in our backup and/or database.</p>

						<h4>5. Cookies</h4>
						<p>Throughout the course of our provision of our Service to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information. For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our website.</p>
						<p>It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy Policy when they work on behalf of Jumpshare. For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services, to the extent that the authorization is used to provide you with the Jumpshare Service.</p>
						<p>You agree that if any of these third parties commit any civil or criminal wrongs with your information, you will hold them responsible for it and not attempt to recover any damages from Jumpshare, even if the law says that Jumpshare could be held liable as well.</p>
						<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you authorize us to use Google Analytics, for general web analytics purposes.</p>

						<h4>8. Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes</h4>
						<p>At times it may become necessary, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency or a private litigant. You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.</p>

						<h4>9. Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications</h4>
						<p>By providing information to the Site that forms the basis of communication with you, such as contact information, you waive all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited email from Jumpshare since, by providing such information, you agree to receive communication from us other anyone else covered under this Privacy Policy.
