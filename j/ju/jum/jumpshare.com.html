			<span class="contact-heading">2.  Information Collected</span>
			<span class="sub-heading">Identifying Information</span>
			<p>We collect your name and e-mail address when you sign up to our Service.  Additionally, we may collect other information after signing up if it is necessary to provide you with our Service (for example, billing information if you subscribe to a paid portion of our Service).  The information we collect from you, is disclosed only in accordance with our Terms of Service and/or this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<span class="sub-heading">Non-Identifying Information</span>
			<p>Whenever you visit our Site, we may collect non-identifying information from you, such as your IP address, referring URL, browser, operating system, cookie information, and Internet Service Provider.  Without a subpoena, voluntary compliance on the part of your Internet Service Provider, or additional records from a third party, this information alone cannot usually be used to identify you.</p>
			<p>In addition to the above cookies, cookies from third party advertisers may also be installed on your computer.  Please consult the relevant advertiser to learn more about your privacy rights with their organization.</p>
			<span class="contact-heading">3.  Use of Your Information</span>
			<p>We may use your information to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Enhance or improve User experience, our Site, or our Service.</li>
				<li>Process transactions between you and Jumpshare.</li>
				<li>Send e-mails about our Site or respond to inquiries.</li>
				<li>Perform any other function that we believe in good faith is necessary to protect the security or proper functioning of our Site or Service.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Jumpshare will not access your file except when requested to do so (for example, to display it using the file viewer), for editorial reasons described in our Terms of Service, for legal purposes, or for any reason permitted by this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<span class="contact-heading">4.  Accessing, Editing, and Removing Your Information</span>
			<p>Users may in some cases be able to review and edit the personal information they have provided to us by logging into their account on the Site and editing their account.  Although most changes may occur immediately, information may still be stored in a web browser's cache.  We take no responsibility for stored information in your cache, or in other devices that may store information, and disclaim all liability of such.  In addition, we may, from time to time, retain residual information about you in our backup and/or database.</p>
			<span class="contact-heading">5.  Cookies</span>
			<p>We use cookies to save your preferences and track advertisements.  Using cookies is safer and more accurate than using an IP address alone, as more than one computer may share the same IP address.  For this reason, it is necessary that you enable cookies in your browser, and you hereby acknowledge that we have informed you of our use of cookies and that you consent to our use of cookies in relation to your computer system.</p>
			<span class="contact-heading">6.  Third Party Websites</span>
			<p>Jumpshare may post links to third party websites on its Site.  Additionally, uploaded files may not be screened or scanned for safety, and could include malicious software.  These third party sites and files may cause undesirable effects on your privacy and security, and you hereby acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to assess and assume the risk involved in accessing them, and that you release us from any liability for the conduct of these third party websites.</p>
			<p>Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to members of the Service or Site.  Jumpshare bears no responsibility for the information collected or used by any advertiser or third party website.  Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit through third party links.</p>
			<span class="contact-heading">7.  Third Party Access to Your Information</span>
			<p>Throughout the course of our provision of our Service to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information.  For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our website.</p>
			<p>It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy Policy when they work on behalf of Jumpshare.  For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services, to the extent that the authorization is used to provide you with the Jumpshare Service.</p>
			<p>You agree that if any of these third parties commit any civil or criminal wrongs with your information, you will hold them responsible for it and not attempt to recover any damages from Jumpshare, even if the law says that Jumpshare could be held liable as well.</p>
			<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you authorize us to use Google Analytics, for general web analytics purposes.</p>
			<span class="contact-heading">8.  Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes</span>
			<p>At times it may become necessary, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency or a private litigant.  You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter.  In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either.  We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities.  You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.</p>
			<span class="contact-heading">9.  Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications</span>
			<p>By providing information to the Site that forms the basis of communication with you, such as contact information, you waive all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited email from Jumpshare since, by providing such information, you agree to receive communication from us other anyone else covered under this Privacy Policy.  However, you may unsubscribe from certain communications by notifying Jumpshare that you no longer wish to receive solicitations or information and we will endeavor to remove you from the database.</p>
			<span class="contact-heading">10.  Security Measures</span>
			<p>Jumpshare.com has incorporated SSL Certificates and PCI DSS-compliant hosting into its Service for the benefit of our Users.

			<span class="contact-heading">12.  Children's Safety</span>

If you are a User who is reported in this manner, we may require you to provide suitable proof of age, such as a copy of government identification, in order to continue using our Site and/or Service.</p>
			<span class="contact-heading">13.  International Transfer</span>
			<p>Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.
