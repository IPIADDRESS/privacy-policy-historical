      <p><b>justlinux.com's PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
      <font size="">
      <p align="JUSTIFY">justlinux.com’s policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. justlinux.com will never willfully disclose our customer's personal information to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission. </p>
      <p>justlinux.com shares information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. However, we talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we will say justlinux.com’s audience is x percent females and y percent males.</p>
      <p>There are cases where justlinux.com may ask you for personal information such as your name or address. We do this when you register for contests/promotions or services that require registration or subscription. justlinux.com needs to collect this information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with justlinux.com policies as well as federal, state and local laws. When we need to use your personal information, we will ask for your permission so you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. justlinux.com users can change their account information at anytime using a browser.</p>

      <font size="+1">
      <p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>
      <font size="">
      <p>Upon registering for any of justlinux.com's services, justlinux.com sends a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It stores user data so you needn't login each time you visit justlinux.com or access your account information. </p>
      <p>Visitors to justlinux.com always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. </p>
      <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of the justlinux.com service may not function properly if you refuse cookies. For example you will not be able to register for our special services.</p>

      <font size="+1">
      <p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>
      <font size="">
      <p>Users should be aware that when you are on justlinux.com, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from justlinux.com pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or a justlinux.com search result, the "click" takes you off the justlinux.com site. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.</p>
      <p>While justlinux.com strives to protect its user’s personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.</p>
      <p>justlinux.com's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond justlinux.com's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. </p>
      <p>We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time.  Please check this page periodically for changes. </p>
