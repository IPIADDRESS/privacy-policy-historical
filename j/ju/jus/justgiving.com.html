			<h1>JustGiving’s privacy policy</h1>
			<p>Your privacy is paramount. This is how serious we are about it: we will never pass on, trade, exchange or sell your personal details to <strong>anyone</strong> without your express consent. We really mean <em>anyone</em>: not a sister company, not a ‘friendly third party’, not even the charity you are giving to.</p>

<p>There is one exception to that rule: when you build a JustGiving page, we will pass on your name, email address and postal address to the charity you have chosen to support, so that they can thank you. You can opt in to receive further communications from them if you like, but you don’t have to.</p>


<p><strong>That’s it. If you want the full, extended version, here it is:</strong></p>
