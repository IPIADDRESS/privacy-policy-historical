                                <p>
                                    At JustGiving, we are committed to ensuring the lawful collection and management of personal information. We will always keep your information secure 
                                    and manage it in accordance with our legal responsibilities under privacy and data protection laws where we operate.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This Privacy Policy provides more information about how we meet these commitments when we process personal information in connection with 
                                    the fundraising services we offer through JustGiving.com. By visiting our website or using any of our services, you agree to your personal information 
                                    being used and disclosed in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. In certain countries, we will not collect personal information from you unless you have 
                                    specifically agreed to us doing so. You do not have to provide your personal information to us, but if you do not provide certain information we may not be
                                     able to provide our services to you (for example we may not be able to process a donation).
                                </p>

                                <h2>The personal information that we collect</h2>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>If you make a donation through JustGiving.com</strong>, we will collect basic payment information to enable us to process the donation. 
                                    This will include your name, address, email address and payment card / account details, together with your unique username 
                                    and password (if you decide to become a registered user). If you are eligible for UK Gift Aid, we will also ask you to 
                                    confirm your UK domicile address as this may be different from your billing address.
                                </p>


                                <p>
                                    <strong>If you raise funds through JustGiving.com</strong>, we will collect basic contact information about you to set up the fundraising account. 
                                This will include your name, address and email address together with details of the charity, not-for-profit or JustGiving Project that 
                                you are supporting. Where you create a JustGiving Project page then we will also collect your gender, date of birth, telephone number and 
                                personal bank account details for fulfilment of the funding raised and to enable us to undertake an identity check and bank account 
                                verification with a credit reference agency, which we will ask you to consent to.  We will also ask you to register a username and 
                                password so you can gain secure access to the account in the future.
                                </p>



                                <p>
                                    If you use our fundraising tools to help tell your friends and family about a campaign you are running, 
                                    you will be asked to provide us with their contact details (or authorise us to collect these on your behalf 
                                    from your social networks). You agree that you have their agreement to provide those details to us.  It is your 
                                    responsibility to manage your campaigns responsibly. You should only contact individuals who you know would be 
                                    happy to hear from you and must not use our services to send unsolicited 'spam' messages.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    If you set up a fundraising campaign for another person, you must ensure that you have their agreement to do so, 
                                    especially if you provide us with sensitive information about them (e.g. reference to an illness or health condition).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    If you create a JustGiving Project page for a JustGiving Project which is managed by someone other than yourself, you 
                                must ensure that the manager(s) of that entity agree to you raising funding (e.g.  you are a member of a sports club and 
                                want to raise funds for a new clubhouse - you must seek the agreement of the sports club committee).
                                </p>

                                <p>For ease, you may authorise us to collect your basic personal details from a secure online source (eg Google, or sponsor charity), where you already have a registered account.</p>

                                <p>
                                    <strong>If you make a donation through JustTextGiving</strong>, your donation will be managed by Vodafone in accordance with their terms and 
                                    conditions and privacy policy. If you wish to claim the donation as UK Gift Aid, or leave a message of support on the relevant 
                                    JustGiving campaign page, you will be asked to contact JustGiving.com, in which case we will collect information about you as 
                                    explained in this Privacy Policy for other donors.
                                </p>

                                <h2>How we use personal information</h2>
                                <p>We use the personal information collected from users for a number of purposes:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>administering donations made;</li>

                                    <li>claiming Gift Aid, if applicable;</li>

                                    <li>personalising the look and feel of JustGiving.com to fit personal preferences which you have told us about, which we have derived from Cookies (see our
                                <a href="/info/cookies">cookies policy</a>), which we have inferred from your service usage, or market research about your profile;</li>

                                    <li>providing non-personalised information to fundraisers to let them know about contributions made to their campaign - this helps fundraisers keep track 
                            of donations made to their campaigns and (where the donor is happy for us to share their details) allows them to pass on a message of thanks;</li>

                                    <li>publishing information on fundraising pages to allow donors (and potential donors) to see amounts pledged to each campaign and read 
                            messages of support - individual donors always have the option to use an anonymous label against donations / messages placed on campaign pages 
                            and this is something you are recommended to adopt if you are concerned about having information about your donation published on the internet;</li>

                                    <li>allowing charities, not-for-profits and JustGiving Projects who are registered with us to have visibility of donations made to them so they can:<br><br>

                            <ul>
                                <li>understand which fundraisers have established campaigns within JustGiving.com for their benefit and communicate with fundraisers in relation to that event or JustGiving Project;</li>

                                <li>provide fundraisers with more details about their organisation or JustGiving Project (but only if the fundraiser allows us to do this); </li>

                                <li>contact individual donors to pass on a thank you message and tell them more about their organisation or JustGiving Project (but only if the individual donor allows us to do this); and</li>

                                <li>track the total donations made through those campaigns (but not the names of individual donors unless the individual donor allows us to do this); </li>
                            </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>in relation to creators of JustGiving Project pages, undertaking an identity check and bank account verification with a credit reference agency; </li>

                                    <li>allowing companies to review their employees' participation in <a href="/en/companies">Company Fundraising</a> activities, where you have indicated that you agree to them doing so;</li>

                                    <li>providing direct marketing communications in the form of email alerts and bulletins to tell you about developments in the services available 
                            through our website, together with tips, news stories and competitions related to giving and fundraising for charities, not-for-profits and 
                            JustGiving Projects - we will only do this where you have indicated you would like to receive updates and you may change your preferences and
                             cease receiving direct marketing from us at any time by <a href="/account">updating your account</a>.  Where you have indicated that you would like to receive 
                                 direct marketing communications from us, we will use your contact details and personal preferences which you have told us about, which we 
                                 have derived from Cookies (see our <a href="/info/cookies">cookies policy</a>), which we have inferred from your service usage, or market research about your profile;</li>

                                    <li>providing service update emails regarding the JustGiving service and your specific account; and</li>

                                    <li>analysis to improve the service we offer - for example you may be asked to complete one of our online user satisfaction surveys.</li>

                                </ul>

                                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">We will only use the information for the purposes where we have your permission to do so in accordance with this Privacy Policy, as well as where it is required or authorised by law.</p>

                                <h2>Providing information to others</h2>
                                <p>We work closely with a number of trusted partners with whom we need to share personal information to help us operate the JustGiving service. These include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>our related entities around the world, as detailed in "Working with other service providers and group companies" below;</li>
                                    <li>banks and payment providers - to authorise and complete payment transactions; </li>
                                    <li>in relation to creators of JustGiving Project pages, third party credit reference agencies - for the purposes of identity check and bank account verification; and</li>
                                    <li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs or the Irish Revenue Commissioners â€“ but only if we need to authorise claims for Gift Aid or other forms of tax efficient ways of giving.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>We also:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>have third party service providers who process information on our behalf to help run some of our internal business operations including email distribution, 
                        IT services and customer services- see the paragraph "Working with other service providers and group companies"; and</li>
                                    <li>transfer information to charities, not-for-profits and JustGiving Projects in accordance with the paragraph above - "How we use personal information".</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    We will only share information with other organisations where we have your permission to do so in accordance with this Privacy Policy, 
                        or where we believe it is necessary for a legitimate reason connected with the service we offer.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We understand that many users like our service because they can make donations to a charity, not-for-profit or
                         JustGiving Project anonymously. We respect this and will never provide information to a charity, not-for-profit or 
                        JustGiving Project about your donation unless we have your permission to do so, which we generally obtain at the time of
                         collecting your personal information or where you change your preferences or your account.  If you do ask us to pass on 
                        your details to a charity, not-for-profit or JustGiving Project, you may receive further correspondence from them including 
                        emails telling you more about their cause.  Any further correspondence you receive from them will be governed by their privacy 
                        policies and you may ask them to stop communicating with you by contacting them in accordance with the terms of their privacy policy and the relevant laws.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Keeping information secure</h2>
                                <p>
                                    We invest significant resources in protecting the security and confidentiality of information collected through JustGiving.com, 
                        however, no internet-based site can be 100% secure. For more information see our <a href="/info/security">security policy</a>

                                    For operational reasons, we transfer personal information to service providers and our group companies who help us manage our systems. 
                        Some of these systems may be located in the UK, and other countries in the European Economic Area. Different privacy laws may apply in 
                        these countries and you agree that we may transfer personal information to these countries.  We only make these arrangements and transfer 
                        personal information to different countries where we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect the integrity 
                        and security of any information held and that the provider acts at all times in compliance with applicable privacy laws.
                                </p>
