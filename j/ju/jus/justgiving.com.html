                                We will use the details you provided when you set up your account to create your fundraising page or proposed JustGiving Crowdfunding page (“JG Crowdfunding Page”).

                                You must ensure that they are happy and have agreed to you providing us with their information.  Where required by local laws, we would advise you to keep a record of their agreement and provide them with a copy of, or link to, this Policy. This is especially the case if you provide us with sensitive information about them (e.g. a reference to an illness or health condition).
                                </p>

                                You should also only contact individuals via Justgiving.com who you know would be happy to hear from you and must not use our

                                If you create a JG Crowdfunding Page for a club, organisation, body or association which is managed by someone other than yourself, you must ensure that the manager(s) of that club, organisation etc. agrees to your fundraising (e.g. you are a member of a sports club and want to raise funds for a new clubhouse - you must seek the agreement of the sports club committee).
                                </p>

                                    <li>personalising the look and feel of JustGiving.com (as well as our communications with users) to fit personal preferences which you have told us about or which we have inferred from your usage of our website (such as donation history, and fundraising or charity page cares/likes, both on our website and, where you have given us permission, via social networks (see also the <a href="#Cookies">Cookies</a> and <a href="#Analytics">Analytics</a> sections for more information)) or derived from market research;</li>

                                    <li>providing users with fundraising related news stories, tips and competitions, updates on campaigns, fundraising or JG Crowdfunding Pages supported, comments on website content, details of similar or popular fundraising pages, campaigns, events or JG Crowdfunding pages and messages of support;</li>

For example if you and one of your Facebook friends have logged in through Facebook and are both using our site we might let your friend know that you are fundraising via our site. We will only do this where we have appropriate permissions or you have provided appropriate permissions to the social network as are required by privacy and data protection laws;</li>

                                    <li>to help us prevent fraud associated with online payments;</li>

We respect this and will not publicly display your name on donations you have made on our site unless we have your permission to do so.  However, the creator of a fundraising page you donate to will be provided with your name (but not your email address, unless you have provided your permission for us to do so).

                                If you allow us to pass on your details to a fundraiser, charity, not-for-profit or JG Crowdfunding Page creator, you may receive further correspondence from them including emails telling you more about their cause and to thank you for your donation. If you do not allow us to pass on your details to them for these purposes you will be anonymous to them (except for a fundraising page creator, as above) and they will not be able to contact you in this way.  Any further correspondence you receive from them will not be governed by this Policy; it will be governed by their privacy policies (if applicable) and you may ask them to stop communicating with you by contacting them in accordance with the terms of their privacy policy (if applicable) and the relevant laws.
                                </p>

                                For operational reasons, we transfer personal information to service providers and our group companies who help us manage our systems and processes (such as card payment providers), and to deliver our services to users.

                                These service providers and group companies may be located in the UK, other countries in the European Economic Area or elsewhere in the world (for example our fraud prevention provider in the United States and our subsidiary in Australia).  Different privacy laws may apply in these countries and you understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer of personal information to these countries, group companies and service providers.

                                We only make these arrangements or transfers where we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect any information held in that country or that the service provider acts at all times in compliance with applicable privacy laws. Where required under applicable laws we will take measures to ensure that personal information handled in other countries will receive at least the same level of protection as it is given in your home country.
                                </p>
