			<h1>JustGiving’s privacy policy</h1>
			<p>Your privacy is paramount. This is how serious we are about it: we will never pass on, trade, exchange or sell your personal details to <strong>anyone</strong> without your express consent. We really mean <em>anyone</em>: not a sister company, not a ‘friendly third party’, not even the charity you are giving to.</p>

<p>There is one exception to that rule: when you build a JustGiving page, we will pass on your name, email address and postal address to the charity you have chosen to support, so that they can thank you. You can opt in to receive further communications from them if you like, but you don’t have to.</p>


<p><strong>That’s it. If you want the full, extended version, here it is:</strong></p>  

<p>By visiting or registering with Justgiving.com, you are agreeing to the practices detailed in the Privacy Policy below so please read on to find out how information relating to you will be treated as you use our site.</p>

<ol>

  <li><strong>The information we collect from you as a site visitor</strong><br>
    JustGiving (JG) collects information about the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of all visitors to our site. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer automatically when you use the internet. This information is only collected in aggregate (in other words, we are not able to monitor your individual usage of the site) and helps us monitor site traffic patterns in order to improve our service. 
<br><br>
This site uses cookies for some interactive features. A cookie is a small amount of data, which includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers will automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser to reject cookies but some parts of the web site may not function properly if the cookies are rejected.
</li>

  <li><strong>The information we collect from you as a registered user with a JustGiving page</strong><br>
 When you create a secure personal account on JG for the purpose of creating a JustGiving page, we collect your title, name, email address, postal address, your phone number (where you agree to provide it) and your password. We will automatically pass on your name and email and home addresses to the charity that will benefit from the donations you are collecting. In all other instances, we will not pass on this information to any third party unless you give us your express consent.</li>

<li><strong>The information we collect from you when you donate</strong><br>
   If you donate or make a pledge on JG, we collect your first and last name, your declaration of tax status, your credit or debit card details (including card type, card number and expiry date) and your billing address. We only pass on your name to your friend (the owner of the fundraising page where you made your donation) through their secure JustGiving account. <p></p>
   <p>We will only use your payment details for the purpose of processing your donation via our card processing partner Barclaycard. To find out more about the security of your payments, please read our <a href="/info/security">Security policy</a>. If you make a Gift Aid declaration, we will pass it on to HM Revenue and Customs for the purpose of reclaiming tax on behalf of the recipient charity. Your Gift Aid declaration includes your name and home address (which may be different from your billing address) along with the confirmation that you are paying sufficient amounts of tax in the current tax year. Every time you make a donation, you will be given the option to receive further information from the charity: we will not pass on your name or addresses to them unless you expressly ask us to do so.
</p></li>

<li><strong>Email alerts and newsletters from JustGiving </strong><br>
    We may send you short emails from time to time: email alerts with important information about our service and newsletters with tips, stories and competitions. You will always be offered the ability to unsubscribe from our newsletters and from our fundraising tips, donation alerts and fundraising updates. If you have a personal JG account, you can change your contact preferences at any time by visiting the ‘Your details’ and ‘Change your email preferences’ sections.</li>

<li><strong>Charities’ use of your personal information </strong><br>
   Where you have opted in to pass on your personal details to a charity through our website, JG declines all responsibility for the subsequent use of your personal information by the charity. If you wish to stop receiving further communications from a charity, please contact them directly.
</li>

 <li><strong>Security precautions to protect your information</strong><br>
   The transfer of online transaction data to and from the web site is protected by the implementation of a Secure Sockets Layer protocol. Our VeriSign 128-bit secure certificate allows web browsers to verify the authenticity of our secure.justgiving.com domain and to communicate with our site securely, protecting confidential information from interception and hacking. It is your responsibility to keep your password secure at all times to avoid unauthorised use of your JG account.</li>


 <li><strong>Tell a friend and charity voucher services</strong><br>
   When you provide a friend’s email address for JG to forward a web address, we guarantee that we will only use your friend’s address for this purpose. We will not send them further emails unless they opt in to receive regular information from us.</li>

 <li><strong>Legal process</strong><br>
   Although unlikely, JG may be forced by law to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate authorities.</li>
 
  <li><strong>Acceptance of our Privacy Policy</strong><br>
  Use of the JG website and associated services implies acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you are not satisfied with any aspect of it please do not continue to use the website and services. This policy may change from time to time and you are deemed to have accepted the current version each time you use Justgiving.com or any site powered by us.</li></ol>
