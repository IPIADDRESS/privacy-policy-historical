You can also choose to provide your name, addresses and phone number. If you ask a question to our expert then you will also need to provide your credit card number, and, in the case of issuance of direct debit authorizations, your bank account information (unless you wish to make payments via PayPal).</p>
<p>If you wish to register with JustAnswer as an expert, we need specific personal data in order to make it possible. This includes your e-mail address, names, addresses, telephone numbers, documentation of performance, professional licenses, and certifications.</p>
<p>Additional personal data might also be necessary, depending on the services that JustAnswer offers and which you wish to utilize.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information that we collect automatically</span></p>
<p>When you visit our Websites, we may collect certain information automatically from your device, such as your IP address or mobile advertising identifier, your browser type, the date and time of your visit and the pages you access.&nbsp; In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, this information may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information that we obtain from third party sources</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Providing information about others</span></p>
<p>If you wish to provide the personal data of third parties (for example, the e-mail address of friends or possible experts) to JustAnswer, make sure in advance that the relevant person has been made aware of the disclosure of their personal data to JustAnswer for the purposes for which you will provide it, and that you have obtained any consents that may be necessary under applicable laws. Note that you can be liable to the relevant person, as well as JustAnswer, if you have not obtained the person's consent where required.</p>
<ol start="2"><li><strong> <a name="use" id="use"></a>Use of personal data</strong></li>

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you or may otherwise need the personal data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal data).&nbsp;</p>

</ul><ol start="4"><li><strong> <a name="transfers" id="transfers"></a>International data transfers</strong></li>
</ol><p>Our Website servers are currently located in the USA and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. Please note that the data protection law in the US does not currently offer the same protection against use and transmission of personal data as is the case under the law of the European Union. &nbsp;By using our service, you consent to the transfer of your personal data outside of the European Economic Area.</p>
<ol start="5"><li><strong> <a name="retention" id="retention"></a>Data retention</strong></li>
</ol><p>We retain personal data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<ol start="6"><li><strong> <a name="rights" id="rights"></a>Your rights</strong></li>
</ol><p>You have the following data protection rights, which you can request using the <a href="#contact">contact</a> details below:</p>
<ul><li>If you wish to <strong>access, correct, update or request deletion</strong> of your personal data. Note that you can modify and correct some of your personal data at any time by opening your account via the Websites and changing your profile information that is posted there.</li>

You can also exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you.&nbsp; To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us.</li>
<li>If we have collected and process your personal data with your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
</ul><p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws and you have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal data.&nbsp; For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</p>
<ol start="7"><li><strong> <a name="links" id="links"></a>Use of links to and from external providers</strong></li>
</ol><p>Note that the Websites contain links to external third parties (advertising banners, for example) and that links can be named in Contributions.

<ol start="8"><li><strong> <a name="security" id="security"></a>Security</strong></li>
</ol><p>The Websites use a number of technical and organisational security precautions in order to protect the Websites and you against unauthorized third-party access to your data:</p>
<ul><li>JustAnswer uses a 128-bit secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology and digital certification for monetary payments via credit cards and the confirmation thereof.</li>
<li>The JustAnswer database records important changes, such that unauthorized payment flows can be cancelled quickly.</li>
<li>The main servers of JustAnswer are located with a leading Internet Access Provider with the highest level of security precautions, including biometric recognition and 24/7 monitoring of the employees. In addition, JustAnswer has a backup server system, in which, however, no e-mail addresses, credit card information, or passwords are stored.</li>
</ul><p>In spite of the high security precautions, however, the possibility cannot be ruled out that unauthorized third parties might gain access to personal data without permission.</p>
<ol start="9"><li><strong> <a name="updates" id="updates"></a>Updates to this Privacy Notice</strong></li>
</ol><p>We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments.
