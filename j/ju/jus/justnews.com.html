certain services on-line, from users who agree to participate in on-line
surveys, from users who wish to make certain on-line information requests from
us and from users who wish to participate in on-line contests and promotions
sponsored by us. Because participation in these activities is completely
voluntary, the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
The type of information so requested or collected by us includes user contact
information (like their name and email address) and user demographic information
(like gender or age). Contact information will be used to notify contest winners
and award prizes and, in some instances may be shared with the contest or survey
sponsor. Anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of reporting
survey results and monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this

personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. The visitor's
contact information will be used to contact the visitor when the visitor has
expressed interest in being contacted (visitors can opt-out of receiving future
mailings by complying with the choice/output requirements noted below). The user
demographic information so collected will be used by us to tailor our visitor's
experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be
interested in, and displaying content according to their preferences. If a user
elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site or to
send an e-card through our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email

</script>We also may use cookies to allow third parties to better serve advertisements to you outside of this website on websites operated by Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc. and other websites. 

User demographic information is
shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis in a manner which will not
personally identify the individual submitting such information. We may also
share personally identifiable user information with governmental authorities
when legally required to do so, and to cooperate with such authorities
investigating claims of illegal activity such as (but not limited to) illegal
transfer of copyrighted material, or user website postings or email messages
that contain threats of violence. We may also disclose personally identifiable
information in other cases where we have reason to believe that disclosure is
necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use. Other than these specific
exceptions noted, we do not sell, rent or provide access to any data collected
about or from our users.</p>
<p><b>Third Party Advertising</b><br>
The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web
advertising partner. Information about your visits to this site, such as number
of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal
in-formation), is used to serve ads to you. For more information about
DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">click here.</a>
</p>
<p><b>Third Party Cookies</b><br>
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">click here</a>. </p>
<p><b>Linking and Framing</b><br>
This site contains links to other sites. This site is not responsible for the
privacy practices or the content of such websites. Occasionally when linking to
another site, you may still see our site's logo or frame. This is to provide you
with a seamless experience when visiting our website. In these cases you are no
longer on JustNews.com and are now on a
different website whose information collection practices may differ from ours.
The privacy policy of the site you are on will govern how information collected
from you is used.</p>
<p><b>Public Forums</b><br>
This site at some or all times makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or
news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is
disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise
caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. IBS cannot accept
any responsibility for ensuring the privacy of information that you choose to
disclose in these areas.</p>
<p><b>Security</b><br>
This site has reasonable security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse
and alteration of the information under our control. Please remember that no
computer system should be considered safe from intrusion. Email may pass through
many computer systems, and should not be considered as a secure means of
communication unless encrypted. Even then, information is only as secure as the
encryption method. Employees are made aware of security policies and changes via
email reminders monthly. Access is limited to a very small number of employees
with a defined need and is password protected. In order to provide the best
possible security we review our Web security policies every 180 days.</p>
<p><b>Children and Privacy</b><br>
This site is generally not targeted to children. If we learn that we have
received personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13,
we will take steps to delete such information or to obtain verifiable parental
consent.</p>
<p><b>Supplemental Information</b><br>
This site may supplement the information that you provide with information that
is received from third parties. This information may be received from our
partners in sponsored content sections. The type of information that is shared
could include user contact information (like name and email address) and user
demographic information (like zip code, age or income level). This site will use
such information in accordance with this privacy policy. However, when you leave
the JustNews.com website the privacy
statement of the other site will apply to use of information by that site. (See
"Linking and Framing" above).</p>
<p><b>Choice/Opt-Out</b><br>
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications
from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the
visitor. You will notice in all free email subscriptions generated from this
website there is an unsubscribe link at the bottom of the message. Simply click
on this link to go to a page that allows you to unsubscribe from any or all of
the lists you are subscribed to.
</p><p></p>In addition to using the unsubscribe page, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:security@ibsys.com">security@ibsys.com</a>.<p></p>
<p><b>Correct/Update</b><br>
If you desire to change or modify information previously provided you may either
email <a href="mailto:security@ibsys.com">security@ibsys.com</a> or send a
letter to the Security Administrator at the address below.</p>
<p><b>Contacting the Website</b><br>

site, or your dealings with this website, you can contact:</p>

<p><b>Changes to This Policy</b><br>
We may make changes to this policy from time to time. We will post changes to
this policy here, so be sure to check back periodically. We will generally use
information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information
was collected. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable
information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we
will notify our users via email or by posting a notice on the site for 30 days.
