<h2 id="terms_and_conditions_of_use_and_sale">I. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE AND SALE</h2>
<br>

<h3>1. INTRODUCTION AND OUR ROLE</h3>

<p>
    1.1. <strong>Company details:</strong> JUST EAT is a company registered in Ontario, Canada with registered company number 002206170,
     whose registered office is at Main Floor, 379 Adelaide Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5V 1S5.
</p>
<p>
    1.2. <strong>Service:</strong> We provide a way for you to communicate your orders (<strong>"Orders"</strong>) for products (<strong>"Products"</strong>) 
    to delivery or takeaway restaurants (<strong>"Restaurants"</strong>) displayed on the Website (the <strong>"Service"</strong>). 
    Please see paragraph 11 for important information regarding the legal relationship between you, JUST EAT and the Restaurants.
</p>
<br>

<h3>2. WEBSITE ACCESS AND TERMS</h3>

<p>
    2.1. <strong>Website access:</strong> You may access some areas of the Website without making an Order or registering your details with us. 
    Most areas of the Website are open to everyone.
</p>
<p>
    2.2. <strong>Acceptance of terms:</strong> By accessing any part of the Website, you indicate that you accept these Website Terms. 
    If you do not accept these Website Terms, you should leave the Website immediately, and you will not be able to order any Products through the Website.
</p>
<p>
    2.3. <strong>Revision of terms:</strong> We may revise these Website Terms at any time. You should check the Website regularly
    to review the current Website Terms, because they are binding on you. You will be subject to the policies 
    and terms and conditions in force at the time that you place an Order through us.
</p>
<p>
    2.4. <strong>Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Website.
    You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Website through your Internet connection are
    aware of these Website Terms and that they comply with them.
</p>
<br>

<h3>3. YOUR STATUS</h3>

<p>
    3.1. <strong>Capacity and age:</strong> By placing an Order through the Website, you warrant that:
</p>
<p>
    3.1.1. You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; and 
</p>
<p>
    3.1.2. You are at least 18 years old.
</p>
<br>

<h3>4. HOW TO MAKE AN ORDER AND HOW IT IS PROCESSED</h3>

<p>
    4.1. <strong>Compiling your Order:</strong> Once you have selected the Products you wish to order from the menu of your chosen 
    Restaurant and provided the other required information, you will be given the opportunity to submit your Order 
    by clicking or selecting the "proceed", "place my order" or similar button. It is important that you check all 
    the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking or selecting this button; once you do so 
    we will start processing your Order and errors cannot be corrected.
</p>
<p>
    4.2. <strong>Amending or cancelling your Order:</strong> Once you have submitted your Order and your payment has been authorised, 
    you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order, nor will you be entitled to a refund (please refer to 
    paragraph 4.4 for details of the process relating to rejected Orders).  If you wish to change or cancel your Order,
    you should contact the Restaurant or, if you are unable to reach the Restaurant, our Customer Care team as 
    described in paragraph 6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests.  
    However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your 
    requests as they may have already started processing your Order.
</p>
<p>
    4.3. <strong>Payment authorisation:</strong> Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Order will not be processed or 
    communicated to the relevant Restaurant.
</p>
<p>
    4.4. <strong>Processing your Order and Restaurant rejections:</strong> On receipt of your Order, we will begin processing it by sending 
    it to the relevant Restaurant and will notify you by email that your Order has been received and is being processed.   
    Please note that any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any Order confirmation e-mail that you may 
    receive each merely indicate that your Order has been received and is being processed by us, and does not necessarily 
    mean that your Order has been accepted by the Restaurant.   We encourage all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and 
    to communicate any rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable 
    if a Restaurant rejects your Order.  However, Restaurants have the discretion to reject Orders at any time because 
    they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason.
</p>
<p>
    4.5. <strong>Delivery of your Order:</strong>  Estimated times for deliveries and pick-ups are provided by the Restaurants and are only estimates.   
    Neither we nor the Restaurants guarantee that Orders will be delivered or will be available for pick-up within the estimated times.
</p>
<br>

<h3>5. PRICE AND PAYMENT</h3>

<p>
    5.1. <strong>Sales tax, delivery and online payment costs:</strong> Prices will be as quoted on the Website. These prices will have 
    applicable sales taxes applied at checkout, but may exclude delivery costs (if you opt for delivery instead of pick-up)
     and any online payment administration charges (if you pay for your Order online).  These will be added to the total amount due where applicable.
</p>
<p>
    5.2. <strong>Incorrect pricing:</strong> This Website contains a large number of menus and it is possible that some of the menus may include incorrect prices. 
    If the correct price for an Order is higher than the price stated on the Website, we will normally contact you before the relevant Order is 
    dispatched.   In such an event, neither we nor the relevant Restaurant is under any obligation to ensure that the Order is provided to you 
    at the incorrect lower price or to compensate you in respect of incorrect pricing.
</p>
<p>
    5.3. <strong>Payment methods:</strong> Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted credit or debit card through the Website or in cash to the 
    Restaurant at the point of delivery to you.
</p>
<p>
    5.4. <strong>Card payments:</strong> If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be required to show the card to the 
    Restaurant at the time of delivery as proof of identification and so that they can check that the 
    card conforms with the receipt data for the Order.   Please note that from time to time there may be 
    delays with the processing of card payments and transactions; this may result in payments taking up to 
    sixty (60) days to be deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit or debit card.
</p>
<p>
    5.5. <strong>Credit and discount vouchers:</strong> A credit or discount may apply to your Order if you use a promotional 
    voucher or code recognised by the Website and endorsed by JUST EAT, and you pay for any balance by credit 
    or debit card.  Please refer to our <a href="#voucher_terms_and_conditions">Voucher Terms &amp; Conditions</a> for the full terms and 
    conditions applicable to the use of credit and discount vouchers.  Please note that because of standard 
    banking procedures, your bank or card issuer will initially "ring-fence" the full amount of the Order 
    (before any credit or discount) in your account for a period of typically up to 5 working days (and in some 
    cases up to 30 days, depending on your bank or card issuer), and this amount will therefore be unavailable 
    in your account for that period.  The credit or discount will be applied at the time your bank or card issuer
    transfers the funds for your Order to us, at which point the credit or discounted amount will not be transferred 
    to us and will instead be released by your bank or card issuer back into your available balance.   
    You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in
    relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.
</p>
<p>
    5.6. <strong>Rejected Orders:</strong>  Because of standard banking procedures, once you have submitted an Order that you are 
    paying for by credit or debit card and your payment has been authorised, your bank or card issuer will "ring-fence" 
    the full amount of your Order.  If your Order is subsequently rejected by the Restaurant (as described in paragraph 4.4 above)
    or cancelled for any other reason, your bank or card issuer will not transfer the funds for the Order to us, 
    and will instead release the relevant amount back into your available balance.  However, this may take a period of 
    typically up to 5 working days (and in some cases up to 30 days, depending on your bank or card issuer).  
    You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation 
    to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.
</p>
<br>

<h3>6. CUSTOMER CARE</h3>

<p>
    6.1. <strong>General:</strong> If you are having any problems with your Order, we recommend that you try to contact the 
    Restaurant directly in the first instance to discuss the issue.  Our experience indicates that this is 
    likely to be the most efficient way of resolving the problem.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
    customer care is extremely important to us.  Accordingly, as described further in this paragraph 6 
    and subject to paragraphs 6.5 and 11, our Customer Care team will therefore try to assist you where 
    possible (subject to resource availability) if you have any problems contacting or resolving your issue 
    directly with the Restaurant.  You can contact our Customer Care team by clicking or selecting the <a onclick="window.open(this.href,'Support','width=600,height=600');return false;" target="_blank" href="http://v2.zopim.com/widget/livechat.html?key=2nocZmlPwLMbUEhvFgVGS2jKA8w6sJAw&amp;lang=en">"Need help?"</a>, "Help" or similar button or by calling the telephone number shown on the Website.
</p>
<p>
    6.2. <strong>Questions about your Order:</strong>  If your Order is taking longer than expected or you have any other problems with your Order that you are unable to resolve directly with the Restaurant, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above and one of our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to follow up on your query.
</p>
<p>
    6.3. <strong>Changing or cancelling your Order:</strong> If you wish to change or cancel your Order after it has been submitted and payment has been authorised, and you are unable to reach the Restaurant, you may contact our Customer Care team as described above and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests.  However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started processing your Order.
</p>
<p>
    6.4. <strong>Complaints or feedback:</strong>  In the event that you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant, please consider providing feedback in the form of ratings, comments and reviews on the Website (together, "Reviews") to reflect your experience.  The Reviews are an important part of our quality control process.

<h3>5. SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION</h3>

<p>5.1. We take technical, administrative and physical security steps designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorised access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.  We have implemented procedures designed to limit the dissemination of your Personal Information to only personnel with a business "need-to-know" or whose duties reasonably require such information.</p>
<p>5.2. We will keep your information as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which that Personal Information was collected, and as permitted or as required by law.  We may retain certain data as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-Personal Information, or account recovery, or if required by law. All retained Personal Information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you request that your name be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all your Personal Information due to technological and legal constraints.</p>
<p>5.3. Where you have chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your password with anyone.  Unless we negligently disclose your password to a third party, we will not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into using your name and password.</p>
<p>5.4. The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will take steps to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information or other data transmitted to the Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your Personal Information, we will use organizational and technical safeguards  to try to prevent unauthorised access.  Please also note that the Website contains links to third party websites, which are not governed by this Privacy Policy, and JUST EAT is not responsible for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information by such third party websites.</p>

Upon receipt of your written request, we will provide you with a copy of your Personal Information although in certain limited circumstances, we may not be able to make all relevant information available to you such as where that information also pertains to another user.  In such circumstances we will provide reasons for the denial to you upon request.  We will endeavour to deal with all requests for access and modifications in a timely manner. We will advise you in writing if we cannot meet your requests within this time limit.</p>
<p>6.2. If you wish to do this, please contact us using the contact details set out in paragraph 8 below. We will charge you a fee to meet our administrative costs in providing this information to you.</p>
<p>6.3. Please note that we may request that you provide sufficient identification before we provide you with the Personal Information that we hold.  Any such identifying information shall be used only for this purpose.</p>

<h2 id="voucher_terms_and_conditions">III. JUST EAT VOUCHER TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</h2>
<br>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General</span></p>

<p>1. The following general terms and conditions (the <strong>"General Voucher Terms"</strong>) will apply to all vouchers issued by JUST EAT from time to time for use on the Website, including vouchers with a credit value (<strong>"Paycode Vouchers"</strong>) and promotional discount vouchers (<strong>"Discount Vouchers"</strong>, and together with Paycode Vouchers, (<strong>"Vouchers"</strong>)).</p>
<p>2. Individual Vouchers will also be subject to, and the General Voucher Terms will be supplemented and/or modified by, additional terms and conditions (the <strong>"Specific Voucher Terms"</strong>) that will be specified on the Voucher or at the time the Voucher is issued.</p>
<p>3. Vouchers may only be redeemed towards online Orders from Restaurants made through the Website.</p>
<br>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Terms of Use for Paycode Vouchers</span></p>

<p>4. Paycode Vouchers must be applied to a registered JUST EAT online customer account via <a href="http://www.just-eat.ca">www.just-eat.ca</a> by no later than the deadline specified on the Paycode Voucher and/or at the time the Paycode Voucher is issued by entering the relevant voucher code (<strong>"Paycode Voucher Code"</strong>), and will expire if not applied by this date.  If the Paycode Voucher is applied before the expiry date, the customer account will be credited by the relevant amount.  Unless otherwise provided or specified in the Specific Voucher Terms, any credit must be used within six (6) months of the date on which the Paycode Voucher is issued.</p>
<p>5. If the order value is less than the Paycode Voucher value that has been credited to the customer account, no change or cash will be given.  However, any balance will be left as a credit in the customer account, and may be redeemed against subsequent orders.</p>
<p>6. If the order value is more than the Paycode Voucher value that has been credited to the customer account, the remaining balance must be paid online using a credit card.</p>
<p>7. Paycode Vouchers and Paycode Voucher Codes are only valid for one use.  Once the Paycode Voucher Code has been used (whether in an authorised or unauthorised manner), the Paycode Voucher Code will be void.  Paycode Voucher recipients are responsible for ensuring that their Paycode Voucher Codes are not used by someone else.</p>
<br>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Terms of Use for Discount Vouchers</span></p>

<p>8. Discount Vouchers must be used by the deadline specified on the Discount Voucher and/or at the time the Discount Voucher is issued by entering the relevant voucher code (<strong>"Discount Voucher Code"</strong>), and will expire after such date.</p>
<p>9. In the event of 2,000 redemptions made per Discount Voucher Code, the Discount Voucher Code will automatically expire regardless of the expiry date.</p>
<br>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Terms of Use for All Vouchers</span></p>

<p>10. The right to use a Voucher is personal to the original recipient and may not be transferred.  No Voucher may be copied, reproduced, distributed, or published directly or indirectly in any form or by any means for use by an entity other than the original recipient, or stored in a data retrieval system, without our prior written permission.   In particular, Vouchers distributed or circulated without our written approval, for example on an Internet message board or on a "bargains" website, are not valid for use and may be refused or cancelled.</p>
<p>11. Unless otherwise provided or specified in the Specific Voucher Terms:</p>
<p>9.1 Vouchers may not be used in conjunction with other Vouchers or any other discounts or promotions provided or advertised from time to time;</p>
<p>9.2 each Voucher will be valid for use by a recipient only once;</p>
<p>9.3 each customer or household is limited to one Voucher per promotion or offer; and</p>
<p>9.4 the right to use a Voucher is personal to the original recipient and may not be transferred.</p>
<p>12. When you use a Voucher you warrant to us that you are the duly authorised recipient of the Voucher and that you are using it in accordance with these terms, lawfully, legally and in good faith.  If we believe in our sole discretion that a Voucher is being used in breach of these terms, unlawfully, illegally or in bad faith, we may reject or cancel the Voucher.</p>
<br>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Miscellaneous</span></p>

<p>13. Please note that because of standard banking procedures, your bank or card issuer will initially "ring-fence" the full amount of the Order (before any credit or discount) in your account for a period of typically up to 5 working days (and in some cases up to 30 days, depending on your bank or card issuer), and this amount will therefore be unavailable in your account for that period.  The credit or discount will be applied at the time your bank or card issuer transfers the funds for your order to us, at which point the credit or discounted amount will not be transferred to us and will instead be released by your bank or card issuer back into your available balance.</p>
<p>14. Vouchers may not be exchanged for cash.</p>
<p>15. We shall not be liable to any customer or household for any loss or claim arising out of the refusal, rejection, cancellation or withdrawal of any Voucher or any failure or inability of a customer or household to use a Voucher for any reason.</p>
<p>16. We reserve the right, at any time and in its sole discretion, to add to or amend these terms and conditions in relation to the use of Vouchers or to vary or terminate the operation of a Voucher at any time without notice.</p>
<p>17. All standard terms and conditions from time to time for use of the Website and the Service apply.</p>
<br>

<p>5. We reserve the right to redraw a competition winner if the relevant prize is not accepted or claimed within the time period stated in the applicable Specific Competition Terms.</p>
<p>6. Completing and submitting a competition entry form will be deemed acceptance of the General Competition Terms and any applicable Specific Competition Terms.</p>
<p>7. The General Competition Terms and any applicable Specific Competition Terms shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ontario.</p>
<p>8. Any personal data that is collected as part of any JUST EAT competition will be processed in accordance with applicable Canadian privacy legislation. For further information on our Privacy Policy please go to: <a href="http://www.just-eat.ca/privacy-policy">http://www.just-eat.ca/privacy-policy</a>.</p>
