<h2>Tennman Digital Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Tennman Digital LLC and its affiliated companies (collectively, “Tennman Digital”)
has created this privacy statement (“Privacy Policy”) to explain and summarize how we
collect, use and protect, or in some cases do not protect, your personal information
as you interact with us online through the website (the “Website”). Tennman Digital
reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new privacy
statement at this location. Therefore, you are responsible for periodically checking
the Privacy Policy for changes. Your use of the Website is governed at all times by
the Tennman Digital Terms of Service. If you are visiting from outside the United
States there may be special rules or limitations on your use of this Website.</p>

<h3>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

<p>Tennman Digital collects and uses information you provide to us or that we learn
from your use of this Website. Tennman Digital does not share your personal
information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We may share
your personal information where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction
or do something that you have asked us to do. Whenever we may need to share your
personal information, we try to provide you with the information you need to make
informed choices.</p>

<p>Tennman Digital collects and uses personal information from you in several ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>User Accounts</strong>  In order to access certain areas of the Website or certain
Services, you may be required to create a user account and provide certain
personal information such as your name, your email address, your birth date,
your user ID, your password, and other personal information. If you would like
to subscribe to additional Services, you may be required to provide additional
information such as your telephone number, your mobile service provider, and
your address.  We may use the information you provide in online registration forms
to notify you periodically about important changes to the Website or the Services
(such as a change to this Privacy Policy or notice of a security breach), new
products and services, and special offers and contests that may be of interest
to you. Regardless of any other provision of this Privacy Policy, we may
permanently store any personal information provided by you via such registration
process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>For contests conducted on the Website</strong>, we use the personal information you provide
only for the purpose of contacting you if you win a prize and sending the prize to you.
We do not use the contact information contained in contest entries to create mailing
lists or for any other purpose, unless you have simultaneously subscribed to a mailing
list or consented to such other use.  For further information about how we handle
entries to a particular contest, please consult the contest rules.  All contests
held on this site are limited to persons above a certain age.  Accordingly,
we will ask each contestant to provide year of birth, as well as name, address,
and email address.  Please refer to the specific age requirements for each contest
as rules may vary from contest to contest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Where you provide optional information</strong>, such as information about your interests
and hobbies, Tennman Digital uses this information on an aggregate basis to enable
us to better understand our users, develop new products, and improve our products
and services. Tennman Digital may also use this information to update you about
new promotions, albums, or products, or to send you newsletters and other
communications and materials relating to Tennman Digital, the Website, or the
Services. This direct marketing will only come from Tennman Digital —
we will not allow affiliates to do any direct marketing. Where practical,
Tennman Digital limits the access of our business partners and service
providers who assist with technical support and customer service through the use
of confidentiality provisions and agreements that are intended to enforce
this Privacy Policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Website Usage</strong> Tennman Digital, or Tennman Digital business partners or
authorized service providers, may observe your activities, preferences, and
transactional data (such as your IP address and browser type) relating to your
use of this Website. While we may collect or log this information, we generally
do not identify you or match this information with your other personal
information. We may use this collected or logged information to diagnose
website technical problems, to facilitate your use of the site, or to track
aggregate traffic patterns throughout the Website.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Online Transactions</strong> If we offer you the opportunity to purchase products online
and you choose to purchase such products, you may be asked to share personal
information in addition to the information provided to create a user account,
such as credit card information, in order to complete a transaction. In addition,
you may be asked for information needed to complete your order, contact you to
confirm the order, and provide related customer service. This information is used,
for example, to effect your transactions, to create and share aggregate reports
about these transactions, and to perform credit fraud screening services for
transactions between you and Tennman Digital and/or our authorized service
providers. We may also use your information as permitted by law to perform
credit checks, or to report or collect debts owed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recruitment and Job Applications</strong> You may provide us with personal information,
such as that contained on a resume or a curriculum vitae, in connection with a
job application or inquiry. We may use this information throughout Tennman Digital
for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry. We may keep your
information on file for a reasonable period of time for future consideration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong> A cookie is a piece of data stored on Your computer
tied to Your information.  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.

However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given

disclosed in public forums, such as bulletin boards, news groups, communication

in such areas. Please remember that any information or other Content that is
