Therefore, you are responsible for periodically checking the Privacy Policy for changes. Your use of the Website is governed at all times by the Tennman Digital Terms of Service. If you are visiting from outside the United States there may be special rules or limitations on your use of this Website.</p>

<p><strong>For contests conducted on the Website</strong>, we use the personal information you provide only for the purpose of contacting you if you win a prize and sending the prize to you. We do not use the contact information contained in contest entries to create mailing lists or for any other purpose, unless you have simultaneously subscribed to a mailing list or consented to such other use. For further information about how we handle entries to a particular contest, please consult the contest rules. All contests held on this site are limited to persons above a certain age. Accordingly, we will ask each contestant to provide year of birth, as well as name, address, and email address.
