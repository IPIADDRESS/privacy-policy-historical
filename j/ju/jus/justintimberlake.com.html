    <h2>Tennman Digital Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      Tennman Digital LLC and its affiliated companies (collectively, “Tennman Digital”) has created this privacy statement (“Privacy Policy”) to explain and summarize how we collect, use and protect, or in some cases do not protect, your personal information as you interact with us online through the website (the “Website”). Tennman Digital reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new privacy statement at this location. Therefore, you are responsible for periodically checking the Privacy Policy for changes. Your use of the Website is governed at all times by the Tennman Digital Terms of Service. If you are visiting from outside the United States there may be special rules or limitations on your use of this Website.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>
          1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
        </h3>
        <p>
          Tennman Digital collects and uses information you provide to us or that we learn from your use of this Website. Tennman Digital does not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We may share your personal information where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something that you have asked us to do. Whenever we may need to share your personal information, we try to provide you with the information you need to make informed choices.

          Tennman Digital collects and uses personal information from you in several ways:

          User Accounts.  In order to access certain areas of the Website or certain Services, you may be required to create a user account and provide certain personal information such as your name, your email address, your birth date, your user ID, your password, and other personal information. If you would like to subscribe to additional Services, you may be required to provide additional information such as your telephone number, your mobile service provider, and your address.  We may use the information you provide in online registration forms to notify you periodically about important changes to the Website or the Services (such as a change to this Privacy Policy or notice of a security breach), new products and services, and special offers and contests that may be of interest to you. Regardless of any other provision of this Privacy Policy, we may permanently store any personal information provided by you via such registration process.

          For contests conducted on the Website, we use the personal information you provide only for the purpose of contacting you if you win a prize and sending the prize to you.  We do not use the contact information contained in contest entries to create mailing lists or for any other purpose, unless you have simultaneously subscribed to a mailing list or consented to such other use.  For further information about how we handle entries to a particular contest, please consult the contest rules.  All contests held on this site are limited to persons above a certain age.  Accordingly, we will ask each contestant to provide year of birth, as well as name, address, and email address.  Please refer to the specific age requirements for each contest as rules may vary from contest to contest.

          Where you provide optional information, such as information about your interests and hobbies, Tennman Digital uses this information on an aggregate basis to enable us to better understand our users, develop new products, and improve our products and services. Tennman Digital may also use this information to update you about new promotions, albums, or products, or to send you newsletters and other communications and materials relating to Tennman Digital, the Website, or the Services. This direct marketing will only come from Tennman Digital — we will not allow affiliates to do any direct marketing. Where practical, Tennman Digital limits the access of our business partners and service providers who assist with technical support and customer service through the use of confidentiality provisions and agreements that are intended to enforce this Privacy Policy.

          Website Usage. Tennman Digital, or Tennman Digital business partners or authorized service providers, may observe your activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your IP address and browser type) relating to your use of this Website. While we may collect or log this information, we generally do not identify you or match this information with your other personal information. We may use this collected or logged information to diagnose website technical problems, to facilitate your use of the site, or to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout the Website.

          Online Transactions. If we offer you the opportunity to purchase products online and you choose to purchase such products, you may be asked to share personal information in addition to the information provided to create a user account, such as credit card information, in order to complete a transaction. In addition, you may be asked for information needed to complete your order, contact you to confirm the order, and provide related customer service. This information is used, for example, to effect your transactions, to create and share aggregate reports about these transactions, and to perform credit fraud screening services for transactions between you and Tennman Digital and/or our authorized service providers. We may also use your information as permitted by law to perform credit checks, or to report or collect debts owed.

          Recruitment and Job Applications. You may provide us with personal information, such as that contained on a resume or a curriculum vitae, in connection with a job application or inquiry. We may use this information throughout Tennman Digital for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry. We may keep your information on file for a reasonable period of time for future consideration.

          Cookies and Web Beacons. A cookie is a piece of data stored on Your computer tied to Your information.  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  For the session ID cookie, once You close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.  A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on Your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.  We use cookies to store information about Your user account.  By setting a cookie on the Website, You would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the Website.  If You reject the cookie, You may still use the Website.  The only drawback to this is that You may be limited in some areas of the Website.  Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on the Website.  Some of our business partners use cookies on the Website (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.  We also use “web beacons” (also known as “1x1 gifs”) to monitor your activities around the Website.

          Public and Shared Areas. Any information and other Content (as defined in the Tennman Digital Terms of Service) disclosed in public areas of the Website will become public information. We cannot control the use of information or other Content disclosed in public forums, such as bulletin boards, news groups, communication facilities and chat rooms. You should exercise caution when disclosing information in these public areas and should refrain from disclosing your personal information in such areas. Please remember that any information or other Content that is disclosed in these areas, including your name, becomes available to others and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. TENNMAN DIGITAL WILL TREAT ANY MESSAGE BOARD POSTINGS, FEEDBACK, EMAILS OR SUGGESTIONS YOU PROVIDE TO US AS NON-CONFIDENTIAL AND NON-PROPRIETARY. IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE YOUR REAL NAME, YOUR NAME WILL BE AVAILABLE TO AND VIEWABLE BY ANYONE USING THE WORLD WIDE WEB AND/OR USING A SEARCH ENGINE.
