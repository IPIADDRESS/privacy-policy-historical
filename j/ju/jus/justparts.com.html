                                As part of our effort to make JustParts a positive and safe buying and selling environment,
                                your User ID (which serves as a footprint of sorts), is displayed throughout JustParts.com
                                and in so doing, is available to the public. As a result, all of your activity on
                                our website is traceable to your User ID. Notices will be sent to members to inform
                                of possible suspicious and/or illegal activity, and website policy violations. A
                                rating and commentary system attached to User IDs will also be used to provide information
                                to other users about the reliability of those users buying and/or selling goods
                                through our site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These notices will
                                refer to User IDs and items for specificity. Therefore, if you choose to associate
                                your User ID with your name and/or business name, the people you have revealed your
                                identity to will be able to personally identify your activities on JustParts.com.
