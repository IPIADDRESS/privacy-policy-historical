<p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this Policy.</p>
<p>This privacy policy (<strong>“Policy”</strong>) applies when we are acting as a data controller with respect to the personal data of our users. This Policy describes how we collect, use and share personal data of consumer users across our websites, including <a href="https://www.crowdfireapp.com" target="_blank">www.crowdfireapp.com</a> (the <strong>“Website”</strong>), Crowdfire’s mobile application (the <strong>“App”</strong>) and services offered to users (collectively with the Website and the App, the <strong>“Services”</strong>), and from our partners and other third parties. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your personal data as described in this Policy.</p>
<p>Please read this Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Policy. Our Services also incorporate privacy controls which affect how we will process your personal data. Please refer to Section ‎5 for a list of rights with regard to your personal data and how to exercise them.</p>
<p>This Policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of the Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Policy periodically for updates.</p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It</strong></p>
<p>There are three general categories of information we collect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information You Give to Us.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>We collect your account data, which may include your name, email address (<strong>“Account Data”</strong>). The Account Data may be processed for the purposes of providing to you our Services and of ensuring their security, maintaining back-ups of our databases and communicating with you. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us and to allow us to comply with our legal obligations. Without it, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested Services. </li>
    <li>We process information that you post for publication through our Services (<strong>“Publication Data”</strong>), including the content that you share to your social profiles. The Publication Data is processed for the purposes of enabling such publication and administering our Services. The legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract between you and us and/or taking steps, at your request, to enter into such a contract. Without it, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested Services.</li>
    <li>We process financial information such as credit card or PayPal information when you order Services in order to facilitate the processing of payments (<strong>“Payment Information”</strong>). The legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract between you and us and/or taking steps, at your request, to enter into such a contract and our legitimate interests, namely our interest in the proper administration of our website and business.</li>
    <li>We may process information contained in or relating to any communication that you send to us (<strong>“Correspondence Data”</strong>). The Correspondence Data may include the communication content and metadata associated with the communication.

The Profile Data may be processed for the purposes of providing you a better user experience when using the Services. The legal basis for this processing is your consent. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Information We Automatically Collect from Your Use of the Services.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>When you use the Services, we may automatically process information about your computer and internet connection (including your IP address, operating system and browser type), your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, cookie information, as well as information about the timing, frequency and pattern of your service use (<strong>“Service Data”</strong>). The Service Data is processed for the purpose of providing our Services. The legal basis for this processing is the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, to enable us to comply with legal obligations and our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the functionalities of the Services.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Information We Collect from Third Parties.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>You may choose to connect the Services to your accounts on third party services such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Shopify, Etsy and Youtube (<strong>“Social Networking Service”</strong>) for the purpose of managing your social media presence through our Services. When you do this, we automatically process personal information about you on such Social Networking Services, including your account and profile data, RSS, lists of followers, social media content and your actions with respect to such content (the “Social Media Information”). The Social Media Information is processed for the purposes of optimizing your social media activity on the Social Networking Services and administering our Services. The legal basis for the processing of Social Media Information is the performance of a contract between you and us and/or taking steps, at your request, to enter into such a contract.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Data</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We may disclose your personal data to any member of our group of companies (this means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and all its subsidiaries) insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes, and on the legal bases, set out in this policy.</li>
  <li>Financial transactions relating to the Services are handled by our payment services providers, [Paypal, Braintree, Stripe]. We will share Payment Information with our payment services providers only to the extent necessary for the purposes of processing your payments, refunding such payments and dealing with complaints and queries relating to such payments and refunds. You can find information about the payment services providers' privacy policies and practices at [<a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full" target="_blank">https://www.paypal.com/in/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full</a>, <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal" target="_blank">https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy/" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/us/privacy/</a>].</li>
  <li>We may disclose personal data to Social Networking Services insofar as reasonably necessary to allow you to manage your social media presence through our Services.</li>
  <li>We may disclose Service Data to a variety of third party service providers insofar as reasonably necessary to improve the functionalities of the Services.

  <li>In addition to the specific disclosures of personal data set out in this Section ‎3, we may disclose your personal data if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person; to protect the safety or integrity of the Services, or to explain why we have removed content or accounts from the Services; or to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use the Services.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>International transfers of your personal data</strong></p>
<p>In this Section 4, we provide information about the circumstances in which your personal data may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). We and our other group companies have offices and facilities in the United States and India. To facilitate our operations we may transfer, store, and process your information within those countries or with service providers based in Europe, India, Asia Pacific and North America. Laws in these countries may differ from the laws applicable to your Country of Residence. For example, information collected within the EEA may be transferred, stored, and processed outside of the EEA for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Where we transfer store, and process your personal information outside of the EEA we have ensured that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure an adequate level of data protection.</p>
<ul>
  <li>EU-US Privacy Shield Framework</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Crowdfire complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personally Identifiable Information transferred from the European Union to the United States.  Crowdfire has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.</li>
    <li>Individuals may file a complaint concerning Crowdfire’s processing of their Personally Identifiable Information. Crowdfire will take steps to remedy issues arising out of its alleged failure to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles. Individuals may contact Crowdfire as specified below about complaints regarding the company’s Personally Identifiable Information practices.</li>
    <li>If an Individuals’ complaint cannot be resolved through Crowdfire's internal processes, Crowdfire will cooperate with JAMS pursuant to the JAMS International Mediation Rules, available on the JAMS website at www.jamsadr.com/international-mediation-rules. Individuals may launch a Privacy Shield case by visiting https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield.  JAMS mediation may be commenced as provided for in the relevant JAMS rules. The mediator may propose any appropriate remedy, such as deletion of the relevant Personally Identifiable Information, publicity for findings of noncompliance, payment of compensation for losses incurred as a result of noncompliance, or cessation of processing of the Personally Identifiable Information of the Individual who brought the complaint. The mediator or the individual also may refer the matter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has Privacy Shield investigatory and enforcement powers over Crowdfire. Under certain circumstances, Individuals also may be able to invoke binding arbitration to address complaints about Crowdfire’s compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Transfers to our subsidiary in India, to our service providers and other third parties will be protected by appropriate safeguards, namely the use of standard data protection clauses adopted or approved by the European Commission or applicable certification schemes - for example, the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Your Rights with Regard to Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>In this Section ‎5, we have summarized the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your principal rights under data protection law are:</li>
  <ul>

Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. You can access your personal data by following the instructions <a href="https://web.crowdfireapp.com/#/settings/profile">here</a>.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>consent; or</li>
    <li>that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. You can download your account information, by following the instructions <a href="#export">here</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</li>
  <li>You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us, in addition to the other methods specified in this Section ‎5.</li>
</ul>
