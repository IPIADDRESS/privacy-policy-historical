<h1>PRIVACY AND SECURITY NOTICE  </h1>



<p><b>Thank you for visiting the Department of Justice's Web site and reviewing our

<p><b>PRIVACY</b></p>

<p>Here is how we handle information about your visit to our Web site:</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information Collected and Stored Automatically</b> 
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If you visit our site to read or download information, we collect and store the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             
following information about your&nbsp; visit:
</p><p></p><blockquote><blockquote> - &nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the 
Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet 
access account, or&nbsp; "yourschool.edu" if you are connecting from a 
university's domain) and the IP address (a number that is automatically assigned 
to your computer when you are using the Internet) from which you access our 
site;
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p></p>- &nbsp;&nbsp; The type of browser and operating system used to access 
our site;
<p></p>- &nbsp;&nbsp; The date and time you access our site; 
<p></p>- &nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet address of the Web site from which you linked 
directly to our site; and
<p></p>- &nbsp;&nbsp; The pages you visit and the information you request.
<p></p></blockquote>


<p> </p><blockquote>This information is primarily collected for 
  statistical analysis and technical improvements to the site. This government 
  computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which may 
  be used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least 
  interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system 
  performance or problem areas. In certain circumstances, however, we may take 
  additional steps to identify you based on this information and we may share 
  this information, including your identity, with other government agencies.</blockquote>

<p></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp; 
 B.&nbsp;&nbsp; If You Send Us Personal Information</b></p>

<p></p><blockquote> If you choose to provide us with personal 
  information, such as by sending an e-mail or by filling out a form and 
  submitting it through our Web site, we will use that information to respond to 
  your message or to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication. Remember 
  that e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your 
  communication is sensitive or includes personal information you may prefer to 
  send it by postal mail instead. 
  <p></p>
<p> We may share the information you give us with another government agency if 
  your inquiry relates to that agency. In other limited circumstances, such as 
  responses to requests from Congress and private individuals, we may be required 
  by law to disclose information you submit. Before you submit personal information, 
  such as on an online form, you may be given more specific guidance as to how 
  your personal information may be used.</p>
<p> Electronically submitted information is maintained and 
  destroyed according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and the 
  regulations and records schedules of the National Archives and Records 
  Administration, and in some cases may be covered by the Privacy Act and 
  subject to the Freedom of Information Act.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies</b></p>

<p></p><blockquote> "Cookies" are small bits of text that are 
  either used for the duration of a session ("session cookies"), or saved on a 
  user's hard drive in order to identify that user, or information about that 
  user, the next time the user logs on to a Web site ("persistent cookies"). The 
  Department's Web site and its component sites do not use persistent cookies. 
  One or more of the Department's component sites may use session cookies to 
  provide streamlined navigation throughout their sites. These session cookies 
  are deleted from the component's server soon after your session ends and are 
  not collected or saved.

<p><b>SECURITY</b></p>

<p> For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available 
  to all users, this Government computer system employs software programs to monitor 
  network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, 
  or otherwise cause damage. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such 
  monitoring and is advised that if such monitoring reveals evidence of possible 
  abuse or criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to appropriate law 
  enforcement officials. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information 
  on this server are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law, including 
  the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure 
  Protection Act of 1996.</p></blockquote>
