	<h1>Privacy</h1>
	<h2>JustEngineers Privacy Statement</h2>
	
	<p>
		<strong>
			JustEngineers has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm 
			commitment to privacy. At JustEngineers and our Associated Companies, we take your privacy seriously. Please be assured that we will safeguard any information that you provide. We will never release your personal details to other companies without your express permission. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for 
			all web sites operated by Jobsite UK (Worldwide) Ltd.
		</strong>
	</p>
	<h3>The Protection of Your CV</h3>
	<p>
		We regard your CV as a very personal document and we wish you to have full control over who can view it and whether 
		or not you wish to have your contact details (name, address, telephone number, email address etc) visible to 
		recruiters.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an operator of a number of international recruitment websites, we give you the option of putting your CV 
		in our searchable database which is a significant aid to quickly finding employment. We provide you a choice in how 
		you do this. The choice allows you to select the level of confidentiality that you believe is appropriate.
	</p>
	<p>
		The level of control is provided to you by your choice of whether to make your CV searchable by our Clients or not.  
		Making your CV searchable considerably increases your exposure to potential employers. To prevent your CV from being 
		searched and viewed by our Clients you should choose to "hide" your CV during the registration process. Choosing 
		"hide" means that your CV is not accessible by any recruiter but you can gain access to it and use it when applying 
		for individual jobs.
	</p>
	<p>
		We use our best efforts to limit access to our CV services to recruiters who agree to abide by our terms and 
		conditions.  If any recruiter is found to be breaching these terms and conditions, then we will immediately terminate 
		their use of our services. A link to our client terms and conditions may be found at the bottom of this page. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database 
		may have retained a copy of your CV in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy 
		of your CV by recruiters in these instances.
	</p>  
	<h3>Jobs by Email Service</h3> 
	<p>
		The Jobs by Email service matches a job seekers requirements for employment with the profile of vacancies advertised 
		on any one of our Sites. For job seekers who subscribe to this service you receive an email listing those jobs that 
		we believe you should be interested in. Your requirements are defined by you using "strings" which can be used to 
		specify geographic region, specific job titles, skills or other definition of the job you want. You can change the 
		strings at any time or unsubscribe at any time.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Email-a-Friend</h3>
	<p>
		Our Email-a-Friend service makes it easy for our users to recommend jobs to friends or relatives. Simply complete the
		Email-a-Friend form and we will send an email to your specified recipient(s) containing a link to the selected job. We
		will not use your recipient's details for any other purpose than the fulfillment of this service.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Application Forms and Psychometric Tests</h3>
	<p>
		When you apply for positions with some of our Clients, you will be requested to complete an application form and may 
		be requested to take a psychometric test. The information submitted by you on the application form or any psychometric 
		test paper will be used by our Client to assess your suitability for the position to which it applies. We are not 
		responsible for framing the questions in our Client's application forms or psychometric test papers, and merely 
		provide the electronic means to enable our Client to present the application form or psychometric test paper to you, 
		and to collect the application form or psychometric test paper once it has been completed by you. We do not process 
		any of the data in completed forms or papers other than psychometric test scores, which we present to our Clients in 
		our applicants' database. We may, however, temporarily store your completed forms or papers.
	</p> 
	<p>
		Our psychometric specialist suppliers may administer tests on our behalf and on behalf of our Clients. If we use a 
		specialist, we will ensure that only an anonymous identifier and your psychometric test paper is disclosed to the 
		specialist so that the specialist will be unable to identify you. We will keep the database matching your details 
		to the anonymous identifier confidential, and will not disclose it to any third parties.
	</p>  
	<p>
		You expressly agree, acknowledge and accept that we provide this service as a mere conduit for the applications forms.  
		Whilst we will use our best endeavours to ensure that the application form is suitable for its purpose using suitable 
		protection methods, please note that we do not guarantee that our protection methods will ensure that the application 
		form does not include:
	</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>false, inaccurate or misleading information;</li>
		<li>material that infringes third party's Intellectual Property Rights;</li>
		<li>defamatory, libellous or otherwise unlawful information;</li>
		<li>information that violate any law, statute, regulation or order (including, 
			without limitation, those concerning consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination or the 
			advertising prohibited goods or services); or</li>
		<li>any virus, worm, Trojan horse, time bomb, cancelbot or other code that contains 
		contaminating or destructive properties.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Consequently, we cannot accept any liability for any direct or indirect damages (including, without limitation, loss 
		of profits, loss of contracts), or any consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or any other monetary or other 
		damages or liabilities arising out of or relating to your use of the application form. In addition, we reserve the 
		right to remove your completed application form and suspend our services in relation to it if we consider in our 
		absolute discretion that providing the service may incur a legal liability for you, our Clients, or us. 
	</p>  
	<p>

		below.
