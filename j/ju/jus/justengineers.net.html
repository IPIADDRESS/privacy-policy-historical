      <div class="title">JobsGroup.net Privacy Statement</div>
      <p>JobsGroup.net Limited has created this privacy  statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. 
        The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for all web  sites operated by 
        JobsGroup.net Limited.</p>
      <p><strong>1) The Protection of  Your CV </strong></p>
      <p>We regard your CV as a very personal document and we wish  you to have full control over who can view it and whether
	  or not you wish to  have your contact details (name, address, telephone number, email address etc)  visible to recruiters.</p>
      <p>As an operator of a number of international recruitment  websites, we give you the option of putting your CV in our
	  searchable database  which is a significant aid to quickly finding employment. We provide you a  choice in how you do this.
	  The choice allows you to select the level of  confidentiality that you believe is appropriate.</p>
      <p>The level of control is provided to you by your choice of  whether to make your CV searchable by our Clients or not.
	  Making your CV  searchable considerably increases your exposure to potential employers. To  prevent your CV from being
	  searched and viewed by our Clients you should choose  to "hide" your CV during the registration process. Choosing 
	  "hide" means that your CV is not accessible by any recruiter but you  can gain access to it and use it when applying
	  for individual jobs.</p>
      <p>We use our best efforts to limit access to our CV services  to recruiters who agree to abide by our terms and conditions. 
	  If any recruiter  is found to be breaching these terms and conditions, then we will immediately  terminate their use of our
	  services. A link to our client terms and conditions  may be found at the bottom of this page.</p>
      <p>You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any  time. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the
	  database may have  retained a copy of your CV in their own files or databases. We are not  responsible for the retention, 
	  use, or privacy of your CV by recruiters in  these instances.</p>
      <p><em>This site uses a tool which collects your requests for pages and  passes elements of them to search engines to assist them in indexing  this site. We control the configuration of the tool and are responsible  for any information sent to the search engines</em></p>
      <p><strong>2) Jobs by Email Service</strong></p>
      <p>The Jobs by Email service matches a job seekers requirements  for employment with the profile of vacancies advertised
	  on any one of our  Sites. For job seekers who subscribe to this service you receive an email  listing those jobs that we
	  believe you should be interested in. Your  requirements are defined by you using "strings" which can be used to 
	  specify geographic region, specific job titles, skills or other definition of  the job you want. You can change the strings
	  at any time or unsubscribe at any  time.</p>
      <p><em>This site uses a tool which collects your requests for pages and  passes elements of them to search engines to assist them in indexing  this site. We control the configuration of the tool and are responsible  for any information sent to the search engines</em></p>
      <p><strong>3) Application Forms</strong></p>
      <p>When you apply for positions with some of our Clients, you  will be requested to complete an application form. The
	  information submitted by  you on the application form will be used by our Client to assess your suitability  for the position
	  to which it applies. We are not responsible for framing the  questions in our Client's application forms, and merely provide
	  the electronic  means to enable our Client to present the application form to you, and to  collect the application form once
	  it has been completed by you. We do not  process any of the data in completed forms, which we present to our Clients in our
	  applicants' database. We may, however, temporarily store your completed  forms.</p>
      <p>You expressly agree, acknowledge and accept that we provide  this service as a mere conduit for the applications forms.
	  Whilst we will use  our best endeavours to ensure that the application form is suitable for its  purpose using suitable
	  protection methods, please note that we do not guarantee  that our protection methods will ensure that the application form
	  does not include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>false, inaccurate or misleading information; </li>
        <li>material that infringes third party's  Intellectual Property Rights; </li>
        <li>defamatory, libellous or otherwise unlawful  information;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
        <li>information that violate any law, statute, regulation or order (including, without limitation, those concerning consumer 
		protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination or the advertising  prohibited goods or services); or </li>
        <li>any virus, worm, Trojan horse, time bomb, cancelbot or other code that contains contaminating or destructive properties. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Consequently, we cannot accept any liability for any direct  or indirect damages (including, without limitation, loss of profits,
	  loss of  contracts), or any consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or any other  monetary or other damages or liabilities
	  arising out of or relating to your use  of the application form. In addition, we reserve the right to remove your  completed
	  application form and suspend our services in relation to it if we  consider in our absolute discretion that providing the service
	  may incur a  legal liability for you, our Clients, or us. </p>
      <p>If you have any concerns over any application form, please  contact us for advice. Our contact details are set out below. </p>
