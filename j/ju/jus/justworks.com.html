      </p>
      <p>
          We use cookies to personalize our Site for you and to collect aggregate information about site usage by all of our users. A cookie is a text file that our
          Site transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the quality of your visit to our Site. The cookie assigns a random,
          unique number to your computer Cookies are small text files that our Site places on your browser to enable our system to recognize your computer and allow
          us to see how you use our site. Further general information about cookies and how they work is available at www.allaboutcookies.org.
      </p>
      <p>
          The cookies we use on our Site include:
      </p>
      <p>
          Session cookies: These temporary cookies expire and are automatically erased whenever you close your browser window. We use session cookies to grant our
          users access to content and to enable actions they must be logged in to do.
      </p>
      <p>
          Persistent cookies: These usually have an expiration date in the distant future and remain in your browser until they expire or you manually delete them.
          We use persistent cookies to better understand usage patterns so we can improve the site for our customers. For example, we may use a persistent cookie to
          associate you with your user account or to remember that your choices on the Site, but this only works when cookies on our site are enabled.
      </p>
      <p>
          Third party cookies: We permit limited third parties to place cookies through the Site to provide us with better insights into the use of the Site or user
          demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you. For example, we utilize Google Analytics to analyze usage patterns of the Site. Google Analytics
          generates a cookie to capture information about your use of the Site which Google uses to compile reports on website activity for us and to provide other
          related services. Google may use a portion of your IP address to identify their cookie, but this will not be associated with any other data held by Google.
      </p>
      <p>
          We may also permit third party service providers to place cookies through our Site, as indicated above, to perform analytic or marketing functions where
          you are notified of them and you have consented to the usage. We do not control the use of such third party cookies or the resulting information and we are
          not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

          Your use of our Site will be deemed to be your consent to the placement of cookies on your computer or other device. If you prefer not to receive cookies
          through our Site, you can set your browser to either reject all cookies, to allow only "trusted" websites to set them, or to accept only those cookies from
          those sites you are currently on. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log
          on to our Site and use it.
      </p>
      <p>
          If you refuse cookies, this will limit system performance and may even cause certain features of the Site to malfunction or not to work at all.
