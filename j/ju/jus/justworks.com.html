    <p>
        <u>Cookies</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        We use cookies to personalize our Site for you and to collect aggregate information about site usage by all of our users. A cookie is a text file that our
        Site transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the quality of your visit to our Site. The cookie assigns a random,
        unique number to your computer Cookies are small text files that our Site places on your browser to enable our system to recognize your computer and allow
        us to see how you use our site. Further general information about cookies and how they work is available at www.allaboutcookies.org.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cookies we use on our Site include:
    </p>
    <p>
        Session cookies: These temporary cookies expire and are automatically erased whenever you close your browser window. We use session cookies to grant our
        users access to content and to enable actions they must be logged in to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        Persistent cookies: These usually have an expiration date in the distant future and remain in your browser until they expire or you manually delete them.
        We use persistent cookies to better understand usage patterns so we can improve the site for our customers. For example, we may use a persistent cookie to
        associate you with your user account or to remember that your choices on the Site, but this only works when cookies on our site are enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third party cookies: We permit limited third parties to place cookies through the Site to provide us with better insights into the use of the Site or user
        demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you. For example, we utilize Google Analytics to analyze usage patterns of the Site. Google Analytics
        generates a cookie to capture information about your use of the Site which Google uses to compile reports on website activity for us and to provide other
        related services. Google may use a portion of your IP address to identify their cookie, but this will not be associated with any other data held by Google.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also permit third party service providers to place cookies through our Site, as indicated above, to perform analytic or marketing functions where
        you are notified of them and you have consented to the usage. We do not control the use of such third party cookies or the resulting information and we are
        not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your use of our Site will be deemed to be your consent to the placement of cookies on your computer or other device. If you prefer not to receive cookies
        through our Site, you can set your browser to either reject all cookies, to allow only "trusted" websites to set them, or to accept only those cookies from
        those sites you are currently on. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log
        on to our Site and use it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you refuse cookies, this will limit system performance and may even cause certain features of the Site to malfunction or not to work at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Use of Information</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of your information is subject to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use in effect at the time of use. The provisions contained herein supersede all
        previous notices or statements regarding our privacy practices with respect to this Site.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use aggregated data (independent of any personal identifiers) for research and commercial purposes. This information includes what areas our users
        visit most frequently and what services they access most often. This information helps us develop a better site that is more useful and accessible to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use your PII internally for our general commercial purposes including, among other things, to offer our own, our affiliates' or third-party products
        and services that we think you may find of interest, but only Company, its subsidiaries<strong> </strong>and its service providers involved in distributing
        the offers or providing the products or services will have access to your PII. Our subsidiaries and service providers will be required to use any PII we
        provide them only for that intended purpose. <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use your email address to contact you to respond to your inquiries or to provide information on products or services to you.

    <p>
        <u>Disclosing Your Information</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may reveal Personally Identifiable Information about you to unaffiliated third parties: (1) if you request or authorize it; (2) if the information is
        provided to help complete a transaction for you; (3) if the information is provided to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and
        quasi-governmental requests, court orders or subpoenas, to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements, or to protect our rights, property or safety or

        part of a purchase, transfer or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another party, customer
        information may be one of the transferred assets); (5) if the information is provided to our agents, outside vendors or service providers to perform
        functions on our behalf (e.g., analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing customer service, processing payroll or taxes, etc.); or (6) as
        otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-Personal Information, such as usage statistics of our Products, to our affiliates and third
