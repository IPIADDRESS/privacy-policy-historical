<ol>
  <li id="information-we-collect"> <h3>Information we collect from you and why</h3>
    <div>
      <p> The personal information that we may collect about you broadly falls into the following categories: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Information that you provide voluntarily
          <br>
          <p> Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. </p>
          <p> For instance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <em>Registration information:</em> When you create a Just Eat account, sign-up or fill in forms on the Services, we collect information about you including your name, address, telephone number, email address and the password you create. </li>
            <li> <em>Transaction information:</em> We collect information relating to your Orders, including payment information (e.g. your credit card number) using the secure services of our payment processors. Payment operations are outsourced to our payment processors and we do not store your credit card information in our systems. We also collect delivery details (e.g. your physical address) to fulfil each Order.</li>
            <li> <em>Information regarding your marketing preferences:</em> We collect information about your preferences to receive marketing information any time you subscribe or unsubscribe.</li>
            <li> <em> Feedback:</em> When you post messages and reviews of the Services or you contact us, for example with a question, problem or comment, we collect information about you including your name and the content of your query. If you contact our customer support teams we will record and keep a record of your conversation for quality and training purposes and to aid in the resolution of your queries.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Information that we collect automatically
          <br>
          <p>
          When you access our Services, we may collect certain information automatically from your device. In some countries, including countries in Europe, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.</p>
          <p>For instance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Activity information:</em> We collect information about your usage of the Services and information about you from the content you create and the notifications or messages you post or send as well as what you search for, look at and engage with. </li>
            <li><em>Cookies and similar technologies:</em> We use cookies and similar tracking technology to collect and use personal information about you (e.g. your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your device ID, your browser type and when, how often and how long you interact with the Services), including to facilitate interest-based advertising. 
            <br>
            For further information about the types of cookies and similar technologies we use, why, and how you can control such technologies, see our <a href="/cookies-policy">Cookies Policy</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Information that we obtain from third party sources.
          <br>
          <p>From time to time, we may receive personal information from third party sources, including advertising networks but only where we have checked that these third parties either have your consent to process the information or are otherwise legally permitted or required to share your personal information with us. This information may include your likely demographic group. </p>
          <p>For instance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <em>Analytics reports and market research surveys:</em> We collect information from our third party affiliates about the way you respond to and engage with our marketing campaigns so that we can customise our marketing and Services accordingly.</li>
            <li>We may also receive aggregated information in the form of audience segments from third party sources in order to display targeted advertising on digital properties operated by organisations like Facebook and Google. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Our use of collected information </h3>
      <p>Examples of how we may use this information include: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Information that you provide voluntarily </li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Registration information </em>
              <p>The registration information you provide when you create a Just Eat account allows us to give you access to the Services and to supply them to you under our Terms. We also use this information to authenticate your access to the Services, to contact you for your views and to notify you of important changes or updates to our Services.</p>
            </li>
            <li><em>Transaction information</em>

              <p>Just Eat may contact you by email, phone or SMS to give you status updates or other information or to resolve problems with your account or Order.  A Restaurant may contact you by phone or SMS to provide you with status updates or other information regarding your Order. </p>
              <p>Where you pay for your Order with a mobile payment or digital wallet service provider (such as Applepay or Pay with Google) we will send you transaction information via confirmation emails or SMS to the email address or phone number registered with that service provider (since this is required by those providers). </p>
              <p>Some Restaurants on our platform use our third party delivery companies; these companies may use your information to provide you with status updates on the delivery of your Order.</p>
              <p>We will also analyse information on completed transactions and successfully delivered Orders on the basis of data matching or statistical analysis so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our business and Services. Our analyses also help us detect and prevent fraud or other illegal activities or acts prohibited by our Terms or any policies applicable to the Services. </p>
            </li>
            <li><em>Information regarding your marketing preferences</em>
              <p>Just Eat may market to you, where permitted by law, by post, email, telephone, mobile (i.e. SMS, in-app messaging and push notification) about our products or Services. </p>
              <p>Where you have given your consent, we may share your information with third parties (e.g. other companies) in other sectors (such as food, drink and entertainment) so that they can tell you about goods or services which may interest you. </p>
              <p>If you don’t want us to use your data in this way or generally change your mind about receiving any form of marketing communications, you can unsubscribe at any time using the unsubscribe functionality in the communication you receive or by amending your profile accordingly. You may also be able to opt-out of push notifications at a device level (e.g. by way of your iOS settings). If you choose to unsubscribe from our marketing, we will keep a record of your preferences so that we don’t bother you with unwanted marketing in future.</p>
            </li>
            <li><em>Feedback and reviews</em>
              <p>If you give us feedback we will use it to reply to your questions or queries, to provide customer support and resolve any problems with your Orders or with the Services. We will publish reviews that you send to us about the Restaurants on our platform and our Services in general and we also analyse your feedback to improve and develop our Services and in order to enhance your experience. 
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        
        <li>	Information that we collect automatically 
          <p> When you access our Services, we may collect certain information automatically from your device such as your IP address, MAC address or device ID.

              <p>We analyse your buying habits and how you interact with our Services so that we can suggest food options from new restaurants we think you would like to try.  If you choose to share your geo-location with us, we may use this information to show you content that is local to you; this information will also help smooth the effective and speedy delivery of your Order. We may also provide you with customised content and advertisements based on your previous interactions with our Services and our knowledge of your preferences which we understand from your usage and buying history relating to the Services.</p>
              <p>We enable you to access your Order history so that you can easily reorder with your favourite Restaurants. We may also collect information about your interaction with our emails and other forms of communication. </p>
            </li>
            <li><em>Cookies and similar technologies </em>
              <p>We work with advertising affiliates that serve advertisements on our Services on the websites and services of third parties. Some of those networks use cookies which allow us to display advertisements that are personalised to your interests based upon your internet browsing activity.</p>
              <p>Like many websites and online services we use cookies and other technologies to maintain a record of your interaction with our Services.

  <li id="who-we-share"><h3>Who we share personal information </h3>with
    <div>
      <p>In delivering the Services to you, depending on the circumstances, we may share your personal information with the following entities:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Restaurants you place Orders with so that the Restaurant can process and deliver it to you. </li>
        <li> Companies within the Just Eat group of companies (which means our subsidiaries and affiliates, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries and affiliates either now or at any time in the future) - these companies act for us and process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li>	Third parties who undertake various activities to promote and support our Services. This includes offshore customer support agents, website and application support and hosting providers, marketing service providers, eCRM partners like Salesforce who manage our marketing emails and push notifications, companies like Twilio who send you text messages when your Order is on its way, delivery companies who deliver your Order to you, market research companies and payment processing providers which process payment card transactions - any of these third parties might be inside or outside your country of residence. </li>
        <li>As mentioned in section 2 above, we may also share information with third parties (for example, in the food, drink and entertainment sectors) so that they can contact you about goods or services which may interest you.  We will only share your information with these third parties where you have given your consent. If you don’t want us to use your personal information in this way or generally change your mind about receiving any form of marketing communications, you can unsubscribe at any time using the unsubscribe functionality in the communication you receive or by amending your profile accordingly. If you choose to unsubscribe from our marketing, we will keep a record of your preferences so that we don’t bother you with unwanted marketing in future.</li>
        <li> If any part of our business enters into a joint venture, purchases another business or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed or transferred to the target company, or new business partners or owners or their agents and advisors.  In these circumstances we will always inform the relevant entities that they must only use your personal information for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy. </li>
        <li>	Any law enforcement or regulatory body, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.</li>

    </div>
  </li>
  <li id="legal-basis"> <h3>Legal basis for processing personal information</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information as described above will depend on the specific context in which we collect it.  
      </p>
      <p>Our main reason for collecting and using your personal information is to perform our contract with you (i.e. to make sure you get your Order when you want it). However we will also use your personal information where it is in our legitimate business interests to do so (but only if our interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or your fundamental legal rights and freedoms). In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you (e.g. in the event of legal proceedings) or we might need to process it or share it with others to “protect your vital interests” (this is legal speak for saving your life) or those of another person (e.g. in a case where another person’s life is in danger). </p>
      <p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (and we’ll also explain the possible consequences of you not providing it).  </p>
      <p>Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>
      <p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “<strong>How to contact us</strong>” <a href="#contact-details">below</a>.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li id="international-data-transfers"><h3>International data transfers</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We may transfer your personal information to countries other than the country in which you are resident. Just Eat’s website servers are mainly located in the United Kingdom, however our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate in a number of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, the Philippines, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and United Kingdom. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
      </p>
      <p>Whilst these countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country, you can rest assured that Just Eat takes care to implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information in those countries in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Some of the safeguards we rely on include, where appropriate, using the European Commission’s approved standard contractual clauses with our suppliers, intra-group transfer agreements (so that we can safely transfer your data between the Just Eat group of companies all over the world) and contracting with Privacy Shield certified companies in the United States, where this is appropriate. </p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li id="security"><h3>Security </h3>
    <div>
      <p>We place great importance on keeping your personal information safe and secure.  As such, we put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures / industry standard technology to protect it from unauthorised access and unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. </p>
      <p>The security measures we use are designed to provide a level of protection security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. Where you have chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your password with anyone and to use a unique password for our Services. We will not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into using your name and password. </p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li id="data-retention"><h3>Data retention</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Just Eat will retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, while you hold an account with us or to enable us to meet our legal, tax or accounting obligations). </p>
      <p>If you object to us processing certain categories of your personal information (including in relation to receiving marketing communications from us), we will retain a record of your objection to the processing of your information so that we can continue to respect your wishes.</p>
      <p>We will destroy or permanently anonymise your personal information at the point that we no longer need to process it for our ongoing legitimate business needs or for any legal reason. If this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store it and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
    </div>

  <li id="your-data-protection-rights"><h3>Your data protection rights</h3>

        <li>You have the right to complain  to a data protection supervisory authority about our collection and use of your personal information.</li>
      </ul>
