    <h3>How We Use Cookies, Web Beacons, And Similar Technologies</h3>

    <p>We (and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality on our Site) may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to facilitate website administration and navigation; to better understand and improve our Site; to determine and improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere; and to provide you with a rich online experience.  We provide more details about these technologies below.</p>

    <p>General descriptions of “cookies” and “web beacons”</p>
    <p>“Cookies” are small files that are placed on your computer or device when you visit a website.  Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognised as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites.</p>

    <p>Some cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around our Site and use its features, such as accessing secured areas.  Other cookies collect information about how visitors use the Site (for instance, which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages).  When combined with information collected when you register on a website, cookies allow us to welcome you back to the site or otherwise provide enhanced, more personal features.Cookies may also be used on our behalf by third parties managing our advertising on other websites to enable us to learn which advertisements bring visitors to our sites and to otherwise improve or target our online advertising.</p>

    <p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent.  If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies.  Please note that if you disable cookies, you may be unable to access some customised features on our Site.</p>

    <p>“Web beacons”and similar technologies are tiny or transparent images that, for example, allow us and third parties tocount the number of users who have visited a particular web page or to access certain cookies. When you access a page containing a beacon, you establish a communication with a web server, which collects certain information about your computer or device.  This information may include your IP address, browser type, operating system type, and identifiers that have been stored in cookies.  We may use beacons on our sites to count the number of visitors to our sites and to recognise users by accessing unique identifiers stored in cookies that we have set on their computers or devices. Being able to access these identifiers enables us to provide a personalised experience on our sites.  We may also include beacons in advertisements or in email messages to determine how these are acted on.</p>

    <h3>Cookies used for online behavioural advertising</h3>
    <p>Third parties who are involved in serving other companies’ advertising on our sites, or who are involved in determining which advertisements to show you on third-party websites, may use cookies to collect information about your online activities, such as the advertisements you have seen or the websites or pages you have visited, in order to draw inferences about what advertising might be relevant to you.</p>

    <p>These third parties may use the information gathered through these cookies to show you advertising they believe to be most relevant to you when you visit other websites not belonging to us.  This practice is called “online behavioural advertising.”</p>

    <p>For additional information on the types of cookies we use, please <a href="#CookieNotice">click here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Other uses of local storage and unique identifiers</h3>
    <p>We (and the third parties who provide content, advertising, or functionality on our sites) may also use other kinds of local storage technologies that operate similarly to cookies, such as local shared objects (also known as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage.  These technologies are similar to cookies in that they make use of storage on your device for the purpose of identifying the device across different services and sessions.  Please note, however, that these technologies may make use of different parts of your device than cookies do, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings.  For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html" target="_blank">please click here</a>.</p>

    <p>In addition, depending on the browser or device you use, we (and the third parties who provide content, advertising or functionality on our sites) may receive a identifier for your browser device that can be used for purposes similar to those for which we and others use cookies and beacons.  The identifiers are not created by the services you access, but rather by the companies that make the software that runs your device or browser.  For example, if you access our Site using Apple’s iOS 7 on your iPhone, we may receive a temporary device identifier called the “Identifier for Advertisers” (or “IDFA”).   In your iPhone’s privacy settings, you can “reset” this identifier, which means that a different identifier will be sent the next time you visit our Site.</p>


    <h3>How We May Share Information With Others</h3>

    <p>We may share the information we collect with the following types of entities, including those which may be located outside your country of residence:</p>

    <p>•	Affiliates.  We may share information within General Mills among our various businesses, and within our family of affiliated companies.</p>

    <p>•	Service Providers.  We may share information – including information that personally identifies you – with companies that provide services on our behalf.  These parties may use the information solely in conjunction with the specific services they provide for us.  Some service providers may be involved in administering or supplementing our databases and will need to have access to your information in order to do so.  For example, we may retain a third party to verify the accuracy of information within our databases or to gather additional information about individuals from commercially available sources.  As another example, we may provide information to third parties who help us target specific advertising communications to you when you visit other sites.</p>

    <p>•	Other Parties When Required by Law or as Necessary to Protect Our Users and Services. We also may disclose information – including information that personally identifies you – to third parties in order to:</p>
    <p>o	protect our legal rights, as well as the rights of the users of our Site or others</p>
    <p>o	protect the safety and security of the Site, its users, or others</p>
    <p>o	prevent fraud</p>
    <p>o	comply with the law or respond to legal process or a request for co-operation by a government entity, whether or not legally required.</p>

    <p>•	Other Parties in Connection with a Corporate Transaction.  We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy.  Outside this context, we will not sell any lists of consumer contact information to unaffiliated companies for their marketing purposes.</p>

    <p>•	Otherwise with Your Consent.  In addition to the sharing described or permitted by this Privacy Policy, we may of course share information about you with third parties whenever you affirmatively consent to such sharing.</p>


    <h3>Third Parties Who Provide Content, Advertising, Or Functionality On Our Site</h3>

    <p>Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Site may be provided by third parties who are not affiliated with us.  For example:</p>

    <p>•	Certain third parties may serve advertising or keep track of which advertisements users see, how often they see those advertisements, and what users do in response to them.  These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to provide these services.</p>

    <p>•	We may enable you to share certain materials on the Site with others through social networking services such as Facebook and Twitter.</p>

    <p>These third parties may collect or receive certain information about your use of the Site, including through the use of cookies, beacons, and similar technologies,and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected across different websites and online services.</p>

    <p>One of the third parties that provides services on our Site is Google Inc.  Like many websites, we use Google Analytics, a service that provides information about how many users visit our Site, when they visit, and how they navigate the Site once they are here.  Google offers a browser add-on that enables users to opt out of having data about their visits reported to websites by Google Analytics.  More information about the add-on is  <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en" target="_blank">here.</a></p>


    <h3>International Transfer Of Data</h3>

    <p>We may collect, transfer, store, and process your information outside your country of residence, consistent with this Privacy Policy.  Please note that the data protection and other laws of countries to which your information may be transferred might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.</p>


    <h3>Security For Credit Card Data And Transaction Information</h3>

    <p>We are committed to keeping your online transactions safe and secure. For example, in order to reasonably assure the privacy and security of your credit card data when making an order, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.  SSL uses encryption technology to create a secure connection between your computer and ours. We have also put procedures in place to safeguard other information we collect from you.  Please note, however, that we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any information you provide online; you provide it at your own risk.</p>


    <h3>Links To Other Sites</h3>

    <p>Our Site may contain links to the sites of our affiliates, and to sites that are owned and operated by third parties.  These other sites may have their own privacy policies and are not be governed by this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of sites owned and operated by third parties. Other sites may collect and treat information collected differently, so we encourage you to carefully read and review the privacy policy for each site you visit.</p>


    <h3>User-Generated Content And Public Profile Features</h3>

    <p>Our Site may, from time to time, contain interactive areas where Site users might submit comments or other content (including information about the user that might be displayed in the user’s public profile within an online community) that may be visible to others. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email address, etc.) in content submitted for posting or publication, the information can be read and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. We make no representations and undertake no obligations as to the security or use of information you voluntarily include when submitting content.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                            <h3>Send-To-A-Friend Tools</h3>

    <p>This Site may, from time to time, include a send-to-a-friend application that makes it easy for you to forward information or materials from our Site to friends or family by email.  In order to address your email message, the application may ask you to input the recipient’s email address and/or similar information (including your email address). This information is used by the applicationto address your message so that it can be properly sent.  We may temporarily maintain a log of this information for troubleshooting and fraud-prevention purposes.  In the event that we are offering you some form of referral award for encouraging an action on the part of the recipient (for example, if you are to earn a reward if the recipient chooses to register for one of our offerings after receiving the email from you), we may also retain the information as necessary to establish that the referral award was earned.</p>


    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

    <p>This Site is not directed to children and we will not request any information from children under 13 at this Site. General Mills does have other sites that are geared in whole or in part to a child audience. Our commitment to the privacy of children is described more fully in the privacy policies of those sites. General Mills and its affiliated companies take special care to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13. We also recommend that parents monitor their children’s Internet activities and learn and employ software or other tools that can help their children enjoy the fun and entertainment of an online experience without compromising their personal safety or allowing them to use the Internet in a manner inconsistent with their parents’ preferences.</p>


    <h3>Accessing Your Information</h3>

    <p>Under the laws of some jurisdictions, you may have the right to request details about the information we collect and to correct inaccuracies in that information.  If you would like to make a request to access your information, or to delete your information, please contact our customer service department at brandanswers.uk@genmills.com.  You may also object to direct marketing by sending a request to brandanswers.uk@genmills.com.</p>
