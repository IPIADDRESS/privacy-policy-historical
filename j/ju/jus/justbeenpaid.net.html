  <p><strong>&nbsp;1.1. In compliance with the&nbsp;Data Protection Act 1998, the   following information relates to the processing by us of your personal   data.&nbsp; Please note that in this privacy policy, “we” or “us” refers to   the UK Commission for Employment and Skills trading as JUSTBEENPAID.NET Investors in   People.</strong></p>
  <p>1.2. We are   committed to complying with the provisions of the&nbsp;Data Protection Act   1998&nbsp;and ensuring that the personal data we hold is processed fairly and   lawfully.&nbsp; This Privacy Statement has therefore been prepared to tell   you about the way we collect information from you and what we do with   that information. If any part of this statement changes, we will tell   you via our homepage at&nbsp;http://justbeenpaid.net.</p>
  <p>1.3.&nbsp;   If you have any questions about this statement or your personal   information that we may collect from you, please contact us at&nbsp;info@justbeenpaid.net.</p>
  <p>1.4.   This Privacy Policy explains how we collect information from you when   you visit or register to use the Site and how this information is then   used. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and re-visit this page   from time to time to review any changes that may have been made.</p>
  <p>1.5.&nbsp;   We are registered as a data controller in accordance with&nbsp;United   Kingdom Data Protection Act 1998. We will process any personal   information we collect about you in accordance with the&nbsp;Data Protection   Act 1998.</p>
  <p>1.6. This Privacy Policy applies to you whether you use the Site as a casual browser or if you have registered with the Site.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT, AND HOW IS THAT INFORMATION THEN USED?</strong></p>
  <p><br>
      <strong>Information collected when you browse the Site</strong></p>
  <p>2.1.   Your IP Address: like most websites, each time you visit the Site we   automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you   came. We use this information to administer and optimise the Site for   you and to diagnose problems with our Site. We use your IP address to   help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you.</p>
  <p>2.2.   We will not collect any personal information about you from your   browsing of the Site unless you agree to collection and use of your   personal data by providing that information to us.</p>
  <p><strong>Information collected when you register to the Site or download a publication via a ‘Web form’</strong></p>
  <p>2.3.   When you register to the Site, you may be asked to submit personal   information about yourself in order to register and/or upload Content.   This information may include, for example, your name, address, job   title, telephone number, fax number, email address and postal address.   We will only collect information that is necessary for us to allow you   to upload Content and for us to provide you with any services or   assistance connected with that Content.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>HOW WILL WE USE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>2.4.&nbsp;   Where we collect personal information, we will use it for   administration and to tailor our service and/or products to match your   needs. We may also use personal information to conduct market research   surveys, for statistical analysis to determine Site usage, to run   competitions (and for direct marketing purposes relating to our   business).</p>
  <p>2.5. We may   employ the services of a third party to help us in certain areas, such   as delivery of IIP services ("Delivery Centres"), site or CRM hosting,   marketing and market researching. In some cases that third party may   receive your information. However, at all times we will control and be   responsible for the use of your information.</p>
  <p>2.6&nbsp;We   work closely with our appointed Investors in People “Delivery Centres”   in the UK and internationally that cover defined territories. Information shared with us, unless specified otherwise, will also be   shared with our appointed partner in the territory relevant to the   business address postcode provided by you. From time to time “Delivery   Centres” may change. If your data is being transferred we will notify   you, and give you the opportunity to opt out of having your data   transferred to the new partner, in advance of the migration taking   place. UKCES remains the data controller in all cases. Our appointed   "Delivery Centres" will use this data to: contact you, support you in   maintaining or obtaining an IIP accreditation, working with the IIP   Standard, provide updates back to us (UKCES) as data controller, refer   you to other services or products that may be of benefit to you,   introduce you to other businesses like yours and introduce offers from   appropriate sponsors to you. To opt out of any communications please   contact&nbsp;info@justbeenpaid.net.</p>
  <p>2.7.   At all times we are legally obliged to collect, retain and process any   personal information that you provide in accordance with the&nbsp;Data   Protection Act 1998. Each time you provide us with personal information   we aim to let you know how we intend to use it and ask you to give your   consent to such use.&nbsp; This will include (i) where we would like to use   that information to send you details of other products and services we   offer which are similar to the product/service for which you have   subscribed; and <br>
    (ii) where we would like to share that information with   certain selected third parties to allow them to provide you with details   of their services and/or products which might be of interest to you.</p>
  <p>2.8.   Your Personal Information may be shared with a third party in the event   of a transfer of ownership, transfer of "Delivery Centre", assets or a   bankruptcy of the UK Commission for Employment and   Skills&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;Investors&nbsp;in People. We may also disclose your Personal   Information as required or permitted by law, to protect the interests or   safety of&nbsp;the UK Commission for Employment and Skills,&nbsp;http://justbeenpaid.net/&nbsp;or   a third party, or to prevent an emergency. Any third party with whom we   share your Personal Information is authorised to use your Personal   Information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such   third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over   which we have no control. Those who contact you will need to be   instructed directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of   your Personal Information by them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>How can I remove, update, prevent use of or correct my personal information?</strong><br>
    2.9. Please refer to the “My Dashboard” section of the Site where you   can update, correct or delete your personal information as appropriate.&nbsp;   Should you wish us to change your contact preferences, you should also   go to “My Dashboard” or contact&nbsp;info@justbeenpaid.net&nbsp;to be removed from our lists.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>3.1.   We will hold your personal information securely and will only keep it   for as long as is reasonably necessary in the circumstances, or whilst   you are registered to use the Site, unless you have provided us with   your consent to use the data for any additional purposes.&nbsp; We take the   security of the Site and the information you provide very seriously and   we will take all appropriate technical measures using recognised   security procedures and tools in accordance with good industry practice   to protect your personal information.</p>
  <p>3.2.   Whilst we use all reasonable endeavours to protect your security in the   manner described above, we consider that it is only appropriate to   advise users that data transmission over the Internet and the World Wide   Web cannot always be guaranteed as 100% secure, and therefore that you   use the Site at your own risk. Accordingly, we assume no liability for   any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorised third   party access or other acts of third parties, or acts or omissions   beyond our reasonable control.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>OUR COOKIE POLICY</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>4.1.&nbsp;When   we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable.   Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves   placing small amounts of information on your device, for example,   computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies.</p>
  <p><strong>These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:</strong></p>
  <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enabling   a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same   information several times during one task</p>
  <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recognising   that you may already have given a username and password so you don't   need to do it for every web page requested</p>
  <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measuring   how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use   and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast</p>
  <p>4.2   The majority of browsers will allow you to alter the settings used for   cookies and to disable and enable them as you require.&nbsp; If you do not   want cookies then please refer to the “Help” menu on your browser for   instructions on disabling them.&nbsp; You can manage these small files   yourself and learn more about them through "<a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/managingcookies">Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them</a>"</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>4.3. Our use of cookies</strong></p>
  <p><br>
    4.3.1 Cookies for improving service</p>
  <p>We   use a Customer Relationship Management service called “Click   Dimensions”. This system sets cookies in your browser to enable us to   understand user behaviour, improve our service and provide users with   more relevant information. &nbsp;Click Dimensions uses three cookies:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Name: <strong>cuvid</strong><br>
    This cookie is&nbsp;typically written to the browser upon the first visit to the site&nbsp;<em>from&nbsp;that web browser</em>.   If the cookie has been deleted by the browser operator,&nbsp;and the browser   subsequently visits the site, a new&nbsp;__cuid&nbsp;cookie is written with a   different visitor unique ID. This cookie is used to&nbsp;determine unique   visitors to the site and it is updated with each page   view.&nbsp;Additionally, this cookie is provided with a unique ID that the   application&nbsp;uses to ensure both the validity and accessibility of the   cookie as an extra&nbsp;security measure. This cookie expires 2 years from   set/update.</p>
  <p>Name: <strong>cusid</strong></p>
  <p>This   cookie is&nbsp;used to establish and continue a user session with the site.   When a user&nbsp;views a page on the site, the script code attempts to update   this cookie. If it does not find the cookie, a new one is written and a   new session is&nbsp;established. Each time a user visits a different page on   the site, this&nbsp;cookie is updated to expire in 30 minutes, thus   continuing a single session for as long as user activity continues   within 30-minute intervals. This&nbsp;cookie expires when a user pauses on a   page on the site for longer than 30&nbsp;minutes. This cookie expires 30   minutes from set/update.</p>
  <p>Name: <strong>cuvon</strong><br>
    Used to signal&nbsp;the last time a visitor viewed a page. This cookie expires 30 minutes from set/update.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For more information about Click Dimensions <a href="http://help.clickdimensions.com/clickdimensions-cookies-for-web-analytics/">please visit their website.</a></p>
  <p>We   also use a service called “Google Analytics” to understand user   behaviour at different times of the day. Google Analytics sets cookies   to help us more accurately estimate the number of visitors to the   website and volumes of usage. This is to ensure that the service is   available when you want it and fast. We use the following cookies on   this site:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Name: _utma<br>
    Typical content: randomly generated number.&nbsp;<br>
    Expires: 2 years<br>
    Name: _utmb<br>
    Typical content: randomly generated number<br>

    Name: _utmc<br>
    Typical content: randomly generated number<br>

    Name: _utmz<br>

    Expires: 6 months</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For further details on the cookies set by Google Analytics please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/concepts/gaConceptsCookies.html#cookiesSet">Google code website</a>.</p>

    Expires: when user session ends</p>
  <p>4.4.   Third parties advertisers on the Site may also place cookies on your   browser. We will notify you of this when you attempt to access such an   area. Once you have closed your browser, the cookie is deactivated.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
  <p>5.1.   If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy these changes will be   detailed on this page in order to ensure that you are fully aware of   what information is collected, how it is used and under what   circumstances it will be disclosed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
