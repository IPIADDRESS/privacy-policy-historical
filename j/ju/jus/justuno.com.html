  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
</div>
<div class="container_12 wrap960">
<p>This Privacy Policy (this "Policy") describes how personal information is collected from users of the Justuno website at http://www.justuno.com (the "Site") and the Justuno coupon publishing service ("Coupon Publishing Service"), operated by Justuno, LLC. ("Justunos," "we," or "us")   and how that information is used and disclosed. The Coupon Publishing   Service is provided both through the Site and through third party sites   via framing techniques as described below ("Third Party Sites").   We encourage you to read this Policy carefully before providing any   personal information on the Site or Coupon Publishing Service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Information We Collect &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        We   collect "personal information" about users of the Site and the Coupon   Publishing Service in the normal course of our business. As used in this   Policy, "personal information"   is information that identifies or is capable of being associated with   an identifiable person. Some examples of personal information include a   user's name, address, and email address. Personal information does not   include aggregate information or de-identified information. "Aggregate information"   is information about the use of the Site, such as information collected   about Site users, or a category of services or users, from which any   personal information has been removed. An example of aggregate   information would be a report stating that forty-seven percent of the   Site's registered users identify themselves as male. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Most   of the personal information we receive comes directly from users who   register on the Site, use the Coupon Publishing Service or who otherwise   voluntarily provide information to us in connection with various   activities on the Site or Coupon Publishing Service. The information we   request at registration includes, without limitation, name, &nbsp;e-mail and   web address. We may also collect other types of information during   registration or in connection with your other activities on the Site,   such as demographic information (including, without limitation, your   age, occupation, and income) and information about or contained in   postings you make in forums or any other interactive areas of the Site,   your answers to surveys, your participation in sweepstakes, contests,   games and promotional offers; and in any email request you send us for   any reason (such as to request customer service or provide us with   comments or feedback). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        We   also automatically collect some information when you use the Site or   Coupon Publishing Service. We log your IP address. If you reached the   Site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, we also log   that information. This helps us understand our users' interests and   maximize our online exposure. All of this information is collected and   used only as aggregate information; that is, it is entered into our   database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on our users,   but not individual reports that identify you personally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        Framed Content &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        The   Coupon Button Content may be displayed on or through Third Party Sites   with the use of inline frames or other framing techniques. We may   collect personal information in such framed pages or content located on   or provided by Third Party Sites. When you submit personal information   to us in this manner, it is treated as personal information under this   Policy. The collection and use of personal information by the Third   Party Site directly (i.e., outside of the Coupon Button Content framed   pages) is governed separately by the privacy policy of such site. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        We   may use cookies to identify Site users and to customize their   experiences on the Site. Unless you provide your email address to us,   our cookies contain no personally identifiable information about you. If   you have provided your email address to us, however, our cookies may be   used to identify you. We use cookies to help us understand how visitors   use (and to help us to improve) the Site. You may refuse to accept   cookies from us by following the procedures specific to your Web   browser. If you do so, your browser may react strangely and you may not   be able to use some services on the Site. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Additionally,   we may use, and may allow third parties to use, Web beacons on the Site   and Coupon Publishing Service to monitor the effectiveness of   advertising or for other legitimate purposes. Web beacons, also known as   "Web bugs," are small, graphic images on Web pages or Web-based   documents or in email messages that allow us or third parties to monitor   who is visiting the Site or Coupon Publishing Service. Web beacons   collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to,   the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was   viewed. Web beacons may be linked to your personal information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        How We Use the Information We Collect &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
      We use the information we collect to:</p><br>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>contact you for administrative purposes or provide you with customer service;</li>
        <li>complete transactions requested by you or to verify that you have submitted a coupon to our Coupon Publishing Service;</li>
        <li>respond to any questions, problems or complaints, or request feedback;</li>
        <li>organize the Site and Coupon Publishing Service to better serve you and customize or develop our products and services; and</li>
        <li>send you emails containing information about products and services that you might find of interest.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      <br>
      
      Personal   information provided on our Site or through the Coupon Publishing   Service may be linked together or merged with other personal information   we obtain about you so that we may better understand your needs and   inform you about our products or services and those of our business   partners. In addition, if we receive personal information from third   parties with whom we have business relationships, we may combine this   information with the other personal information we maintain about you.   In either case, this Policy governs this information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Disclosure of Information &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      We   do not rent, sell or disclose personal information to third parties   without your prior consent, except as described in this privacy policy.   We may share personal information when we have your consent to do so,   when required by law, when required to protect our rights or property,   as necessary to complete a transaction you have requested, or for   marketing purposes. We reserve the right to use and disclose any   non-personal information that we collect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      We   may use third party service providers to assist us with the   administration of the Site or Coupon Publishing Service or to perform   other services for us, including transaction processing and sending   email. These third parties may be given or may have access to your   personal information, but agree to receive and use such information   solely to provide services to us or on our behalf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      If   you provide us with personal information through a Third Party Site, we   may share such information with such Third Party Site for their   internal business purposes and we generally require such Third Party   Sites to comply with this Policy. In addition, we may also share   personal information with third parties for such third parties' (or   other third parties') marketing purposes; however, we provide you with   the choice of opting-out of such disclosures (please see "Choice and   Access" below). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      We   may use third parties, called third-party ad servers or network   advertisers, to deliver ads to you on our behalf. These third-party ad   servers may use cookies, web beacons or other technology to collect   non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Site or   the Coupon Publishing Service in order to use it to present   advertisements that may be of interest to you. If you would like more   information about this practice or whether you can opt out of having   this information used by third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads,   please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Information   about our users, the Site and the Coupon Publishing Service is a   business asset of Justuno. Therefore, information about our users,   including personal information, will be disclosed as part of any (a)   merger or acquisition, (b) creation of a separate business to provide   the Site or our Coupon Publishing Service, or to provide other services   or fulfill products; (c) debt financing, sale or pledge of company   assets, or (d) insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal   information would be transferred as one of Justunos's business assets.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      We   may release personal information when we believe release is appropriate   to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court   order); to enforce or apply our policies or any other agreement with a   user; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to   protect our rights or property; to protect our users from fraudulent,   abusive, or unlawful use of our Site or its services; to enforce   contest, sweepstakes, promotions, or game rules; or if we reasonably   believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious   physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or   justifies disclosure of records without delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Choice and Access &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      We   provide our users with the ability to "opt-in" to receiving certain   communications from us or having their information disclosed to third   parties by indicating their preferences at the time of registration. If   such user later wishes to change these preferences or access, change or   delete their personal information we provide the following options: </p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>To   "opt-out" of receiving promotional e-mail from us, you can; (a) send an   email to help@Justuno.com with your request; or (b) click on the   "unsubscribe" field in your on line account management page.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
      Please   note that opting out of receiving communications from us will not   prevent you from receiving administrative communications, such as those   concerning the operation of the Site or Coupon Publishing Service or   about a review you have submitted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Children &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      We   do not intend, and the Site is not designed, to collect personal   information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years   old, you should not register with or otherwise provide personal   information to our Site or the Coupon Publishing Service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Security &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      We   use reasonable security measures in an effort to prevent loss, misuse   and alteration of information under our control. We cannot, however,   guarantee protection of all information against interception,   misappropriation, misuse, or alteration, or that your information may be   not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the   unauthorized acts of others. Furthermore, we have no control over the   security of other sites you might visit, interact with or do business   with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Information   you provide through the Site is protected by an encryption technology   called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to ensure privacy and security during   transmission. Your registration information is accessible online only   through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of   personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not   disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the   Site by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if   you believe your password has been misused or otherwise   misappropriated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Policy Changes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      We   will modify this Policy if our privacy practices materially change in   the future. We will notify you of such changes only by posting the new   policy on our Site and indicating at the top of the Policy the date it   was last updated. We encourage you to review the Policy each time you   visit our Site or Coupon Publishing Service to see if it has been   updated since your last visit to make sure you understand how personal   information you provide will be used. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
