	<div id="FieldContainer">
		<p>Judici knows that privacy is important and that you care how information about you is gathered and shared. This notice describes our privacy policy.</p>
		
		<p>We do not gather any personalized information on users searching the court public access portions of judici.com.</p>
		
		<p>Users who wish to access Judici premium services are required to subscribe. During the subscription process, we collect and store personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, phone number, address, and email address. We also collect credit card information to pay for premium services. For added privacy, we do not store your credit card numbers at Judici.com beyond the one month period required to help us reconcile our monthly merchant account . Each time you make a purchase from Judici you will have to re-enter your credit card information. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</p>
		
		<p>Initially, collected subscriber information is checked to validate your identity. From then on, your e-mail address is used as your user ID to verify that you are an authorized user of the Website. Corrections or updates to your contact information may be made at any time by accessing <a href="/user/preferences.jsp">Subscriber Preferences</a>. Your e-mail address will be used to notify you in the unlikely event of any suspected information breach to Judici involving your personal information.</p>
		
		<p>When we ask users provide such information, its transmission is encrypted and protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While on the subscription page, the lock icon on the bottom of your Web browser becomes locked. You can also identify the secure connection by looking at the URL, which will begin with https: (instead of http:).</p>
		
		<p>According to FCRA rules, Judici is required to maintain a log of multi-court searches performed by subscribers for at least two years.</p>
		
		<p>Judici does not sell, rent, distribute or disclose your personally identifiable information collected at subscription to any third parties; provided however, that Judici reserves the right to disclose such information as may be required by law or court order.</p>
