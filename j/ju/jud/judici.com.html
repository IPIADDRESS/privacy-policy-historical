							</li>
							<li style="text-align: justify">
								<span>If you are an E-Pay User, Judici.com will also collect your plea (for example, guilty or not guilty), and data used to locate and process the case that you want to make a plea and/or payment for (collectively "E-Pay Case Data"), including for example the following information: driver's license number, date of birth, ticket number, zip code, and payment amount.

								<span>In addition, for all users of the Website, we collect the Internet protocol ("IP") address associated with the computer or Internet Service Provider you are using to visit the Website.

Session ID cookies ("Session ID Cookie") expire when you close your browser. A Session ID cookie is used by Judici.com to facilitate the proper functioning of the features of the Website. For example, it lets you easily return to your last search, lets Subscribers track the items in their shopping cart, and enables users to complete a multi-step process such as when E-Pay Users make an electronic plea or payment.</span>
