<p class="h1"> Privacy Policy for juliensauctions.com</p>

<p class="b"><br>
Effective as of December 14, 2004</p>

<p><b>(1)</b> We do not "harvest" email addresses from our website visitors or anyone else, nor do we send unsolicited 
commercial bulk email (spam) to our customers or website visitors.</p>

<p><b>(2)</b> <span class="b">Your Information</span>. Personal and/or business information provided to us by our 
website visitors, customers, clients and newsletter subscribers is treated confidentially and is not sold to anyone 
for any reason. If you provide such information to us by email, telephone, letter, an online form on our website 
or other means, we use that information only to provide you with our services and/or products or to respond to your 
requests.</p>

<p>Our online inquiry forms collect some or all of the following personally identifying information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Phone number or email address (at least one is required)</li>
<li>Website address</li>
</ul>

<p>None of the above personally-identifying information is stored on our website, and thus we provide no online 
process for individuals to review and request changes to any of their personally identifiable information collected 
through our website's online forms or sent by email to us.</p>

<p><b>(3) PayPal Shopping Cart/PayPal Accounts</b>. We utilize the PayPal shopping cart. PayPal accounts are initiated 
and maintained by users at the <a href="http://paypal.com/" target="_blank">PayPal website</a>, and are not subject 
to our access or control. When a customer places an order through the PayPal shopping cart, we receive notice by 
email from PayPal containing the following personally identifying information, which is not stored on our website 
nor shared with or sold to third parties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Street Address, City, State, Zip Code, Country</li>
<li>Email address</li>
</ul>

<p><b>(4)</b> <b>Web Hosting</b>. As with most web hosting companies, ours records and stores only the following 
information about our website visitors: the numerical IP address or domain name from which they access the Internet; 
the date and time our website is accessed; the pages you visited and whether they successfully downloaded to your 
browser; and sometimes the Internet address of the website from which you may have accessed our website (such as 
Google.com). We use this information only to understand how many visitors we get and how visitors use our website 
so that we can improve it. We do not sell this information to anyone for any reason. Simply surfing our website 
will not impart other personally-identifying information to us.</p>

<p><b>Notification of Changes to Privacy Policy</b>. In the event that we make changes to or update this Privacy 
Policy; in that event, we will post them to this page of our website with the corresponding Effective Date.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
