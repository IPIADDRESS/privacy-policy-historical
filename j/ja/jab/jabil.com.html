        BEFORE ACCESSING THIS WEB SITE, AND BEFORE SUBMITTING INFORMATION IN CONNECTION 
        WITH ANY APPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT. ACCESSING THIS WEB SITE OR SUBMITTING 
        EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION INDICATES THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 
        IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT ACCESS THIS WEB 
        SITE AND DO NOT SUBMIT ANY EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION. </p>
      <p class="content">To measure our visitors' interest in and use of various 
        areas of our Site, including any advertising, we may rely upon aggregate 
        information -- which is information that does not identify you. This information 
        may be gathered by so-called “cookies” or "clear GIF" 
        files. With this aggregate information, we may undertake or commission 
        statistical and other summary analyses of our visitors' behavior and characteristics. 
        Although we may share this aggregate information with third parties, rest 
        assured that no aggregate information we provide to third parties will 
        allow anyone to identify you, or determine anything personal about you.</p>
      <p class="content"><b>1. Employment Submissions; Use Of Personal Information<br>
        </b>Our web site (the “Site”) allows users to submit resumes 
        and other information for purposes of seeking employment with Jabil Circuit, 
        Inc., its affiliates and subsidiaries (“Jabil” or “we” 
        or “us”). By using our Site to submit this information, you 
        are authorizing us to use “personal information” contained in 
        your submission in the manner we deem necessary or advisable for purposes 
        of processing your request to be considered for employment. By "personal 
        information" we mean information that can be used by someone to identify 
        or contact you, such as your name, e-mail address, or mailing address. 
        In addition, if you provide us with references, and we decide to contact 
        such references, we may disclose personal information in connection with 
        such contacts. </p>
      <p class="content">In sum, we use personal information for the purposes 
        for which you provided the information. In addition, we may use this information 
        to notify you of new opportunities or other developments at Jabil. If 
        you do not wish to receive this additional information, please send an 
        e-mail to that effect to webmaster@jabil.com. </p>
      <p class="content"><b>2. Consideration of Employment Submissions. <br>
        </b>We have created the portion of our Site that allows submission of 
        employment applications in order to assist prospective applicants in submitting 
        applications, and to assist us in collecting these applications. Due to 
        the nature of the Internet and the structure of the Site, we may receive 
        substantially more applications than we wish to review, we may receive 
        applications which do not meet the requirements for positions that are 
        available, and we may receive applications at points where no positions 
        are currently available. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will 
        process or review materials you submit seeking employment with Jabil, 
        and we expressly disclaim any obligation to engage in such processing 
        or review. </p>
      <p class="content">Jabil believes that all applicants and employees are 
        entitled to equal employment opportunity. Each applicant and employee 
        is recruited, employed, evaluated, and considered for promotions without 
        regard to his or her race, color, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national 
        origin, age, marital status, mental or physical disability, veteran’s 
        status, or any other category protected by law. </p>
      <p class="content"><b>3. No Third Party Unassociated With Your Application 
        Is Given Access to Personal Information <br>
        </b>Except in connection with checking references you may provide to us, 
        we do not share with third parties any personal information you provide 
        to us. By "third parties" we mean anyone who is not involved 
        in running the Jabil Site, or in the processing, evaluation, or consideration 
        of your request to be considered for employment. </p>
      <p class="content"><b>4. Privacy Protection for Children <br>
        </b>Our Site is not directed at children, and we will not accept or request 
        personal information from individuals we know to be under 13. </p>
      <p class="content"><b>5. Exceptions <br>
        </b>There are two exceptions to our privacy policy. First, we may release 
        or use personal information in connection with legal proceedings or inquiries, 
        or in response to a subpoena or court order, or in connection with compliance 
        matters. Second, our policy only applies to information you provide to 
        us. You may provide third parties with information if you, for example, 
        choose to participate in an online discussion, or click on third-party 
        links we may provide at our Site. In addition, if we contact references 
        you provide in connection with your request for consideration of employment, 
        these references may learn certain of your personal information. We cannot 
        be responsible for the conduct of these third parties. They may have policies 
        or practices concerning privacy that differ substantially from ours, and 
        you may receive unsolicited messages or other contacts due to this conduct. 
      </p>
      <p class="content"><b>6. User Submissions; Evaluation And Content Of User 
        Submissions</b><br>
        All comments, submissions, employment material, or other information which 
        you may choose to provide to us in connection with your use of this Site 
        (collectively, “Submissions”) shall be and remain the property 
        of Jabil. Jabil shall be free to use, without restriction and without 
        compensation to you, any ideas, concepts, know-how, suggestions, or techniques

        subpoenas or court orders directing Jabil to disclose the identity of 
        users posting such information or materials, or otherwise directing compliance

        revoke or otherwise restrict the access privileges of any user that at 
        any time fails to comply with the restrictions contained in this Section. 
      </p>
      <p class="content"><b>7. Security of Information<br>
        </b>We have put in place security control systems designed to prevent 
        unauthorized disclosure of your personal information. We do not, however, 
        provide any assurances as to the security of your information, and expressly 
        disclaim any such obligations. </p>
      <p class="content"><b>8. Assignment <br>
        </b>In the event that Jabil may wish to assign or transfer your personal 
        information and its rights hereunder to a third party, you agree that 
        Jabil may do so, on the condition that such third party agrees to abide 
        by Jabil's applicable Terms and Conditions concerning privacy. </p>
      <p class="content"><b>9. Termination<br>
        </b>You may terminate your consideration for employment with us at any 
        time by withdrawing your request for employment consideration and refraining 
        from visiting our Site. We may terminate these Terms and Conditions and 
        immediately deny you access to the Site if, in our sole discretion, we 
        conclude that your activities, postings, or other conduct in connection 
        with the Site are inappropriate or in breach of these Terms and Conditions.
