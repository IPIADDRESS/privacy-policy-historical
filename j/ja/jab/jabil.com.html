Although Jabil US may share this aggregate information with third parties, no aggregate information Jabil US provides to third parties will allow such third parties to identify a Site Visitor, or determine anything personal about the Site Visitor.<br><span class="subHeadline">6.2.&nbsp;Personal Data from Site Visitors.&nbsp;</span> Jabil US may receive Personal Data from Site Visitors who use the Jabil Web Site, where applicable, (i) to submit questions or comments to Jabil US, (ii) to request information about products or services offered by Jabil US or Jabil Affiliates, or (iii) to employ other features that may be available at the Web Site which call for submission of Personal Data.&nbsp; Jabil US uses Personal Data which Site Visitors submit through the Jabil Web Site (a) to respond to the Site Visitor (although Jabil US in this Privacy Policy undertakes no obligation to respond to any Site Visitor), and (b) to provide the services or products requested by the Site Visitor, where the requested services or products are, in fact, offered by Jabil US and are in accordance with Jabil US's standard business procedures.&nbsp;

If Jabil US uses a Site Visitor's Personal Data for these additional Jabil-related purposes, such as for contacting the Site Visitor independent of an inquiry from the Site Visitor, the Site Visitor shall be entitled to opt-out of such additional uses in accordance with Section 11 (Choice and Opt-Out Rights).&nbsp; <br><span class="subHeadline">6.2.2.&nbsp;Disclosure.&nbsp; </span>Jabil US will not disclose Personal Data received from Site Visitors except in accordance with Section 12 (Onward Disclosures).<br><br><span class="subHeadline">7.&nbsp;Employment Applicants.&nbsp;

Applications submitted by Employment Applicants will include Personal Data.&nbsp; This Section provides Jabil US's Personal Data Protection Practices with respect to such Personal Data. <br><span class="subHeadline">7.1.&nbsp;Use of Employment Applicants' Personal Data.&nbsp;</span> Jabil US uses Personal Data it receives from Employment Applicants (i) to process the Applicants' applications, (ii) to contact references which may be identified in such applications, (iii) to collect and compile additional information concerning the Applicant from available sources, consistent with applicable law, and (iv) to evaluate the Employment Applicant's candidacy for employment.&nbsp; <br><span class="subHeadline">7.1.1.&nbsp;Further Uses.&nbsp; </span>Jabil US and US Affiliates may wish to use an Employment Applicant's Personal Data for purposes which are in addition to those specified in Section 7.1 (Use of Employment Applicant's Personal Data) and which do not involve disclosures beyond those permitted in Section 12 (Onward Disclosures).&nbsp;

<br><span class="subHeadline">8.3.&nbsp;Business Card Information</span>.&nbsp; Business Card Information (as defined below) is customarily freely exchanged, and generally does not qualify as Personal Data because it is publicly available, as set out in Section 21.15.&nbsp; Accordingly, Business Card Information is treated differently than Personal Data under this Privacy Policy, as set out below:&nbsp; <br><span class="subHeadline">8.3.1.&nbsp;Business Card Information</span>.&nbsp; Except in the case of merger or acquisition candidates and in other circumstances where additional information is advisable, in its uses of information from EU Business Contacts Jabil US and US Affiliates generally employ only that Personal Data (i) which identifies individual decision-makers at the relevant EU Business Contact, and (ii) which consists of such individual's business address, business email, and business telephone number (collectively "Business Card Information").&nbsp; <br><span class="subHeadline">8.3.2.&nbsp;Disclosing Business Card Information In Connection With Third Party Business Opportunities</span>.&nbsp; Jabil US and US Affiliates provide Business Card Information from EU Business Contracts to unaffiliated third parties where Jabil US and US Affiliates believe a business opportunity or other relevant opportunity is presented.<br>&nbsp;

Jabil US and US Affiliates will use the Personal Data of a Safe Harbor and Online Privacy Policy Data Subject for the purposes specified in Section 6 (Site Visitors), Section 7 (Employment Applicants), Section 8 (EU Business Contacts), and Section 9 (EU Consumers), above (collectively, "Original Purposes").&nbsp; Jabil US or US Affiliates may wish periodically to use such Personal Data for purposes other than the Original Purposes, including for purposes of providing the Data Subjects with direct marketing and other information.&nbsp; Information provided to a Data Subject for such purposes is referred to collectively as "Direct Marketing Information."&nbsp; <br><span class="subHeadline">11.1.&nbsp;Opt-Out Notice.</span>&nbsp; If a Safe Harbor and Online Privacy Policy Data Subject does not want to receive Direct Marketing Information from Jabil US, the Data Subject shall complete and execute the attached Opt Out Notice for Direct Marketing and mail it to Jabil US at the address indicated on the notice.&nbsp;
