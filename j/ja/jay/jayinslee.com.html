<p><br><b>How we use the information you provide :</b></p>

candidates we think you would like to hear from. If and only if you give
your consent, we will share basic contact information so they may contact

contribution online, we also ask for your credit card number and its
expiration date.</p>

<p>We make every effort to preserve user privacy.  When
required by law, we may disclose personal information wherein we have a
good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an
appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a
court order or legal process served on our Web
site.</p>
