<p><span style="color: #999999;">Jackbox Games is serious about protecting the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy sets forth how Jackbox Games, Inc., its related companies and affiliates (collectively, “Jackbox Games,” “we,” or “us”) will collect, use and share information in connection with your use of any Jackbox Games game or application (including, but not limited to, You Don’t Know Jack®) provided by Jackbox Games on the Internet, through a mobile device, or on other platforms (collectively, the “Service”). By accepting our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service Agreement, or by otherwise using or accessing any Jackbox Games Service, you consent to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Jackbox Games reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or revise this Privacy Policy at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Any such change or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Service, and your continued use of the Service after any changes or modifications to this Privacy Policy are posted will constitute your acceptance of, and agreement to, such changes or modifications. If you object to any change or modification, your sole recourse shall be to cease using the Service.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">If you access our Service from a third party Social Networking Site (“SNS”), such as Facebook or Google+, you may be required to also read and accept the terms of service and privacy policy of that SNS.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We may collect both Personal and Non-Personal Information. Personal Information is defined as information about you that can be used to contact or identify you such as your name, e-mail address, home address, or telephone number. Personal Information does not include aggregate information, which is data we collect about the characteristics and activities of users of the Service, from which any Personal Information has been removed. Non-Personal Information does not identify you personally and can include age, gender, or interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(a) Information About You Received From an SNS</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">When you use the Service through a SNS, you are allowing Jackbox Games access to the Personal Information you have provided to that SNS. The information shared varies from site to site and is also controlled by the privacy settings you established at the SNS. The information we collect when you access the Service on an SNS may include: your first and last name, your user ID, the user IDs of your friends, your profile picture, your locale, city, state and country, your e-mail address, your gender and your birthdate. By using the Service through an SNS, you are authorizing Jellyvision to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the SNS could provide to Jellyvision.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(b) Information You Give Us Directly</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">When you interact with the Service (whether or not on an SNS), we may collect, store, and use information that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, we may allow you to register with us by using Facebook Connect or other SNS authentication options to create an account or profile within the Service. We may also provide a more typical registration flow where you may be required to provide certain identifying information, such as your name, address, age, e-mail address, a password and other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account. In addition, you may voluntarily submit personal information when you, for example, make a purchase, sign up for newsletters, send us feedback, or post on our Facebook fan page.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We may also offer you the ability to import your address book contacts or manually enter e-mail addresses so that you can locate your contacts on the Service and invite those contacts to join you on the Service.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(c) Information About Your Play and Interaction With Other Players</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We may collect information about how you use the Service and interact with other users of the Service to analyze user behavior in our games. For example, we may collect user information to determine a user’s average score, how often a user plays a particular game, activates certain features of the game, purchases premium content, and other Service-related events.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We may also collect, store, and use information that you provide through the social networking features available through the Service. But you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information on bulletin boards or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other Internet users. We do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(d) Payment Information</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We use third parties, including but not limited to Facebook (for Facebook Credits) or Apple (for purchases on iOS devices), to manage the purchase of virtual currency and virtual items offered by the Service. Therefore, we do not have access to (and thus do not collect or store) your credit card details or billing information. You acknowledge and agree that Jellyvision will have no liability for or control over such third party company’s use or protection of your payment information. You should check the privacy policy of the independent third party company‘s website to determine how it will handle any payment information it collects from you and/or processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Please note, however, that we may collect, store, and use non-payment information relating to your purchase history, such as the products you have purchased and the frequency of those purchases.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(e) Technical Usage Information and Cookies</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Log Data and Mobile Devices. When you use the Service, our servers record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data“). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to the Service, pages of the websites involved in the Service that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for, access times and dates, and other information. If you access the Service from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device, such as your device type, geo-location, and operating system.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Cookies and Local Storage. We may also use cookies and other tracking technologies (including but not limited to browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash technology), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. These technologies may be used to collect and store information about your usage of Service, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen. Information contained in a cookie may also be linked to your Personal Information for purposes such as improving the quality of the Service, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use. You can disable cookies at any time, although, if you do so, you may not be able to access or use the Service or certain of its features.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(f) Customer Support Information</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">When you ask for assistance from our customer support team, we will collect and store the contact information you provide (generally your name and e-mail address), information about your game play or activity on the Service, and your user ID number. We will also store and use the correspondence and any information contained within.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(g) Third-Parties</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">To improve the quality of our services, we may supplement the information we collect with information we obtain from third parties. For example, we may collect information about you from other users who choose to upload their e-mail contacts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">2. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Jackbox Games does not share your Personal Information with third parties except as approved by you or as described below.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(a) To Provide and Manage the Service</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We use the information we collect from and about users to provide the Service and features to you, including to analyze and improve those services and features; to personalize your experience by delivering relevant content, advertising, and marketing messages; to allow you to comment on the Service, participate in contests, and promotions; to enable you to communicate and share with other users or services; and to provide you with customer support and respond to inquiries.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We may combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information and use this combination in an effort to improve your experience or to aggregate it with information collected from other users to improve or analyze our Service. This privacy policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information or of Non-Personal Information.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(b) To Allow Third-Parties to Assist Us In Providing and Managing the Service</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We may make your non-public Personal Information available to certain third party service providers, such as contractors, agents, or sponsors, who help us manage or provide the Service by, for example: developing or supporting products and features; conducting email marketing on our behalf; web-hosting; processing payments; administering message boards; fulfilling orders; processing data or statistics; or assisting with the administration, judging, and prize fulfillment aspects of contests and promotions. These outside service providers are required to protect non-public Personal Information entrusted to them and not use it for any other purpose than the specific services they are providing to Jellyvision.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(c) To Facilitate Communication Between Friends and Other Players</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">If you access the Service through an SNS, your SNS friends will see your name, profile, and descriptions of your game activity (e.g., high scores and achievements). This information may also be used to provide in-game leader boards and promote in-game player achievements to you and other players. In addition, friends and other players will be able to see your game profile, which may include your name or a “game name” and your profile photo, which in certain cases can reveal your SNS user ID.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Access to your SNS user ID may allow others to view the public information associated with your related SNS account. Other players may also be able to send you game requests or even friend requests through the related SNS’s communication channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(d) To Contact You</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We are committed to providing you with the best possible user experience and, therefore, one of the key uses of your personal information is to communicate with you. We may periodically contact you in connection with customer support inquiries, to alert you as to the status of your account(s), and to keep you informed of your in-game activity, including comments from friends and notifications about in-game status, achievements, and standings. Some messages, such as invites for friends to join you in a game, may include your name and profile photo. We may also contact you by e-mail for research purposes so that we can continually improve and update the Service based on your input.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We may also send promotional e-mail and SMS messages directly or in partnership with parties other than Jackbox Games to provide you with special offers and other services. If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from Jellyvision or its partners, follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each party’s e-mail. There are certain service notification e-mails that you may not opt-out of as long as you are registered with or subscribed to Service, such as notifications of changes to our Services or policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(e) To Deliver Relevant Advertising</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We may use the information you provide to us, and information we collect about your use of the Service through cookies and other technologies, to assist us in delivering you relevant ads when you use the Service. We may work with third party advertising networks and advertisers who help deliver these ads to you. We do not share your non-public Personal Information with these third parties, but we may share anonymized or aggregated information with them to improve the relevancy of the ads you see on the Service. As noted above, these third party advertising networks and advertisers may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track Non-Personal Information such as demographic information, aggregated information, and Internet activity to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(f) Legal Matters; Safety</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We may, without your consent, access and disclose your information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you or your account as may be permitted or required by law (including, but not limited to, court order or subpoena), or to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service Agreement or this Privacy Policy, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose your information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">(g) Sale or Transfer of Assets</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">If Jellyvision sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, Jackbox Games may transfer your Personal Information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">3. POLICY REGARDING CHILDREN</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">As set forth in our Terms of Service Agreement, the Service is not intended for children under the age of 14, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 14 years of age. In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 14, we will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from our records.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">4. USER CONTROL AND RETENTION OF DATA</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">If you have created an account with us directly (not through an SNS), you may access and change your account information by visiting your account page and making the desired changes. To manage the information we receive about you from an SNS, you will need to follow the instructions at that site for updating your information and changing your privacy settings. Once we receive your information from an SNS, that information is stored and used by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">If you created an account with us directly (not through an SNS), you may cancel the Service and close your account at any time. If you access the Service through an SNS, you may cancel the Service by removing the relevant Service application (such as the You Don’t Know Jack® Facebook application) from your SNS account. Remember that even after you cancel the Service, copies of some information that is publicly viewable may remain viewable in circumstances where, for example, your information has been posted on leader boards, you have commented on content on the Service or if another person copied, stored, or shared your information. As a matter of clarity, deactivation of an account is not immediate.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">If you deactivate your account or remove the Service, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical, gameplay, and recordkeeping purposes and integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce our Terms or other policies, take actions we deem necessary due to technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of the Service. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties’ policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">5. SECURITY</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">We have put in place reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. However, we do not guarantee, and explicitly disclaim any implied representation, warranty, or other promise, that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or use your Personal Information for improper purposes. Also please note that e-mail and messaging systems are not considered secure, so we discourage you from sending us Personal Information through these mediums.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">6. THIRD PARTIES</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Our Service may contain advertisements from companies other than Jackbox Games that may link to their own websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. If you have any questions about how these other websites use your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">7. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Under California law, California residents who have an established business relationship with us may choose to opt out of the disclosure of personal information about them to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. As stated above, our policy is not to disclose personal information collected online to a third party for direct marketing purposes without your approval. If you choose to opt-out at any time after granting approval, email gamessupport@jellyvision.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">8. INTERNATIONAL USERS</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">If you are using the Service from outside the United States, by providing your information on the Service, you are consenting to the transfer of your information to the United States for processing and maintenance in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service Agreement. You are also consenting to the application of United States law in all matters concerning the Service.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">9. CONTACTING US</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or the practices of Jackbox Games’ Service, please contact us at gamessupport@jellyvision.com or write to us at:</span></p>
