<p>


Jacksonville.com is committed to protecting consumer privacy online. We believe
that greater protection of personal privacy on the Web will not only
protect consumers, but also increase consumer confidence and ultimately
their participation in online activities. At Jacksonville.com, we intend to give
you as much control as possible over your personal information.</p><p>

The purpose of our policy is to inform you about the types of information
we gather about you when you visit our site(s), how we may use that
information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have
regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information.</p><p>

Our site(s) may contain links to other Web sites, including Web sites
directed to children. We have no control over the privacy practices or the
content of any of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other
sites to which we provide links from our sites. You should check the
applicable privacy policy of the Web site sponsor when linking to other Web
sites.</p><p>

<b>I. Information Which We Collect</b></p><p>

We may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information,
including your e-mail address, postal address, home or work telephone
number, credit card number (only if you choose to purchase a product
online), for purposes such as correspondence, making a purchase, or
participating in online contests, surveys or games. If you choose to give
us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners
may need -- to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with a
subscription, for example -- it is our intent to let you know how we will
use such information.</p><p>

Like many other commercial sites, our site(s) may utilize a standard
technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is
used. Cookies were designed to help a Web site recognize a user's browser
as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may
have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot
retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus, or
capture your e-mail address. Our Web site(s) may use cookies to enhance
your visit. Cookies can securely store a user's password, personalize home
pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of
selections, such as those selected in a "shopping cart." Our cookies may
collect your domain name and track your selections through our Web pages.
We only use "cookies" to gather the information indicated in this policy
and do not use cookies to gather personal identifying information about you
without your consent.</p><p>

We also may use cookies in connection with our chat rooms in order to
record your preferences. These cookies store automatically information
pertaining to the last chat room you visited, as well as certain comments
that can be issues in the chat room, in order to facilitate your experience
with the chat rooms. No additional identifying information is stored on
these cookies. You also have the option of choosing to allow us to use a
cookie to store your username, or "handle" and password on your computer
for use in that chat rooms, forums and other sites as indicated on the
particular site.</p><p>

We may require you to supply us with personal information (demographic
information such as average age, income, education, population data, zip
codes) during a "registration" process online prior to using certain
features of our site. For example, you may be required to register to use
chat rooms, forums, to access archival stories, to subscribe to our member
newspapers, subscribe to an e-mail version of our site, and to access other
features. We use this general information to aggregate information
according to demographics, such as gender, geographic location, age, income
or a combination of these or other demographics.</p><p>

<b>II. Use of User Information</b></p><p>

We may perform statistical analyses of aggregate user behavior. This allows
us to measure relative consumer interest in the various areas of our Web
sites for product development purposes. Any information we collect is used
for its own internal purposes to improve the content of the Web sites, to
enhance users' experiences when visiting our site(s), to customize the
content and/or layout of our pages, and to provide the services required by
an individual user. We do not use personal identifying information for any
reason that is not disclosed either in this Policy or at the time the
information is requested. We never send e-mail to you unless you request a
particular service, or consent to being contacted by e-mail. There are
instances where you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an e-mail
list that will send information about the site or our advertisers to your
e-mail address, but this will be done only with your permission and consent.</p><p>

<b>III. Disclosure to Third Parties</b></p><p>

We do not share personal identifying information with any third party
without your permission. We disclose only in aggregate form our statistical
analyses or demographics of users to third parties, such as advertisers or
other business partners. In some instances, we operate shared Web sites
with businesses affiliated with us. Our privacy policy will apply to these
Web sites, and our affiliates adhere to our privacy policy and will not
share personal information with any third party without your permission.
PLEASE BE AWARE that when you voluntarily disclose personal information
(such as your name, e-mail address) in chat areas or bulletin boards to
third parties, that information may be collected by others outside the
control of us and may result in unsolicited messages from others.</p><p>

<b>IV. Accuracy of User Information</b></p><p>

In order to ensure the accuracy of personal information provided for
registration, you may return to the registration form online in order to
change information you have provided at any time. Questions regarding our
privacy policy, the accuracy of your personal information or the use of the
information collected should be directed via e-mail to <a href="mailto:jaxstaff@jacksonville.com">jaxstaff@jacksonville.com</a>, or you

right to change this policy at any time, and will post any changes to this
policy as soon as they go into effect.</p><p>

<b>V. Security of Information</b></p><p>

We use our best efforts to ensure the security of personal information
submitted by users. When collecting credit card information for online
purchases, we offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your
information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing
it. When we collect other information from our users, it is stored in an
area where the general public does not have access to it.</p><p>
