				<br>
				<p>
					We may collect personally identifiable information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our Site, register for an Account, place an order, subscribe to a newsletter, or otherwise choose to provide personally identifiable information.

				<p>
					Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personally identifiable information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to Us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that this may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities, creating or accessing an Account, or doing business with us if they do not provide the information that We need.</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="section-subheading">
					<strong>Non-personally identifiable information</strong></h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about Users whenever they interact with our Site and/or register for an Account on the Affiliate Network. Non-personally identifiable information may include the name and version of the browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.), the type of computer or device you are using (e.g., PC, Mac, mobile phone, etc.), the operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, Android), the domain name of your service provider (e.g., Telstra, Optus, etc.) and other technical information about Users' means of connection to our Site.

				<p>
					Most browsers are set to accept cookies. You may choose to set your web browser to block cookies or to alert You when cookies are being sent. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. If you change computers, operating systems or browsers, or use multiple computers or browsers, you will need to repeat this process for each computer and each browser.

				<p>
					Accounts are password-protected so that only You and JackMedia have access to this personal information. You may edit your registration data by using your password.</p>
				<p>
					When our Account registration process requests Sensitive Information (such as bank account information and/or credit card information), and when we transmit such Sensitive Information, that Sensitive Information is encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software. While we use SSL encryption to protect Sensitive Information online, we protect all other user information online and offline. The Third Party Agent servers that we utilise to store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure physical environment. The Third Party Agent has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of personally identifiable information stored on its servers.</p>

					Please be advised that, although we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data on or through our Site is at your own risk. However, access to your personally identifiable information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. Only employees, and Third Party Agents, that need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all User information. Employees not adhering to our written firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable laws, We shall notify You and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that We learn of an information security breach with respect to your personally identifiable information. Where possible, You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>
				<p>
					You acknowledge that you provide your personally identifiable information to us with knowledgeable consent and at your own risk.</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="section-subheading">
					<strong>Data retention</strong></h3>
