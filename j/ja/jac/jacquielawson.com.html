<h1><br>Our Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>Name and address data</h3>
<p>When you join jacquielawson.com you are invited to provide us with your e-mail address, 
name, address, telephone number and country of origin.  All this information is optional
except your e-mail address (which we use to identify you when you log on) and your
country (which we have to know in order to determine whether to account for Value Added
Tax on your membership fee).</p>
<p>We will not divulge any of this information to any third party now or at any time in
the future without first asking for your permission.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>When you log on, our server looks up your membership number on our database and sends
it to your computer in the form of a "cookie".  This cookie is used by our software simply
for the purpose of detecting that you have logged on and are authorised to send cards and
visit any member-only parts of the site.  The cookie is a "session" (as opposed to "permanent")
cookie, and when you exit your browser session this cookie is automatically deleted (which 
is why you have to log on again every time you revisit the site).</p>
<h3>Card History</h3>
<p>As a necessary part of the process of sending e-cards, the recipient details and personal
messages which you enter when you send a card are stored in our database.  This also enables
you to review cards you have sent by using our Card History page.</p>
<p>We will not divulge these details to any third party.</p>
<h3>Analysis of data</h3>
<p>We may use the information collected on the site (principally membership information, 
history of cards sent, and information submitted by you using our feedback form) to improve 
our service.  For example, if we find that many people are sending a particular type of card, 
we may decide to develop more cards of that type.  Any information gained in this way
will not be shared with any third party.</p>
