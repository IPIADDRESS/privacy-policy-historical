        <h3 id="a">A. Information Collected by Jackson Hewitt</h3>      
        <h6 id="a1">1. Voluntary Registration</h6>      
        <p>We collect personal information (which may include, without limitation, your name, email address, social security number,         date of birth, credit card information, mailing address and/or telephone number) from you when you voluntarily register
                    on the Website or when you request information or a service (e.g., tax preparation services) on the Website. [In order         to create an account on our Website and administer that account, we will also collect a username and password which you
                    will then use to access your account and other information.]</p>      
        <h6 id="a2">2. Surveys or Contests</h6>      
        <p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our sites. If you participate,         we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely
                    voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically         includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>      
        <h6 id="a3">3. Log Files</h6>      
        <p>As is true of most web sites, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies to gather certain         information automatically and store it in log files whenever you visit or interact with the Website. This information         may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating
                    system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other         information we collect about you. This information may be non-identifying or it may be associated with you. Whenever
                    we associate this information with your personal information, we will treat it as personal information. We do this to         improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.</p>      
        <h6 id="a4">4. Tracking Technologies</h6>      
        <p>Jackson Hewitt and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’         movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole (“Tracking Technologies”).
                    These Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device.</p>      
        <p>A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later         developed):</p>        
        <p><strong><em>Cookies.</em></strong>  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Website.  A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device.  HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.  Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in.  Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.  Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.  Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies.  For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s web site www.adobe.com.  Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Website may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Website your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>        
                
        <p><strong><em>Web Beacons.  </em></strong>Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Website’s pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Website, to monitor how users navigate the Website, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. </p>        
                
        <p><strong><em>Embedded Scripts.</em></strong>  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Website, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>        
                
        <p><strong><em>Browser Fingerprinting.</em></strong>  Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.</p>                 
        <p><strong><em>ETag, or entity tag.</em></strong>  A feature of the cache in browsers.  It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.  If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.  Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier.  ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash and/or HTML5 cookies.</p>        
                
        <p><strong><em>Recognition Technologies.  </em></strong>Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user).</p>        
                
        <p>There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Website.  Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Website, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.  We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them.  However, you consent to potentially encountering third-party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Website and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.</p>        
              
        <h6 id="a5">5. Behavioral Targeting / Re-targeting</h6>             
        <p>We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by visiting 
            <a href="http://preferences.truste.com">http://preferences.truste.com</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>             
        <h6 id="a6">6. Information from Third Parties</h6>      
        <p>We may receive information about you from other individuals that use the Website.  [Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Website with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you.]  To the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Website, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise.  In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.</p>      
              
        <h6 id="a7">7. California Do-Not-Track Disclosures</h6>      
        <p>Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., browser do-not-track signals).  Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.</p>      
              
        <h3 id="b">B. How Jackson Hewitt May Use Collected Information</h3>

Section 7216 of the Internal Revenue Code requires that we obtain your consent (Opt in) to the disclosure and use of information you provide us in connection with your tax return information. We will not disclose or use your tax return information for any purpose other than preparing, assisting in preparing, or obtaining or providing services in connection with the preparation of your tax return unless you authorize us to do so, except when expressly required or authorized by law, necessary to the preparation of the tax return, or pursuant to court order. See Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information Consent form and Consent to Use of Tax Return Information Consent form. We may use or disclose your personally identifiable information as described below or where you have provided consent under §7216, or as otherwise permitted by applicable laws.</p>      
        <ul class="list-unstyled color-jh1-bullets">        
            <li>At the time of tax preparation, we will further explain how we handle your tax return information. We may use or disclose personally identifiable information about you to the following types of third parties: Financial service providers; non-financial companies, such as retailers and direct marketers; and others.</li>        
            <li>If you apply for a product or service, we will ask you to authorize us to disclose your tax return information to the financial institution providing such product or service.

            <li>We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, legal process, process, or other judicial, administrative, or investigative proceeding, or where we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is required by law.  We also may disclose such information in the vent of the sale or dissolution (bankruptcy) of assets, in whole or in part, of our business or any of its affiliates.  We also may disclose such information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or for other purposes permitted or required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>        
                  </ul>

        <p>Jackson Hewitt may disclose the personal information you provide to us to our business partners, sponsors or affiliates so they can assist us in providing the services you request. By requesting information from our business partners, sponsors, and affiliates through the Websites, you give us permission to transfer your personal information to them so they can fulfill your request.  We may also share non-personal information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties.</p>

        <p>The IRS requires a Device ID as part of the electronic filing record to aid in their defense against fraudulent return filing. Device ID identifies the device (e.g., computer, tablet, phone or other device) used to create the tax return. Our software system is recording this ID during the preparation of your tax return and will provide it to the IRS (and states) when your tax return is filed electronically.</p>      
        <h6 id="c1">1. Linked Third Party Websites</h6>      
        <p>The Websites may contain links to other affiliated websites or websites of interest that are not under our direction or control (“Linked Third Parties”). Such links are included as a convenience.  Linked Third Parties may include social networking websites and websites of advertisers, sponsors and partners that may contain our or our affiliates’ logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data, or solicit information. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information you may provide while visiting Linked Third Parties. This privacy policy does not apply to Linked Third Parties and only applies to our Websites. You should exercise caution and review the privacy policy of any Linked Third Parties you are visiting.</p>      
              
        <p>We are not responsible for, and cannot control, the information practices of Linked Third Party websites.

        <h3 id="d">D. Security</h3>      
        <p>The security of all information associated with our Website visitors is important to us. We exercise considerable care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers or those of our business partners.</p>      
        <p>When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number,) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link:         
            <a title="https://www.entrust.net/customer/profile.cfm?domain=www.jacksonhewitt.com" href="https://www.entrust.net/customer/profile.cfm?domain=www.jacksonhewitt.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.entrust.net/customer/profile.cfm?domain=www.jacksonhewitt.com</a>.</p>      
        <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at 
            <a title="Link To: https://JacksonHewitt.custhelp.com/app/ask" href="https://JacksonHewitt.custhelp.com/app/ask" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://JacksonHewitt.custhelp.com/app/ask</a>.</p>             
        <h6 id="d1">1. Data encryption.</h6>      
        <p>Data encryption is the process of transforming legible information into a complex arrangement of illegible information. SSL uses a private/public key combination to encrypt data when it is sent and to decrypt data when it is received. SSL encrypts data using a mathematical formula, also referred to as a "key." Encryption strength is measured by the length of the key used to encrypt the data; the longer the key, the more effective the encryption. Using the SSL protocol, data transmission between you and our web server is performed at a standard level of encryption strength.   Your information is kept on your local computer or device as you enter information into our Website’s data collection fields.  When you click the “submit” button or similar feature, that information is transmitted across the Internet, via SSL, to our secured web servers. </p>      
        <h6 id="d2">2. Web server authentication. </h6>      
        <p>An SSL certificate is issued to ensure authentic and accurate identification of a secured web server. This translates into a digital ID, an electronic fingerprint, which is included in the key used to encrypt the data. Only our web server, in this case, is able to decrypt the data that you transmit because it is the intended (and digitally certified) secured web server for this data transmission.</p>      
        <h3 id="e">E. CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>      
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits Jackson Hewitt customers who are California residents who have supplied personal information (as defined in the law) to us, under certain circumstances, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If this law applies to you, you may obtain the categories of personal information shared by us and the names and addresses of all third parties that received personal information for their direct marketing purposes from us during the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2016 will receive information about 2015 sharing activities).  To make such a request, please provide sufficient information for us to determine if this law applies to you, attest to the fact that you are a California resident, and provide a current California address for our response.  Please send us an email by completing the form at 
            <a href="https://jacksonhewitt.custhelp.com/app/ask" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://jacksonhewitt.custhelp.com/app/ask</a> or by calling 1-877-476-3353. You must include your full name, email address, and postal address in your request.</p>             
        <p>In addition, we will not disclose your personal or financial information with any non-affiliated third party unless you have provided your consent to do so.</p>
