It also describes your choices regarding the use, access, and collection of your personal information.</p>
<p><b>Jackson Hewitt offers individual tax preparation services and related products and services, including in certain markets, tax debt resolution services, through various affiliates, franchisees and company-owned stores. Because we offer in-store and online tax preparation services, our privacy policies will vary depending on how you interact with Jackson Hewitt. This Privacy Policy applies solely to our Website, independent of any business relationship you may have with us</b>. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of our Website (unless otherwise stated below).</p>
<p><b>This Privacy Policy may change and will be updated on our Website. Changes are made when necessary to maintain the security, effectiveness, and appropriateness of our privacy and data security policies and practices, and to reflect the on-going changes in our industry. You should check this page periodically to ensure that you are in agreement with any changes.

<h3>A. Information Collected by Jackson Hewitt</h3>
<ol class="py-3" style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>
<h4>1. Voluntary Registration</h4>
<p>We collect personal information (which may include, without limitation, your name, email address, social security number, date of birth, credit card information, mailing address and/or telephone number) from you when you voluntarily register on the Website or when you request information or a service (e.g., tax preparation services) on the Website. Additional information may be gathered during your subsequent use of the site, or when we communicate with you via telephone, email or other means. This personal information may include, without limitation, your employment and income information, your bank account information, credit scores and credit history, and tax return information and associated IRS filings. In order to create an account on our Website and administer that account, we will also collect a username and password which you will then use to access your account and other information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>2. Surveys or Contests</h4>
<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Websites. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>3. Passive Collection</h4>
<p>As is true of most websites, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies to gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our Website (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the Website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>4. Tracking Technologies</h4>
<p>Jackson Hewitt and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users’ movements around the Website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole (“Tracking Technologies”). These Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your device. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our Website or service.</p>
<p>A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>
<p><b>Cookies</b>. A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Website. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website at http://www.adobe.com. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your device, some parts of our Website may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Website your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>
<p><b>Web Beacons</b>. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Website’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Website, to monitor how users navigate the Website, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<p><b>Embedded Scripts</b>. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Website, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p><b>Browser Fingerprinting</b>.
