<h3>A. Information Collected by Jackson Hewitt</h3>
<h6>1. Voluntary Registration</h6>
<p>We collect personal information (which may include, without limitation, your name, email address, social security number, date of birth, credit card information, mailing address and/or telephone number) from you when you voluntarily register on the Website or when you request information or a service (e.g., tax preparation services) on the Website. In order to create an account on our Website and administer that account, we will also collect a username and password which you will then use to access your account and other information.</p>
<h6>2. Surveys or Contests</h6>
<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our websites. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>
<h6>3. Passive Collection</h6>
<p>As is true of most websites, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies to gather certain information automatically and store it in log files whenever you visit or interact with the Website. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our website (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the website.</p>
<h6>4. Tracking Technologies</h6>
<p>Jackson Hewitt and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole (“Tracking Technologies”). These Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or fuctions on our website or service.</p>
<p>A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>
<p><em><b>Cookies.</b></em>&nbsp;A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Website. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website www.adobe.com. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Website may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Website your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>
<p><em><b>Web Beacons.</b></em><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Website’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Website, to monitor how users navigate the Website, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<p><em><b>Embedded Scripts.</b></em>&nbsp;An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Website, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p><em><b>Browser Fingerprinting.</b></em>&nbsp;Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.</p>
<p><em><b>ETag, or entity tag.</b></em>&nbsp;A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier.

    <a href="https://jacksonhewitt.custhelp.com/app/ask">https://jacksonhewitt.custhelp.com/app/ask</a>&nbsp;or call 1-877-476-3353.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>Our use or disclosure of your information whether collected by us, uploaded by you, or otherwise provided to us, may be limited by §7216 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999, and certain other laws, as well as our policies. Section 7216 of the Internal Revenue Code requires that we obtain your consent (Opt in) to the disclosure and use of information you provide us in connection with your tax return information. We will not disclose or use your tax return information for any purpose other than preparing, assisting in preparing, or obtaining or providing services in connection with the preparation of your tax return unless you authorize us to do so, except when expressly required or authorized by law, necessary to the preparation of the tax return, or pursuant to court order. See Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information Consent form and Consent to Use of Tax Return Information Consent form. We may use or disclose your personally identifiable information as described below or where you have provided consent under §7216, or as otherwise permitted by applicable laws.</p>
<ul type="disc">         
    <li>At the time of tax preparation, we will further explain how we handle your tax return information. We may use or disclose personally identifiable information about you to the following types of third parties: Financial service providers; non-financial companies, such as retailers and direct marketers; and others.</li>    
        
    <li>If you apply for a product or service, we will ask you to authorize us to disclose your tax return information to the financial institution providing such product or service. We will provide you with a Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information within the tax interview. You should review the agreements and the privacy policies of the financial institution to understand how it may use and disclose your personal information.</li>    
        
    <li>We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, legal process, process, or other judicial, administrative, or investigative proceeding, or where we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is required by law. We also may disclose such information in the vent of the sale or dissolution (bankruptcy) of assets, in whole or in part, of our business or any of its affiliates.

<h3>C. How Collected Information May Be Shared with Third Parties</h3>
<p>Jackson Hewitt may disclose the personal information you provide to us to our service providers, business partners, sponsors or affiliates so they can assist us in providing the services you request. By requesting information from our business partners, sponsors, and affiliates through the Websites, you give us permission to transfer your personal information to them so they can fulfill your request. We may also share aggregated user statistics with third parties.</p>
<p>We may also disclose collected information in certain cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of our rights or property, visitors, or anyone else. We may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.</p>
<p>The IRS requires a Device ID as part of the electronic filing record to aid in their defense against fraudulent return filing. Device ID identifies the device (e.g., computer, tablet, phone or other device) used to create the tax return. Our software system is recording this ID during the preparation of your tax return and will provide it to the IRS (and states) when your tax return is filed electronically.</p>

</p>
<h3>D. Security</h3>
<p>The security of all information associated with our Website visitors is important to us. We exercise considerable care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers or those of our business partners.</p>
<p>When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number,) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link:&nbsp;     
        
    <a href="https://www.entrust.net/customer/profile.cfm?domain=www.jacksonhewitt.com" title="https://www.entrust.net/customer/profile.cfm?domain=www.jacksonhewitt.com">https://www.entrust.net/customer/profile.cfm?domain=www.jacksonhewitt.com</a>.</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us at&nbsp;

<h6>1. Data encryption.</h6>
<p>Data encryption is the process of transforming legible information into a complex arrangement of illegible information. SSL uses a private/public key combination to encrypt data when it is sent and to decrypt data when it is received. SSL encrypts data using a mathematical formula, also referred to as a "key." Encryption strength is measured by the length of the key used to encrypt the data; the longer the key, the more effective the encryption. Using the SSL protocol, data transmission between you and our web server is performed at a standard level of encryption strength. Your information is kept on your local computer or device as you enter information into our Website’s data collection fields. When you click the “submit” button or similar feature, that information is transmitted across the Internet, via SSL, to our secured web servers.</p>
<h6>2. Web server authentication.</h6>
<p>An SSL certificate is issued to ensure authentic and accurate identification of a secured web server. This translates into a digital ID, an electronic fingerprint, which is included in the key used to encrypt the data. Only our web server, in this case, is able to decrypt the data that you transmit because it is the intended (and digitally certified) secured web server for this data transmission.</p>
<h3>E. CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. You may choose to restrict Jackson Hewitt’s use of your personal information. Upon request, Jackson Hewitt will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If you have provided your personal information to Jackson Hewitt and subsequently decide to restrict the use of this information or if you believe that any personal information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, please contact us at&nbsp;
                 
    <a href="https://jacksonhewitt.custhelp.com/app/ask" title="https://JacksonHewitt.custhelp.com/app/ask">https://JacksonHewitt.custhelp.com/app/ask</a>&nbsp;or by calling 1-877-476-3353 to correct, update, amend, delete/remove your personal information. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons.</p>
