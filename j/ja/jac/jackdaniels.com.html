<p><strong>LAST UPDATED: 10 January, 2013</strong></p>    </div>
    
    <div class="main-content generic">
      <p>Welcome to our web site (the "Site"). This Site is administered by Brown-Forman Corporation ("BFC") in Louisville, Kentucky, USA. We are committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users who visit our Site. &nbsp;This Privacy Practices Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is intended to inform you of the ways in which this Site collects information for the BFC brand featured on the Site (the “Brand”), the uses for that information, and the ways in which we will protect any personal information you choose to provide us.</p>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>

<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Persons Under Legal Drinking Age Are Not Allowed</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	BFC maintains this Site for the use of individuals who are of legal age to consume alcoholic beverages under applicable law, and you must be of legal drinking age where you reside to access the Site or provide information to us. &nbsp;We do not solicit or knowingly collect personal information from persons under such legal drinking age, and we do not knowingly market our products or services to persons under such legal drinking age. <a href="http://www.centurycouncil.org" target="_blank">www.centurycouncil.org</a></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Information Voluntarily Provided by You</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	We may collect information that our visitors volunteer to us, including but not limited to name, date of birth, postal address, e-mail address, telephone numbers, cell phone numbers, gender, household information, consumption habits, product usage, attitudes and preferences regarding our products and other personal information (collectively, “Personal Information”). &nbsp;Any Personal Information you send us will be used for the purpose indicated on the Site or as stated in this policy.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Use of Personal Information</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This Personal Information will be held by BFC and may be used by BFC and its affiliated companies and their agents, partners, or licensees. &nbsp;We will not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute your Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties without your consent, except to the extent required by law, or as set out below:&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Agents and Service Providers. </strong>We sometimes contract with other companies and individuals to perform functions or services on our behalf. They may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but are restricted from using the Personal Information for purposes other than providing services for us.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Business Transfers.</strong> &nbsp;In the event that our business is transferred to or merged with another company or entity, your Personal Information may be transferred to another company or entity that is part of the business transfer or merger.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Legal Matters.</strong> We may preserve and disclose any Personal Information and any information about your use of this Site if we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) protect and defend the rights, property or safety of BFC, its affiliates, other users of this Site, or the public; (b) enforce the Site’s <a href="/terms-use">TERMS OF USE</a>; or (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties. We may also disclose information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.</li>
</ul>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The Personal Information we receive will be used in our marketing, promotion and advertising of the Brand. &nbsp;As a result of providing us with your contact information, we may contact you by sending you mailings or other communications (electronic or otherwise) regarding the Brand’s products, services, promotions, or upcoming events that we believe may be of interest to you. &nbsp;We may also ask you (or have a service provider ask on your behalf) to participate in a survey seeking information or opinions related to our category of products.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Cookies</strong></div>
<div>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Please read our Cookie Policy by <a href="http://www.brown-forman.com/cookiePolicy/english.html">clicking here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<strong>Pixel Tags</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	We and our service providers may also use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. &nbsp;A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with Cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. &nbsp;When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>E-mails to Friends.</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	In the event that we offer the functionality to permit you to send messages regarding Site-related content to a friend through the Site, you may provide us with your friend’s e-mail address so that we can facilitate your sending a message to your friend; provided, however, that we reserve the right to refuse to facilitate the message for any reason, including without limitation restrictions placed on this functionality by your jurisdiction or that of your friend. &nbsp;BFC may retain your friend’s email address but will use your friend’s address only as described in this Privacy Policy and will not send additional promotional messages to your friend unless your friend registers with us (or has registered previously). &nbsp;Please note that any personal data you provide in connection with your request to send messages to your friend may be disclosed to your friend.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	By using our send-to-a-friend functionality, you confirm that all friends you nominate to receive messages are of legal drinking age in the country where they reside and that they have consented to receiving the email(s) from this Site that you request us to send.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Promotions</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	We may have promotions or sweepstakes on our Site. &nbsp;When you enter a promotion or sweepstakes, we will ask for Personal Information about you. &nbsp;We will use this information for the purposes of administering the promotion or sweepstakes. We will also use and store this information for the purposes set forth under “Use of Personal Information” above unless you instruct us otherwise either through mechanisms provided with the entry form or by contacting us. &nbsp;Any additional uses for this information will be set forth in the Official Rules of the promotion.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Information Posted by Visitors</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	BFC may make available through the Site services such as message boards to which you are able to post information, photos, images and other materials. &nbsp;Please note that any information, photos, images or materials you disclose through such services or otherwise on the Site becomes public information, and may be available to visitors to the Site all over the world and to the general public. &nbsp;In addition, when you choose to make a posting on such services, certain personal data will be available for other users to view. &nbsp;We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose personal data, or any other information, on the Site. &nbsp;WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PERSONAL DATA YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH THE SITE.&nbsp;</div>

	<strong>Third-Party Websites</strong></div>
