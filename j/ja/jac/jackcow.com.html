<h3 class="worklet-title">Privacy Policy</h3>



<div class="static">

<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the Jackcow website (collectively, the "website" is located at www.Jackcow.com).</p>



<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Jackcow we have a few fundamental principles:</p>



<ul>
	<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>

	<li>We generally don't share your personal information with anyone except to aid the redemption of your Vouchers, comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>

	<li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>

	<li>The following explains what information we collect from you (the "User" or the "End User") and how we use that information</li>
.</ul>



<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR WEBSITE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, LEAVE THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS THE WEBSITE.</p>

 
<ol>
	<li><strong> Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</strong><br><br>

<p>We collect two types of information about our Website Users. They are Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>



<p>Personally Identifiable Information. We define Personally Identifiable Information as information that identifies a specific End User. When you perform certain activities on the Website, such as creating an account, purchasing a product or service from us or our partners, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums, requesting information about our services, taking part in a survey, entering a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us or our partners, submitting a review, sending us or our partners feedback, submitting an affiliate agreement, applying for a job vacancy, posting a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Website (collectively, "Identification Activities"), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. Should you decide to engage in an Identification Activity, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone number and date of birth. When you order products or services, we may also ask you to furnish us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or transaction related information. Subject to the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If the mandatory information for a particular activity is not provided upon request, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.</p>



<p>Refer Friends. If you decide to use our referral service or buy a deal for a friend, we will request for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email with the gift you bought for them or inviting him or her to visit the site.</p>



<p>To request that we remove this information from our database, your friend may contact us at support@Jackcow.com.</p>



<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and services to you, enhance the operation of the Website, administer sweepstakes and contests, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties. Aside from that, if you use our Website to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal information. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot, accomplish administrative tasks, get in touch with you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable Malaysian law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.</p>



<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We define Non-Personally Identifiable Information as information that does not identify a specific End User. Like many other Websites, the Website automatically collects certain non-identifiable information regarding Website users, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the Web Site, the Internet address of the Website from which you linked directly to the Website, the operating system you are using, the sections of the Web Site you visit, the Website pages accessed and information viewed, and the materials you post to or download from the Website. This non- identifiable information is used for our Website and system administration purposes as well as to improve the Website. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools such as Cookies.</p>



<p>We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to administer the Website, troubleshoot, analyze trends, gather general demographic data, and comply with relevant Malaysian law. We may share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our content, online advertising campaigns and programming.</p>

</li>



	<li><strong> Release of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br><br>

<p>We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personally Identifiable Information for marketing purposes with other parties except as provided below:</p>



<p>In general, Personally Identifiable Information you submit to us is used by us to provide you access to Jackcow, to improve Jackcow, to better tailor the features, performance, and support of Jackcow and to offer you additional information, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us, our partners or our advertisers at your request. Additionally, we do share your content preferences and other information with the social network with which you have connected to Jackcow, along with those companies and persons you have asked us to share your information with.</p>



<p>We may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to third-party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of Jackcow and to help us communicate with you. Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments), and providing customer service.</p>



<p>We may share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information (other than credit card information) with Merchants whose Deals you have purchased in order to aid redemption. If you do not want us to use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information collected about you in the manner identified in this Privacy Policy, you may not use Jackcow.
</p>


<p>We may remarket your information. Remarketing is a way for us to connect with users, based upon your previous interactions with the Jackcow Website. Third-party marketing vendors may be hired by Jackcow to perform remarketing services.</p>



<p>In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personally Identifiable Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer’s assets may continue to process your Personally Identifiable Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>



<p>We may share your information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website. You hereby consent to us sharing your Personally Identifiable Information under the circumstances described herein.</p>

</li>



	<li><p><strong> Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
We may disclose and/or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with our Partners, Affiliates and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information with "Third Party Advertisers" or "Third Party Advertising Companies".</p>

</li>




	<li><p><strong>Updating and Correcting Information</strong><br>
You may modify any of your Personally Identifiable Information by logging into your account and accessing the "my account" section of the Website, sending us an email at support@Jackcow.com or writing to us at 22-3, Jalan PJU 8/5G, Damansara Perdana, 47280 Petaling Jaya, Selangor. Please include your name, address and email address, and what information you would like to update when contacting us.</p>



<p>If you choose to store credit card information on the site, you may delete your credit card information at any time by going to the "my account" section of your profile</p>

.</li>




	<li><p><strong>User Choices on Collection and/or Use of Information</strong><br>

As discussed above, you can always opt not to provide information, although it may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.</p>



<p>As a condition of purchase of our products and services, we will send you Administrative and Promotional emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity and purchases as well as updates about our products and promotional offers. You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. “Administrative Emails” relate to a User’s activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User’s account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and services. In contrast to Administrative Emails, however, you do have a choice with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional Emails advertise our products and services, including exclusive sales and other offers, and/or the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. If you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us at support@Jackcow.com, by writing to us at the address contained herein, or by hitting the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any of our e- mails. When contacting us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what Promotional Emails you do not want to receive.</p>

</li>




	<li><p><strong>Data Tracking</strong><br>
Cookies. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Jackcow uses cookies to help Jackcow identify and track visitors, their usage of Jackcow website, and their website access preferences. Jackcow visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Jackcow’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Jackcow’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

</li>




	<li><p><strong>Security of Information</strong><br>
We work to keep our servers, applications and databases secure and free from unauthorized access and use, by using physical, administrative and technological measures to protection the information we maintain. Unfortunately, no one can guarantee 100% security. If you have particular security concerns about certain personal information, please do not transmit that information over the Internet.</p>

</li>




	<li><p><strong>Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites</strong><br>
This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you on www.Jackcow.com. Other websites that may be accessible through this Website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Therefore, if you link to any such website, we urge you review the website’s privacy policy as we cannot be responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.</p>

</li>


	<li><p><strong>Miscellaneous Privacy Issues</strong><br>
9. Children. Children under the age of 18 may not use the Website. Jackcow does not knowingly collect personal information from minor children. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide personal information on this Website without their permission.</p>

If you are logged into Jackcow and Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" your profiles will merge if the email addresses match.
