                              We may  collect information about your computer, including where available your IP  address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to  report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users’  browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. 
                              
					        
                          </p><p>For the same reason, we may  obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file  which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.

During the period you are online and surfing on our  Website cookies are sent between your computer and the server in order to be  able to link information, such as what language you have chosen, for example.  Session cookies allow you to carry information across pages of our Website and  avoid having to re-enter information. They are also used within registration to  allow you to access stored information. Session cookies are not permanently  stored on your computer, but disappear once you shut it down. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                              <li><u>Persistent Cookies</u>: The other type  of cookie we use is stored for a limited period on your computer and is  designed to save the log-in name of registered members.

                            <ul>
                              <li>To help us  recognise you as a unique visitor when you return to our website and to allow  us to tailor content or advertisements to match your preferred interests or to  avoid showing you the same adverts repeatedly.</li>
                            
                              <li>To compile  anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how people use our  site and to help us improve the structure of our website.</li>
                            
                              <li>To internally  identify you by account name, name, email address, user ID, currency and  location (geographic and computer ID/IP address)</li>
                            
                              <li>To differentiate  between users who are on the same network to enable us to correctly allocate winnings  to the appropriate account.</li>
                            
                              <li>Within research  surveys to ensure you are not invited to complete a questionnaire too often or  after you have already done so.</li>
                            </ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
                            <p>1.1 Third parties may also serve cookies via this Website. Please note that  our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These are  normally used for the following purposes: </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>To serve  advertisements on our site and track whether these advertisements are clicked  on by users.</li>
                           
                              <li>To control how  often you are shown a particular advertisement.</li>
                           
                              <li>To tailor content  to your preferences.</li>
                           
                              <li>To count the  number of anonymous users of our site.</li>
                           
                              <li>For website usage  analysis.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>1.2 Use of Web Beacons: </p>
