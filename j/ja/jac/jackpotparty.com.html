<h3><strong>Non-Personal Information, Cookies and Other Tracking  Technologies</strong>
</h3>
<p> We may  collect information about your computer, including where available your IP  address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to  report aggregate information to our advertisers.&nbsp; This is statistical data about our users’  browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. </p>
<p>For the same reason, we may  obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file  which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.

<h3>There are several different types  of cookies. We use two types of cookie: “session cookies” and “persistent  cookies”.</h3>
<ul>
  <li><u>Session Cookies</u>: One type is a so-called 'session  cookie'. During the period you are online and surfing on our Website cookies  are sent between your computer and the server in order to be able to link  information, such as what language you have chosen, for example. Session  cookies allow you to carry information across pages of our Website and avoid  having to re-enter information. They are also used within registration to allow  you to access stored information. Session cookies are not permanently stored on  your computer, but disappear once you shut it down. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><u>Persistent Cookies</u>: The other type of cookie we use is stored for a limited period on your  computer and is designed to save the log-in name of registered members. This is  a service designed to help registered members to log-in more speedily. This  cookie can only be read by our server. We use persistent cookies for the  following purposes:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>To help us recognise you as a unique  visitor when you return to our website and to allow us to tailor content or  advertisements to match your preferred interests or to avoid showing you the  same adverts repeatedly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>To compile anonymous, aggregated  statistics that allow us to understand how people use our site and to help us  improve the structure of our website.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>To internally identify you by account  name, name, email address, user ID, currency and location (geographic and  computer ID/IP address)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>To differentiate between users who are  on the same network to enable us to correctly allocate winnings to the  appropriate account.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Within research surveys to ensure you  are not invited to complete a questionnaire too often or after you have already  done so.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
  <li>To count the number of anonymous users  of our site.</li>

<ul>
  <li>For website usage analysis</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.2 Use of Web Beacons: </h3>
<p>Some of our Web pages may contain  electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes known as clear gifs) that  allow us to count users who have visited these pages.
