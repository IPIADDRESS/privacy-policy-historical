								Jackpot.com only collects Member personally identifiable information ("PII") that is volunteered by Members during the registration process or in response to specific information requests explicitly presented to Members. To register to become a Member, you will be requested to provide the following PII: first and last name, address, email address, telephone number, gender and date of birth. . You will also be asked to provide a password, which you will need to access various features offered on the site. In addition, during registration or at another time, you might be asked to provide other demographic and/or financial information and/or information concerning your physical characteristics. In order to allow Jackpot.com to comply with applicable legal reporting requirements, Members who win certain prizes on the Site may be requested to provide their social security number. However, Jackpot.com will otherwise never share this social security information other than as required by law for tax and reporting purposes. From time to time, Jackpot.com may also present opportunities for Members to voluntarily provide a limited amount of general demographic information about themselves, which may include their gender, birth date, marital status, education, occupation, and household income.
								<p><b>Use and Sharing of PII</b><br>
									Jackpot.com reserves the right to use Member PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided; (2) as disclosed at the time such information is provided; and (3) as disclosed in this Policy. However, Members should note that Jackpot.com may change this Policy at any time (See "Changes to this Policy," below), and that therefore Jackpot.com may in the future use Member PII for additional purposes not currently included in this Policy.</p>
								<p>When you register to become a Member of this Site, you are automatically registered to become a Member of all the other online properties in the Vendare Network (collectively, the "Network Sites") Accordingly, Jackpot.com may share Member PII with the Network Sites. For a list of the Network Sites, please see your Jackpot.com member profile, which you can view by <a href="/login/updateinfo.asp">clicking here</a>.</p>
								<p>Also, Jackpot.com may share Member PII (except for credit card information and social security number) with its partners, sponsors, advertisers, service providers and marketers lookup and reference services and any other entities that Jackpot.com believes are able to provide Members with special offers and opportunities. Note that although Jackpot.com advises everyone who receives Member PII from Jackpot.com to support this Policy, Jackpot.com has no control over such party's information handling practices and is not responsible for any failure of such party to adhere to this Policy.</p>
								<p>As provided in the Member Agreement, Members are required to provide their PII to Jackpot.com as a condition of Membership, and to understand and agree that Jackpot.com may share their PII with the Network Sites and unaffiliated third parties as provided in this Policy.

								<p>Additionally, Jackpot.com may share Member PII in aggregate, non-personal form, with select companies that wish to reach a particular Member target audience (e.g., registered female Members between the ages of 25-35, who have an average household income of over $50,000.00). This information will allow these entities to provide relevant offers to specific Members.</p>
								<p>Finally, Jackpot.com may disclose Member PII in order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries; (3) comply with valid legal process; and (4) protect the rights or property of Jackpot.com, the Network Sites or other Members of this Site.</p>

							<td width="585"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">Jackpot.com also collects certain non-personally identifiable information as more fully described below.
								<p><i>Cookies.</i> Jackpot.com uses "cookies" on the Site. Cookies are small pieces of information that Jackpot.com's server places on an individual's computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site. For example, Jackpot.com will place a cookie on a Member's computer when he/she initially registers with the Site. The next time that Member visits the Site, Jackpot.com's server will recognize the cookie (and the Member) and the Member may begin playing games on the Site without the need to sign in.</p>
								<p>While some Web browsers allow a Member to automatically reject all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to be placed on the Member's computer, disabling this feature may compromise the efficiency and added services that cookies provide. It is not Jackpot.com's intention to use cookies to retrieve information that is unrelated to this Site or your interaction with this Site.</p>
								<p><i>IP Address.</i> Jackpot.com collects your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with Jackpot.com's server, and to administer this Site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.</p>
								<p><i>Clear GIFs.</i> Jackpot.com uses a common technology known as a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1 Pixel" on the Site and in e-mail communications with Members. A Clear GIF, or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that Jackpot.com (or a partner of Jackpot.com) places on a page of the Site. Jackpot.com may also occasionally place GIFs in e-mail messages that it sends to Members. GIFs, which do not contain any PII, provide Jackpot.com with important information about how Members use the Site and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, Jackpot.com is better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative e-mail presentations. Jackpot.com may also allow its advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track Members who link from their respective sites to this Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to Member PII.</p>
								<p>Although the information collected through the foregoing methods does not itself contain any PII, Jackpot.com may analyze and match such information with other information that you provide on this Site (including PII) as well as information that Jackpot.com may obtain elsewhere, and Jackpot.com may share all or some of such information with partners, prospective partners, and other affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.</p>
								<p>Jackpot.com may also disclose any of the non-personally identifiable information described above in order to (1) comply with applicable laws (including, without limitation, the CAN-SPAM Act), (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, or (4) protect the rights or property of Jackpot.com, the Network Sites or Members of this Site.</p>
