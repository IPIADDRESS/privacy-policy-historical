			<div class="entry-content clearfix mt20">
			<p>The following policy outlines the types of information that we gather about you and the way that way we use and don’t use this information.</p>
<p>The information that we collect about our visitors falls into three general categories:</p>
<p>1. Information You Provide to Us. We may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply to us either on the Japan Daily Press site, via e-mail, or in any other way. Some examples of this type of information include the information you submit (such as your name or e-mail address) when you register for Japan Daily Press membership, information that you post on blog entry comment, and information contained in search requests or questions you submit to the site. If you decline to supply or provide us with certain information, we may not be able to provide you with some services that are dependent on the collection of this information.</p>
<p>2. Information that is Automatically Collected. We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Japan Daily Press site. For example, to enhance your experience at Japan Daily Press, we use a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie.” Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use our site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of our site where you have entered preference information before. Another example of information that we automatically collect as you navigate our site is information about your computer’s connection to the Internet. This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on our site.</p>
<p>3. Information from Other Sources. Japan Daily Press may also obtain information about you from third parties or other sources and may combine the information that we receive from them with information we have already obtained about you.</p>
<p>Japan Daily Press includes links to other websites, and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through the Service, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.</p>
<p><strong>Questions on Privacy</strong></p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns about the children’s privacy statement, the privacy practices of the Japan Daily Press site, or your dealings with Japan Daily Press, please <a href="http://japandailypress.com/contact/" title="Contact Japan Daily Press">contact us</a>.</p>
