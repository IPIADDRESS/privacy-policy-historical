    <meta name="description" content="E-Mail Privacy As someone who gets almost 500 e-mail messages daily, I know exactly how much fun it is to get junk mail. I don't like junk in my inbox; I assume you don't want junk in your inbox either. To that end, I will never disclose your email address to anyone for any reason. Your e-mail address will not be sold to any third parties. Your e-mail address will not be given to any third parties. Your e-mail address will not be provided to current or future advertisers of Jake Ludington's Digital Lifestyle. Your privacy and e-mail security are of utmost importance, which is why I require all subscribers to the Jake Ludington's Digital Lifestyle mailing list to confirm their subscription. When you fill out our subscription form (or send ane-mail to the list subscription address), you will receive an automated message asking you to confirm your subscription. You must reply to this message before your subscription will be activated. If you don't reply to the confirmation message, you will never be added to our subscription database. I attempt to make unsubscribing just as easy. All you have to do is send a message to the same address you used to subscribe or use the convenient Web form linked at the bottom of every newsletter issue. If for some reason, I ever have a need to collect your postal address, I won't sell or give that to anyone either.
