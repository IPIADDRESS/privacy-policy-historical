</p>
<p>Jamster (“Jamster”) is operated by Fox Mobile Distribution, LLC as part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Principles</a> applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. Jamster has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S. both online and off-line.  This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Jamster.
</p>
<p>Jamster.com, the website operated by Jamster, is a general audience website and Jamster does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age.
</p>
<p>From time to time Jamster may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our information collection and use practices, the features of our websites, or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If Jamster materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of and have not objected to the change.  This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to Jamster's website <a href="terms-conditions/">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>COLLECTION</strong>: COLLECTION OF PII BY JAMSTER
</p>
<p>General. Jamster collects PII in order to create or enhance our relationship with you.  The types of PII that may be collected include your full name, email address, billing information or mobile telephone number) and such other information as may be requested from time to time.
</p>
<p>When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us when you (1) register on our website(s) to obtain downloadable mobile entertainment content, such as ringtones, games, graphics news and other information data (“Downloads”)and (2) sign up from Jamster Downloads without registering on Jamster.com, such as for one-time Individual Downloads or Subscriptions  via SMS using your mobile phone, or (3) participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, or chats or bulletin boards. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties and sources including public databases.
</p>
<p>Cookies.  Cookies are small bits of information that the Jamster website(s) places on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on the Jamster website(s) and enable Jamster to make your visits to the Jamster website(s) more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your password for easy logon to a site you have previously visited, or can save your preferences and subscription options for a personalized home page. Jamster uses cookies to identify your Internet browser, to determine whether you have installed the enabling software needed to access certain material on our website(s), to determine the total number of visitors to our website(s), and to recognize you when you return to the Jamster site.   Information about your activities on the Jamster website and other non-personally identifiable information about you may also be used to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests.
</p>
<p>Third party advertisements displayed on Jamster site(s) may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. Jamster does not control these cookies and visitors to our website(s) should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. See the "Notice" section below for more information on third party advertisements.
</p>
<p>Jamster may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our website(s) to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on Jamster website(s) may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if Jamster wishes to combine your personal and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.
</p>
<p>You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies you may not have access to certain features on Jamster's website(s) such as your subscription option page.
</p>
<p>Additionally, 	Jamster’s services (or third-party servers) may collect certain information about Jamster website visitors automatically for site maintenance, optimization, security, and other legal permissible purposes. Such information may include such visitors’ IP address, browser type, date, time, and duration of visit, and particular pages viewed.
</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE</strong>: JAMSTER WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES
</p>
<p>When you voluntarily provide PII to Jamster, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses Jamster will make of the information.
</p>
<p>At the time you provide your PII , Jamster will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below).
</p>
<p>This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore want to share your PII, provided you have given Jamster permission to do so (See "Use" below).
</p>
<p>Sometimes we collect PII from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.
</p>
<p>Jamster's website(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies.  Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Jamster logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by Jamster.
</p>
<p>Jamster's website(s) may also carry advertisements from other companies. Jamster is not responsible for the practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to our site(s) or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies. Once you have left the Jamster site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.
</p>
<p>Jamster's website(s) may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with Jamster (e.g., companies that are part of the News America Group). Although News America Group entities adhere to the Group’s <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Principles</a> visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.
</p>
<p><strong>CHOICE</strong>: JAMSTER WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII
</p>
<p>Jamster will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with Jamster (i.e., not part of the News America Group), unless we obtain your permission.
</p>
<p><strong>USE</strong>: JAMSTER'S USE OF PII
</p>
<p>Jamster will use the PII you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. If Jamster obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this Policy.
</p>
<p>For example, Jamster may use your PII and Registration Data to send you important information and notices regarding your account and Jamster services. In addition, when Jamster collects PII from you itself in connection with your Download request, we will process your subscription or service request, including order fulfillment and payment processing if appropriate. In those instances, Jamster will not share your credit card information with third parties except those Jamster uses to perform tasks (such as order fulfillment and payment processing)  required to complete purchases you make and subscriptions you place through Jamster.com.
</p>
<p>Or, an affiliate of Jamster may provide you with Downloads by collecting PII on Jamster’s behalf when you register on Jamster.com or sign up for individual Downloads using your mobile phone. Jamster’s affiliate provides Jamster with the PII it needs to provide you with the Downloads and other services you requested. Jamster’s affiliate also provides your mobile communications provider with the information it needs to bill you for the Downloads and other services you purchased.
</p>
<p>Jamster may also use PII in aggregate, anonymous form for research purposes.
</p>
<p>Jamster may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us that are part of the News America Group ). Provided you have given us permission, Jamster may share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with Jamster, but would like to send you information about their products and services. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with unaffiliated third parties when PII is collected.
</p>
<p>Jamster employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. Jamster may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use your PII to provide Jamster with a specific service and not for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>Jamster may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows Jamster to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on Jamster's website(s) .  Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on Jamster's website(s).may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished.  These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose.  Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with Jamster’s advertisers and business partners.
</p>
<p>There may be instances when Jamster may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Jamster, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our website(s); to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if Jamster sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Jamster may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.
</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong>: JAMSTER PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII
</p>
<p>Jamster uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, Jamster uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.
</p>
<p><strong>ACCESS, REMEDIES AND CONTACT</strong>: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII
</p>
<p>Whenever possible, visitors to Jamster may review the PII  they have provided to us in our records. We will take reasonable steps to correct any PII a visitor informs us is incorrect.
</p>
<p>If you ask Jamster to stop using your PII, Jamster will honor that request while retaining any record of your PII that is necessary to comply with applicable federal, state or local law.
</p>
