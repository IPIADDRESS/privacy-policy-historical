<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>1. The Information
JamLegend Collects:</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Information You
Provide: You may provide to JamLegend what is generally called
“personally identifiable” information (such as your name,
age, zip code, email address, credit card number, postal mailing
address, and telephone numbers) if you user certain services or
products from the JamLegend Platform, enter contests or sweepstakes,
or otherwise use the features and functionality of the JamLegend
Platform.</p>
<p>“Automatically
Collected” Information: When you access the JamLegend Platform
(including through your computer or your mobile device) or open one
of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information
from your system by using different types of tracking technology.
This “automatically collected” information may include
Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique user
ID, version of software installed, system type, your listening
preferences, the content and pages that you access on the JamLegend
Platform, and the dates and times that you visit the JamLegend
Platform.</p>
<p>“Cookies”
Information: When you access the JamLegend Platform, we may send one
or more cookies – small text files containing a string of
alphanumeric characters – to your computer. JamLegend may use
both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie
disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains
after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on
subsequent visits to the JamLegend Platform. Persistent cookies can
be removed. Please review your web browser “Help” file to
learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.</p>
<p>Your User ID. Your
User ID is displayed throughout the JamLegend Platform and is
therefore available to the public. Other people can see your
feedback, ratings and associated comments, etc. Therefore, if you
associate your actual name with your User ID, the people to whom you
have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your
activities on the JamLegend Platform.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>2. The Way JamLegend
Uses Information:</p>
<p>JamLegend uses the
information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain,
enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the
JamLegend Platform as well as to track user-generated content and
Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.</p>
<p>We may use your
email address or other provided contact (e.g. mobile number), without
further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying
you of major JamLegend Platform updates, for customer service
purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or
to contact you regarding any content that you have posted and to send
privacy or security related notices.</p>
<p>JamLegend uses all
of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and
preferences of our Users, to improve the way the JamLegend Platform
works and looks, to create new features and functionality.</p>
<p>JamLegend may use
“Automatically Collected” information and “Cookies”
information to: (a) automatically update the JamLegend application on
your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have
to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the
JamLegend Platform; (c) provide customized third-party
advertisements, content and information; (d) monitor and report on
the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (e) monitor and
report aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and
pages accessed; and (f) provide such metrics to Users as they pertain
to such User’s uploaded content; and (g) track your entries,
submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>3. When JamLegend
Discloses Information:</p>
<p>JamLegend does not
share your personally identifiable information with other
organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your
prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personally
identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on
any publicly available portion of the JamLegend Platform – such
as when you publish contact information to complete your profile
information – becomes publicly available and may be collected
and used by others without restriction.</p>
<p>JamLegend may
disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate
non-personally-identifiable information (such as IP addresses,
anonymous User usage data, listening preferences, referring / exit
pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with
interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding the
usage and demographic patterns for certain content, services,
advertisements, promotions, or other functionality on the JamLegend
Platform.</p>
<p>We may disclose some
limited User information to affiliated companies or other businesses
or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security
services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports;
offer certain functionality; and assist JamLegend in improving the
JamLegend Platform and creating new services features. We
contractually require that these parties process such information in
compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize only a limited use
of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable
confidentiality measures.</p>
<p>JamLegend may
disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the
good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state
and federal laws (such as U.S. copyright or trademark law) or respond
to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant
in the manner required by the requesting entity.</p>
<p>JamLegend also
reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in
good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against
liability; enforce our Terms of Use; protect JamLegend from
fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend
ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist
government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity
of the JamLegend Platform; or to protect the rights, property, or
personal safety of JamLegend, our Users, or others.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>4. Your Choices and
Access to your Personal Information</p>
<p>You may, of course,
decline to share your personally-identifiable information with
JamLegend, in which case JamLegend will not be able to provide to you
some of the features and functionality found on the JamLegend
Platform. You may view, update, correct, or delete your user
information and preferences by contacting us at privacy@JamLegend.com</p>
<p>To protect your
privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your
identity before granting you account access or making corrections to
your information. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF
YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.</p>
<p>5. Advertisers</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>JamLegend allows
other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to
serve advertisements within the JamLegend Platform. These third-party
ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to
your browser, the advertisements that appear within the JamLegend
Platform and they automatically receive your IP Address and other
automatically collected information when this happens. Such
third-party ad servers may also use other technologies (such as
cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of
their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>JamLegend does not
provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party
ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note
that if an advertiser asks JamLegend to show an advertisement to a
certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that
advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit
the description of the audience that they were trying to reach.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>You should consult
the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad
networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot
control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
JamLegend reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad
networks or ad servers in its discretion and JamLegend may not at all
times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this
Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>5.     Our
Commitment to Data Security:     
</p>
<p>JamLegend uses
commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical
safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal
information.  We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of
any information you transmit to JamLegend, and you do so at your own
risk.  Once we receive your transmission of information, JamLegend
makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our
systems.  However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such
information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by
breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
<p>If JamLegend learns
of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you
electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
JamLegend may post a notice on the JamLegend Platform if a security
breach occurs.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal
right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.  To receive
a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at
privacy@JamLegend.com.</p>
<p>6.     Our
Commitment to Children’s Privacy:</p>
<p>If you are under 13
years of age, then please do not use or access THE JAMLEGEND PLATFORM
at any time or in any manner. 
</p>
<p>Protecting the
privacy of young children is especially important.  For that reason,
JamLegend does not knowingly collect or maintain personally
identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age.  If
JamLegend learns that personally-identifiable information of persons
less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the
JamLegend Platform, then JamLegend will take the appropriate steps to
delete this information.</p>
<p>If you are the
parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become JamLegend
Platform member, then please contact JamLegend at
privacy@JamLegend.com to have that child’s account terminated
and information deleted.</p>
<p>The following are
some resources that may help parents and legal guardians in
monitoring and limiting your childrens' access to certain types of
material on the Internet.  While JamLegend does not endorse these
products, we provide information about them as a public service to
our community.

<p>8. International
Visitors:</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>For Users visiting
the JamLegend Platform from the European Union or other non-U.S.
territories, please note that any data you enter into the JamLegend
Platform will be transferred outside the European Union or such other
non-U.S. territory for use by JamLegend and its affiliates for any of
the purposes described herein. In addition, because JamLegend
operates globally, we may make information we gather available to
worldwide business units and affiliates. By providing any data on the
JamLegend Platform, you hereby expressly consent to such transfers of
your data to the United States or other countries.</p>
<p>9. In the Event of
Merger or Sale:</p>
<p>In the event that
JamLegend is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we
reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or
assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of
that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</p>
<p>10. Third Parties</p>
<p>Except as otherwise
expressly provided otherwise, this document addresses only the use
and disclosure of information we collect from you or that you
disclose to us. If you disclose your information to others besides
JamLegend, whether they are users of the JamLegend Platform or on
other sites or services, different rules may apply to their use or
disclosure of the information you disclose to them. JamLegend does
not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are
subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where
applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose
your personal information to others.</p>
<p>11. Changes and
Updates to this Privacy Policy:</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy
may be revised periodically without further notice to you and this
will be reflected by a “last modified” date below. Please
revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. In general, we only
use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy
Policy in effect when we received that personal information. Your
continued use of the JamLegend Platform constitutes your agreement to
this Privacy Policy and any future revisions.</p>
<p>For revisions to
this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our
use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we
will make reasonable efforts to notify you and obtain your consent
before implementing revisions with respect to such information.</p>
