<p> Privacy Policy for Jambool Inc. (dba Social Gold)</p>

<p> (Last Updated:  October 7, 2010)</p>

<p> On August 13, 2010, Jambool Inc was acquired by Google Inc.</p>

<p> This privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how we collect personally identifiable information in connection with our provision of the Social Gold payment service (“Information”) and how we disclose and protect that Information.  Your use of the Social Gold payment service (“Service”) indicates your consent to the practices described in this Policy. </p>

<p> We reserve the right to revise this Policy at any time.  If we make changes, we will notify you as may be required by law.  We will also post the current version of the Policy on our website at www.jambool.com (“Site”) and update the “last updated” date set forth above.  We encourage you to review our Policy periodically.  Although we may provide this Policy to you through other means, your use of the Service reflects your agreement to receive the Policy through our Site or through links in web-based games, social websites or other social applications that accept payments through our Service.</p>

<p> This Policy applies to our current and former customers.</p>

<p> In this Policy, we refer to “non-affiliated third parties” and “Social Gold Merchants.” A “non-affiliated third party” is any company other than a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with us.  A “Social Gold Merchant” is a company that operates, publishes or sells web-based games, social websites or other social applications and that accepts payments through our Service.</p>

<p> Information We Collect</p>

<p> We may collect Information about you from the following sources:</p>

<p>     * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms
<br>     * Information about your transactions with us, Social Gold Merchants or others
<br>     * Information we receive from third parties, including consumer reporting agencies
<br>     * Information about your use of our Service, including through “cookies”</p>

<p> Information We Disclose to Non-affiliated Third Parties</p>

<p> We may disclose all the Information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.  We do not otherwise disclose Information to non-affiliated third parties except as permitted by law.</p>

<p> Information that You Provide Both to Us and to a Social Gold Merchant</p>

<p> Please be aware that when you provide personal information such as your contact information, payment card information and transaction requests through some web-based games, social websites or other social applications, you will be providing that information to the Social Gold Merchant that operates, publishes or sells such games, websites or applications, in addition to us.  If your information is provided concurrently to us and to a Social Gold Merchant, you will be notified prior to your provision of information to the Social Gold Merchant.  This Policy does not apply to how such Social Gold Merchants may collect, use, disclose or protect such information, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of the Social Gold Merchants.  Please see the privacy policy of the applicable Social Gold Merchant to learn about its practices.</p>

<p> Information Security</p>

<p> We restrict access to Information about you to those employees who need to know that Information to provide products or services to you.  We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your Information.  While we have taken commercially reasonable efforts to guard your Information, we cannot guarantee that your information may not be accessed or disclosed through accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.</p>

<p> International Users</p>

<p> If you use our Service, or otherwise provide us with data, from outside the United States, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be transmitted outside your resident jurisdiction.  In particular, please note that your Information may be stored and processed in the United States.  The laws pertaining to the collection, use, disclosure and protection of Information in the United States may be more or less stringent than the laws of other countries.  By using this Site and this Service, you consent to your Information being stored and processed in the United States and handled as described in this Policy.</p>

<p> Cookies</p>

<p> We may use Cookies in connection with the Service.  Cookies are very small files that we send to your computer to uniquely identify your Internet browser.  Cookies allow us to collect data and Information about your use of our Service and your transactions with us.  They also allow us to personalize the Service and to allow you to use the Service more efficiently.  Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting.  You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit, including the Social Gold Merchant websites, by editing browser options.  If you decide not to accept cookies from the Service, you may not be able to use some of the Service’s features or services, and you may have a less satisfactory experience using the Service.</p>

<p> Web Beacons</p>

<p> We may use “web beacons.”  Web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, 1-by-1 GIFs and web bugs) are tiny graphic files placed on a web page which send a signal when a user has visited that page, allowing the website to collect standard access information, such as time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.  Our web beacons do not contain any personal information, and we do not link web beacons to Information about you.</p>

<p> Children</p>

<p> Our Service is not intended to be used by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect Information from children under the age of 13.</p>

<p> Safe Harbor</p>

<p> Google and its subsidiaries adhere to the U.S. safe harbor privacy principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and are registered with the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">U.S. Department of Commerce safe harbor program</a>.</p>
