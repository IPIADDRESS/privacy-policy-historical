<b>What rights do you have regarding your data?</b><br>
You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its

</p>
<h3>Analytics and third-party tools</h3>
<p>When visiting our website, statistical analyses may be made of your surfing behavior.
This happens primarily using cookies and analytics. The analysis of your surfing
behavior is usually anonymous, i.e. we will not be able to identify you from this data.

</p>

<h2>2. General information and mandatory information</h2>
<h3>Data protection</h3>
<p>The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously.
We treat your personal data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data
protection regulations and this privacy policy.
If you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be collected. Personal
information is any data with which you could be personally identified. This privacy
policy explains what information we collect and what we use it for. It also explains
how and for what purpose this happens.<br>

</p>

<h3>Notice concerning the party responsible for this website</h3>
<p>The party responsible for processing data on this website is:<br>
JAM Software GmbH<br>
Am Wissenschaftspark 26<br>
54296 Trier<br>
Telephone: 0651-145653-0<br>
Email: info2@jam-software.com<br>
The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others
decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (names, email
addresses, etc.).
</p>

<div class="privacy_interaction_block border">
<h4>Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</h4>	
<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You
may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal  <a href="mailto:info2@jam-software">email</a> or messeage via our <a href="/customers/contact.php">contact form</a> making this
request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.
</p>
</div>
<br>

<h3>Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h3>
<p>If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file
a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory
authority for matters related to data protection legislation is the data protection officer
of the German state in which our company is headquartered. A list of data protection
officers and their contact details can be found at the following link:<br>
<a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</a>.
</p>

<h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
<p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of
the transmission of confidential content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the
site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address
line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your
browser's address bar. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by
third parties.
</p>

<h3>Encrypted payments on this website</h3>
<p>If you enter into a contract which requires you to send us your payment information
(e.g. account number for direct debits), we will require this data to process your
payment. Payment transactions using common means of payment (Visa/MasterCard, direct
debit) are only made via encrypted SSL or TLS connections. You can recognize an
encrypted connection in your browser's address line beginning with "https://" and the lock icon in your browser line is visible.
In the case of encrypted communication, any payment details you submit to us cannot be read by third parties.
</p>

<h3>Information, blocking, deletion</h3>
<p>As permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time with information
free of charge about any of your personal data that is stored as well as its origin, the
recipient and the purpose for which it has been processed. You also have the right to
have this data corrected, blocked or deleted. You can contact us at any time using
the address given in our legal notice or using our <a href="/customers/contact.php">contact</a> form if you have further questions on the topic of personal data.
</p>

<h3>Opposition to promotional emails</h3>
<p>We hereby expressly prohibit the use of contact data published in the context of
website legal notice requirements with regard to sending promotional and
informational materials not expressly requested. The website operator reserves the
right to take specific legal action if unsolicited advertising material, such as email
spam, is received.

<h2>4. Data collection on our website</h2>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not
contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and
secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by
your browser.<br>
Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you
delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you
next visit the site. You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you
can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie.
Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under
certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when
closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.
Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide
certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to
Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest
in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical
errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also
stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.
</p>

<h3>Server log files</h3>
<p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser
automatically transmits to us in "server log files". These are:
</p>
  <ul>
      <li class="black">Browser type and browser version</li>
      <li class="black">Operating system used</li>
      <li class="black">Referrer URL</li>
      <li class="black">Host name of the accessing computer</li>
      <li class="black">Time of the server request</li>
	   <li class="black">IP address</li>
 </ul>
<p>These data will not be combined with data from other sources.
The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO, which allows the processing of
data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.
</p>

<h3>Contact form</h3>
<p>Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered
on the form, including the contact details you provide, to answer your question and
any follow-up questions. We do not share this information without your permission.
We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your
consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time. An
informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we
receive your request may still be legally processed.
We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion,
revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains
(e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions, especially
those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this
provision.
</p>

<h3>Registration on this website</h3>
<p>You can register on our website in order to access additional functions offered here.
The input data will only be used for the purpose of using the respective site or service
for which you have registered. The mandatory information requested during
registration must be provided in full. Otherwise, we will reject your registration.
To inform you about important changes such as those within the scope of our site or
technical changes, we will use the email address specified during registration.
We will process the data provided during registration only based on your consent per
Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An
informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we
receive your request may still be legally processed.
We will continue to store the data collected during registration for as long as you
remain registered on our website. Statutory retention periods remain unaffected.
</p>

<h2>5. Processing and transmission of data</h2>
<h3>Processing of data (customer and contract data)</h3>
<p>We collect, process, and use personal data only insofar as it is necessary to
establish, or modify legal relationships with us (master data). This is done based on
Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for
measures preliminary to a contract. We collect, process and use your personal data

<h2>7. Analytics and advertising</h2>
<h3>Analytics using Matomo (former Piwik)</h3>
<p>This website uses Matomo (www.matomo.org) for web analytics, a service provided by InnoCraft Ltd., 150 Willis St, 6011 Wellington, Neuseeland. 
Matomo uses so-called "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is transmitted to our webserver located in Germany and stored there. Matomo cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.<br>
<b>IP anonymization</b><br>
We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be shortened prior to transmission and saving. Matomo will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide us with other services regarding website activity and Internet usage. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Matomo Analytics will not be merged with any other data.

<h3>Google Remarketing</h3>
<p>Our websites use the features of Google Remarketing combined with the
cross-device capabilities of Google Ads (former AdWords). This service is
provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043,
USA.
This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing
created with Google Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google
Ads. This allows advertising to be displayed based on
your personal interests, identified based on your previous usage and surfing behavior
on one device (e.g. your mobile phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or
computer).
Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app
browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, any device
that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional
messaging.
</p>
<div class="privacy_interaction_block">
<h4>Turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account</h4>
<p>
You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off
personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link:
<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>.
</p>
</div>
<p>The aggregation of the data collected in your Google Account data is based solely on
your consent, which you may give or withdraw from Google per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO.
For data collection operations not merged into your Google Account (for example,
because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the
collection of data is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a
legitimate interest in analyzing anonymous user behavior for promotional purposes.

<h3>Google Ads and Google Conversion Tracking</h3>
<p>This website uses Google Ads. Google Ads is an online advertising program from
Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States
("Google").
As part of Google Ads, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on
an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text
files that your internet browser stores on your computer. These cookies expire after
30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit
certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the
website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.
Each Google Ads advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be
tracked using the website of an Google Ads advertiser. The information obtained using
the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the Google Ads
advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total
number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking
tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to
personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out
of this by easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your
browser settings. In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking
statistics.
Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator
has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and
its advertising.
For more information about Google Ads and Google Conversion Tracking, see
the Google Privacy Policy:
<a href="https://www.google.de/policies/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.google.de/policies/privacy</a>.
You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you
can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie.
Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under
certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when
closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.
