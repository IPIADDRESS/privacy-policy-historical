<p class="MediumBodyText2"><strong>The Information Jaman Collects</strong><span class="MediumBodyText2" style="font-family:Arial-BoldMT; "><strong><br>
</strong></span><span class="MediumBodyText2" style="font-family:Arial; "><em>Account Information:</em> You provide certain personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, credit card information –including billing address--, and age) to Jaman in order to participate in various activities on the Jaman Site such as uploading videos, posting messages in our forums or in the video comments section, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or receiving newsletters or other mailing lists.</span></p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2"><em>Profile:</em> You may also elect to provide information about yourself in your profile. Jaman does not require you to fill out a profile in order to participate in the service or community.&nbsp; Jaman makes no claims about the privacy of publicly available profile information.</p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2">Members of the Jaman Community have the ability to post reviews and comments on the Jaman web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the users' name, if they choose to use their own name as their Jaman community user name. We obtain the users consent to post their name prior to their posting.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2"><em>Cookies Information:</em> When you visit the Jaman Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Jaman uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Jaman Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>

<p class="MediumBodyText2"><em>Log File Information:</em> When you use the Jaman Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2"><em>Clear GIFs Information:</em> When you use the Jaman Site, we may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Members anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our Members to track which emails are opened by recipients.</p>
<p><em>Online Surveys and Polls: </em>Jaman values opinions and comments from members, so we may conduct online surveys. Participation in these surveys is entirely optional. Typically, the information is aggregated and used to make improvements to Jaman and to develop appealing content, features and promotions for members. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.</p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2"><strong>The Way Jaman Uses Information</strong><span class="MediumBodyText2" style="font-family:ArialMT; "><br>
</span><span class="MediumBodyText2" style="font-family:Arial; ">If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the Jaman Site, we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Jaman Site.</span></p>

<p class="MediumBodyText2"><strong><em>Details:</em></strong><span class="MediumBodyText2" style="font-family:ArialMT; "><br>
</span><span class="MediumBodyText2" style="font-family:Arial; "><em>Account information:</em> Your account information (for example, full name, email address, birth date, credit card number, and rental/purchase history) are collected for basic Jaman service.&nbsp; Jaman will use this information to fulfill our service to you as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="margin-top:0in;" type="disc">
  <li class="MediumBodyText2">Your full name      will be used to personalize communications to you and identify you in our      system (for user searches, etc)</li>
  <li class="MediumBodyText2">Your email      address will be used for identity verification, system messages, personal      Jaman messages (unsubscribe available in “User Preferences”), newsletter      (unsubscribe available in “User Preferences”), and other Jaman      communications. </li>

  <li class="MediumBodyText2">Your birth date      is used to determine whether you are of legal age to view mature content.</li>
  <li class="MediumBodyText2">Your credit card      information, including your billing address, will be used when you buy or      rent films.</li>
  <li class="MediumBodyText2">Your      rental/purchase history is used to establish licensing of films and      provide insight into the kinds of movies Jaman may want to offer in the      future.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MediumBodyText2"><em>Profile Information:</em>&nbsp; You elect to share as much or as little information about yourself in your personal profile.&nbsp; Jaman makes no claims on the privacy of information that you have elected to make public.</p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2">Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Members when you upload videos or send messages through the Jaman Site and other Members can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that you submit to the Jaman Site may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.</p>

<p class="MediumBodyText2"><em>Community Involvement: </em>&nbsp;If you use groups, reviews, or film blog on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums or by private message to other users.</p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2">We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out (for example, our newsletter). We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Jaman Site changes or for customer service purposes).</p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2">We will send you account and service-related announcements &nbsp;from time to time when it is necessary to do so.&nbsp; For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.&nbsp; Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.&nbsp; If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2">We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Jaman Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.</p>

<p class="MediumBodyText2">We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Jaman Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.</p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2"><strong><em>Important Note About Your Flash Viewing History</em></strong><br>

<p class="MediumBodyText2"><strong>When Jaman Discloses Information</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li class="MediumBodyText2">We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf.

  <li class="MediumBodyText2">We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Jaman Site.</li>
  <li class="MediumBodyText2">We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.</li>
  <li class="MediumBodyText2">Jaman also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information that Jaman believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Jaman, our Members or others.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="MediumBodyText2"><strong>Your Choices</strong><span class="MediumBodyText2" style="font-family:Arial-BoldMT; "><strong><br>
</strong></span><span class="MediumBodyText2" style="font-family:Arial; ">You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Jaman Site, in which case Jaman may not be able to provide certain services to you.

You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MediumBodyText2">Please contact Jaman with any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice, your personal information, your consent, or if you need help with your opt-in or opt-out choices (provided on the website) by emailing <span class="MediumBodyText2" style="font-family:ArialMT; "><a href="mailto:support@jaman.com"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">support@jaman.com</span></a></span><span class="MediumBodyText2" style="font-family:Arial; ">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2"><strong>Third-party Companies</strong><span class="MediumBodyText2" style="font-family:Arial-BoldMT; "><strong><br>
</strong></span><!--<span class="MediumBodyText2" style="font-family:Arial; ">Jaman may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Jaman Site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Jaman Site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.</span></p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2">Jaman does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Jaman to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Jaman Site, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MediumBodyText2">You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Jaman's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.&nbsp;</p>-->
