<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Jaman.com, Inc. ("Jaman," "we," or "us") knows that you care how information
about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of
yours will be collected by Jaman when you use Jaman.com (the "site") and
related services (the “Service”), how the information will be used, and how
you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We
will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this
Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<h4>User-Provided Information</h4>
<p>You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail
address, when you register with the Service. If you correspond with us by
email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address
and our responses. In addition, you may choose to add information about
yourself to your profile that you can then share with friends. You can modify,
delete, and set your privacy setting for this information any time in the My
Account section of the site after you have signed in using your personal
password.</p>
<h4>Cookies Information</h4>
<p>When you visit Jaman.com, we may send one or more cookies (a small text file
containing a string of alphanumeric characters) <strong>to</strong> your computer that
uniquely identifies your browser and lets Jaman help you log in faster and
enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie does not collect personal
information about you. Jaman uses both session cookies and persistent cookies.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.
Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the
site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s
directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your
browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate
when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not
function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
<h4>Log File Information</h4>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you
access a web page. When you register with or view our site, our servers
automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever
you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your
web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit
pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed,
and other such information.</p>
<h4>Beacon Information</h4>
<p>When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) and
certain third party web measurement and customization services include "Google
Analytics" and "Mixpanel" which are used to track the online usage patterns of
our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent
to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information
is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our
marketing, and make Jaman better for our users.</p>
<h5><em>Google Analytics</em></h5>
<p>Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”).
Google utilizes the Data collected to track and examine Service use, to
prepare reports on the Service’s activities and share them with other Google
services. Google may use the Data collected to contextualize and personalize
the ads of its own advertising network. Google Analytics does not collect
personally identifiable information through its cookie and does not combine,
match, or cross-reference NOAA.gov information with any other information.
Please review the Google Analytics privacy policy for additional information.</p>
<h5><em>Mixpanel</em></h5>
<p>MixPanel is a web analytics service provided by Mixpanel Inc.</p>
<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
<p>We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide
to you the features and functionality of the Service. Jaman never discloses
your personal information to any third party unless you have instructed us to
do so.</p>
<p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting
to the Service (for instance, in User Content you post) becomes available to
the public via the Service and our business partners. User Content includes,
but is not limited to, reviews, comments, and ratings and reviews. If you
remove User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages
or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
<p>By providing Jaman your email address you consent to our using the email
address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by
law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email
address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features
of the Service, or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email
messages, you may opt out by following the opt-out links. Opting out may
prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or
offers. You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p>Your name and, depending on your account settings, email address, are used
when you invite another person to join Jaman, or when a you request to add
another member to your friends list.</p>
<p>Jaman may use certain information about you and/or your User Content without
identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes
such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical
problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and
promotions.</p>
<p>Jaman may develop special sites in cooperation with other companies. If you
register at these "co-branded" sites, we may share your registration
information (such as name and email address) with that company.</p>
<p>Jaman reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content
you post on the site. Jaman has the right to remove any such information or
material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation, if in its
sole opinion, such information or material violates, or may violate, any
applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement or to protect or defend its
rights or property or those of any third party. Jaman also reserves the right
to remove information upon the request of any third party.</p>
<p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember
information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the
next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and
information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our service; (d) monitor
aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose
or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are
associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP;
and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.</p>
<h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>
<h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
<p>Jaman will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to
others. Jaman may share your personally identifiable information with third
parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do this,
such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy
Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct
control of Jaman (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with
hosting providers).</p>
<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings.
Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred
business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such
information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Jaman will not
disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by
law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform
to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or
investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal
activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against
liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims
or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the
security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights,
property, or personal safety of Jaman, our users or others.</p>
<h4>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage
data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.)
with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for
certain Jaman services.</p>
<p>Jaman allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to
serve advertisements on the Jaman site. These third-party ad servers or ad
networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements
and links that appear on Jaman. They automatically receive your IP address
when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies,
JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their
advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</p>
<p>Jaman does not provide any personally identifiable information to these
third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please
note that if an advertiser asks Jaman to show an advertisement to a certain
audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server
may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to
reach.</p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad
servers or ad networks. The Jaman privacy policy does not apply to, and we
cannot control the activities of, such advertisers.</p>
<h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>
<p>Jaman uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical
safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal
information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any
information you transmit to Jaman and you do so at your own risk. Once we
receive your transmission of information, Jaman makes commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this
is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed,
altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or
managerial safeguards.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as
requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you
access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of
your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to
your email communications from Jaman, at all times.</p>
<h3>Compromise of Personal Information</h3>
<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach
of security, Jaman will promptly notify those persons whose personal
information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification
procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by
applicable law.</p>
<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that
reason, Jaman does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable
information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Jaman Site from
persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to
persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or
access the Jaman Site at any time or in any manner. If Jaman learns that
personally identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has
been collected on the Jaman Site without verified parental consent, then Jaman
will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.</p>
<h3>Safe Harbor</h3>
<p>Jaman complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data
from the European Union.</p>
<h3>Special Note to International Users</h3>
<p>The Jaman Site are hosted in the United States and are intended for and
directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing the Jaman
Site from the Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing
personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States
laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Jaman Service,
which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our Terms of Use, you
are transferring your personal information to the United States and you
consent to that transfer.</p>
<h3>Business Transitions</h3>
<p>In the event Jaman goes through a business transition, such as a merger,
acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,
your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets
transferred. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web
site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal
information.</p>
<h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or
from our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Please
remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site,
our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on
any other Web site, including those that have a link on our Web site, is
subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those
rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
<h3>Notification Procedures</h3>
<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are
required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to
you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous
posting of such notice on our Website page, as determined by Jaman in its sole
discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing
notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of
notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes
on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it
and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy
Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
