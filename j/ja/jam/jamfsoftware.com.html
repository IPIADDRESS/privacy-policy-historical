			<p>JAMF Software is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. In order to provide certain services, opportunities, and downloads to you on jamfsoftware.com (the Site), we require that you submit some of your personal information. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.</p>
			
			<h2>Notice</h2>
			<p>JAMF Software (We) may collect domain names and aggregate information on what pages you access or view to improve the Site and to determine which pages are being accessed and used. We may also collect information volunteered by you including, but not limited to, e-mail addresses to obtain downloads or requests for services, opportunities, or additional information. This Site contains links to other websites. Please be aware that JAMF Software is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site.</p>

			<p>Also, entities into which our company may be merged, or entities to which any of our assets, products, sites or operations may be transferred, will be able to use personal information. We will also disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property. Please also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission.</p>
			
			<p>JAMF Software may amend this policy. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
