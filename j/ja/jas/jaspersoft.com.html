        <p>Effective March 13, 2007 , last updated March 13, 2007 </p>
        <p>JasperSoft is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the Web site www.jaspersoft.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. </p>

        <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Tom Vu at <a href="mailto:tom@jaspersoft.com"><strong>tom@jaspersoft.com </strong></a>.

        <p><strong>What Information We Gather and Track </strong><br> There are times when we may need to collect information from you through our Web site. This generally involves filling out forms so you can download or order a JasperSoft or third party product from our Web site. When you download the JasperSoft's PDF files and other product information, we may require you to fill out a form with your name and e-mail address. If you register on our site or sign up for a Webinar, we will request your name, company name, address, email address, and phone number. If you choose to subscribe to our newsletter and promotional emails, we will ask for your email address. </p>
        <p>JasperSoft uses various methods to collect certain other kinds of information, including: </p>
        <ul>
			<li>Cookies</li>
			<li>Referrers</li>
			<li>IP addresses</li>
			<li>System information</li>
		</ul>
        <p><br>None of these methods can be personally identified with you with the exception of cookies, which can optionally store information that you may enter in forms on our Web site, as described below. </p>
        <p>JasperSoft's software may use Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) to notify us of the installation of one of JasperSoft's products. </p>
        <p>A "cookie" is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. It can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience. Some JasperSoft pages use cookies. Cookies are used to better personalize the content, banners and promotions that you and other users will see. We may use the information to research and understand how our users' habits in the aggregate are similar or different so that we can enhance your experience on JasperSoft's sites and with our products. With your consent, cookies can optionally store information from forms that you fill out on our site so that next time you visit, you do not have to re-enter this information. For example, this would allow you to enter your zip code so that next time you visit, you can automatically see local content from your area. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. JasperSoft does not require that you accept cookies. Some of our business partners (e.g., third-party tracking services) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. </p>
        <p>A "referrer" is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically gathered by our Web server. This information is used by JasperSoft to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information. </p>
        <p>IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. They are automatically gathered by our Web server. JasperSoft will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information. </p>
        <p>System information we gather includes time, type of Web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed.
