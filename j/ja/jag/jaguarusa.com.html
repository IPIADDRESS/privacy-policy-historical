<p>Please  be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light”  requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our  response.
</p><h2><u>Use of  Information </u></h2>
<p>Information collected by JLR USA is used for  four main purposes.&nbsp; First, we collect  information to enable the features of the Website.&nbsp; Second, we collect information to improve the  Website by determining which of our products, features and services are most  popular.&nbsp; Third, we may now or in the  future collect information to personalize the experience of the users of the  Website.&nbsp; Finally, we collect information  to communicate with you and to inform you about JLR USA’s and third parties’ products  and services.</p>

<h2><u>Additional Ways that Information is Collected</u></h2>
<p><strong>Browser Log Files</strong></p>

<p>Our servers automatically log each visitor to the Website  and collect and record certain information about each visitor.&nbsp; This information includes or may include your  “Internet Protocol”, or IP, address, browser language, browser type, operating  system, domain names, browsing history (including time spent at a domain, time  and date of your visit), referring/exit web pages and URLs, and number of  clicks.&nbsp; The domain name and IP address  reveal nothing personal about the user other than the IP address from which the  user has accessed the Website. </p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, JLR USA and/or our advertisers or other  third parties may send a “cookie” to your computer.&nbsp; A cookie is a small piece of data that is  sent to your Internet browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s  hard drive and that can be re-sent to the serving website on subsequent visits.&nbsp; A cookie, by itself, cannot read other data  from your hard disk or read other cookie files already on your computer.&nbsp; A cookie, by itself, does not damage your  system.&nbsp; We, our advertisers and other  third parties may use cookies to identify and keep track of, among other  things, those areas of the Website and third party websites that you have  visited in the past in order to enhance your next visit to the Website.&nbsp; You can choose whether or not to accept  cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser, but some  functionality of the Website may be impaired or not function as intended. &nbsp;See the Third Party Opt Out section below.</p>

	<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong></p>

Web Beacons collect only limited  information that includes a cookie number; time and date of a page view; and a  description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides.&nbsp; We may also carry Web Beacons placed by third  party advertisers.&nbsp; These Web Beacons do  not carry any personally identifiable information and are only used to track  usage of the Website and activities associated with the Website. See the Third  Party Opt Out section below.</p>

	<p><strong>Unique Identifier</strong></p>

	<p>We may assign you a unique internal identifier to help  keep track of your future visits. We use this information to gather aggregate  demographic information about our visitors, and we use it to personalize the  information you see on the Website and some of the electronic communications  you receive from us.&nbsp; We keep this  information for our internal use, and this information is not shared with  others.</p>
	

<p><strong>Third  Party Opt Out</strong></p>

<h2><u>When Information Is  Disclosed By JLR USA</u></h2>
<p>In addition to the other times or occasions  on which we might disclose information about users of the Website, we might  also disclose information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that  such disclosure is necessary to: (1) comply with a legal process and applicable  laws; (3) enforce this Privacy Policy; (3) respond to claims that any  materials, documents, images, graphics, logos, designs, audio, video and any  other information provided from or on the Website violates the rights of third  parties; or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of JLR USA, its  users or the public.</p>

<p>We use reasonable precautions to keep the  information that is disclosed to us secure.&nbsp;  We provide personally identifiable information and  non-personally-identifiable information to our parent, subsidiary, affiliated  companies, and other businesses or persons for the purposes of processing such  information on our behalf and promoting the goods and services of our trusted  business partners (for example, navigation system map updates), some or all of  which may store your information on servers outside of the United States. &nbsp;We require that these parties agree to process  such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy or in a similar,  industry-standard manner, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of  such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security  measures.&nbsp; The use of your information by  one of our trusted business partners may be subject to that party’s own Privacy  Policy.</p>
<p>We may share non-personally identifiable  information (such as anonymous user usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs,  platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with third parties to demonstrate the  usage patterns for JLR USA’s advertisements, content, functionality promotions  and/or services on the Website and/or on third party websites.</p>
<p>We also reserve the right to disclose  personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable  information in connection with the enforcement of our Terms  and Conditions located at <a href="http://www.jaguarusa.com/terms/" class="modal" onclick="recordEvent('Terms', 'footer');">Jaguar</a> and <a href="http://www.landrover.com/us/en/lr/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">Land  Rover</a>, take precautions against  liability, to investigate and defend against any third-party claims or  allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security  or integrity of the Website, and to protect the rights, property, or personal  safety of JLR USA, our users or others.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer your  personally identifiable information, as well as any other information, in  connection with the sale or other disposition of all or part of the JLR USA  business and/or assets.&nbsp; We also cannot  make any representations regarding the use or transfer of your personally  identifiable information or other information that we may have in the event of  our bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or an assignment for  the benefit of creditors.&nbsp; Furthermore,  we cannot and will not be responsible for any breach of security by any third  parties or for any actions of any third parties (including other users of the  Website) that receive any of the information that is disclosed to us.&nbsp; The Website also links to a wide variety of  other websites and the Website may contain advertisements of third  parties.&nbsp; We are not and cannot be  responsible for the privacy policies of those websites of third parties or how  they treat information about their users. </p>

<p>For certain features available  through the Website, we may require the use of encryption technologies provided  for your protection and/or User Account.&nbsp;  We use reasonable precautions to protect the privacy of your UserID,  password and User Account information. &nbsp;You,  however, are ultimately responsible for protecting your UserID, password and  User Account information from disclosure to third parties, and you are not  permitted to circumvent the use of required encryption technologies.&nbsp; You agree to: (a) immediately notify JLR USA of any  unauthorized use of your UserID, password and/or User Account, and/or any other  breach of security; and (b) ensure that you exit from your User Account at the  end of each session.&nbsp; While we may  provide certain encryption technologies and use other reasonable precautions to  protect your confidential information and provide suitable security, we do not  and cannot guarantee or warrant that information transmitted through the internet  is secure, or that such transmissions are free from delay, interruption,  interception or error.&nbsp; </p>
<h2><u>Employment  Opportunity Information Collection</u></h2>
<p>For individuals interested in job  opportunities with JLR USA,  the Website links prospective employees to a partner’s website.&nbsp; The partner’s website, which has its own  Privacy Policy, collects personal information from prospective employees for  human resources recruitment purposes.&nbsp;  This information is then shared with JLR USA’s human resources  department and others within JLR USA who are involved in the recruitment  process.</p>
<h2><u>Information  From Children</u></h2>
