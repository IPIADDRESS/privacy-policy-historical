						communications you have opted to receive or not to 
						receive.<br>

						<br>
						Cookies:&nbsp; As with many Websites, our Website uses a 
						technology called "cookies."&nbsp; A cookie is a unique, 
						random number that is stored in the browser on your 
						computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify you, just 
						the computer that is used to visit the site. Cookies 
						automatically identify your browser to the Website 
						whenever your computer is used to visit the Website.&nbsp; 
						Cookies also let us know how many people visit our 
						website and where visitors go on the site. In addition, 
						cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable 
						information, like what web browser is being used to 
						access the website. For registered users, cookies can 
						make using the Website easier for you by saving 
						information such as your passwords or preferences.&nbsp; 
						By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies 
						help us determine which areas are popular and which are 
						not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are 
						based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies 
						allows you, among other things, to personalize your 
						experience on the Website. Cookies may also allow the 
						Website to present to you advertising which may be of 
						interest to you. If you do not want information 
						collected through the use of cookies, your browser 
						should contain an option that allows you to disable or 
						delete cookie data at any time.&nbsp; Some areas of the 
						Website, however, may not provide you with a 
						personalized experience if you have disabled the use of 
						cookies. These cookies are not tied to personal 
						information.<br>
						Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technology: &nbsp;Our Website 
						uses a variety of technical methods for tracking 
						purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small 
						pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages 
						of Web sites. We also use these technical methods to 
						analyze the traffic patterns on our Web sites, such as 
						the frequency with which our users visit various parts 
						of our Web sites. These technical methods may involve 
						the transmission of information either directly to us or 
						to another party authorized by us to collect information 
						on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in 
						HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine 
						whether our guests have opened those e-mails and/or 
						clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from 
						use of these technical methods is not collected in a 
						form that is personally identifiable. <br>
						IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data: We may collect IP 
						addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a 
						number associated with the service through which you 
						access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service 
						provider), your company, or your university. Standing 
						alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. 
						At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of 
						system administration and to report aggregate 
						information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example 
						regarding the frequency with which our guests visit 
						various parts of our sites. We may combine this 
						information with personally identifiable information.&nbsp; 
						Click-stream data is information collected by our 
						computers when you request Web pages from the Website. 
						Click-stream data may include such information as the 
						page served, the time, the source of the request, the 
						type of browser making the request, the preceding page 
						view and other such non-personal information. When 
						analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive 
						at the Website, what type of content is most popular, 
						what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in 
						particular kinds of content and advertising, and the 
						like.<br>
						Transaction Information: If you conduct a financial 
						transaction with our Website, such as paying your annual 
						invoice or buying tickets, we will ask you to complete 
						an order form that will request certain information from 
						you, including contact information, demographic 
						information and financial information.&nbsp; We will use 
						this information to complete the transaction that you 
						have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, 
						products or other services that you order, and to 
						invoice you.&nbsp; For your protection, such information 
						is collected through encrypted means.<br>
						&nbsp;<br>
						HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED <br>
						As applicable, the information you provide to us may be 
						used to:<br>
						contact you about the Website; <br>
						contact you relating to your membership status; <br>
						confirm or fulfill an order you have made; <br>
						inform you of a prize you have won;<br>
						monitor or improve the use of the Website; <br>
						customize the advertising and content you see; <br>
						monitor compliance with our terms and conditions of use 
						of the Website; and<br>
						send you promotional material or special offers on 
						behalf of our marketing partners and/or their respective 
						affiliates and subsidiaries and other third parties.<br>
						&nbsp;<br>
						WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED<br>
						At times, we may share your personal information with 
						others for various purposes.&nbsp; The following 
						outlines the ways in which your information may be 
						shared with others and the ways in which you may opt-out 
						of having your information shared:<br>
						Agents: We employ other businesses, certain services and 
						individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples 
						include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing 
						repetitive information from customer lists, Website 
						analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing 
						assistance, processing credit card payments, and 
						providing customer service. They may have access to 
						personally identifiable information needed to perform 
						their functions, but may not use it for their own 
						purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their 
						products.&nbsp; Jaguars.com uses framing techniques to 
						provide our users a seamless experience. Some pages may 
						have the look and feel of the Jaguars site, such as 
						pages by Football Fanatics, Channel 1 Media, and Bellina 
						Technologies but to be aware that these pages are 
						actually hosted by a 3rd party company and any 
						information submitted here is being submitted directly 
						to that 3rd party.<br>
						Aggregate Information: We may share aggregate 
						information, such as demographics and Website usage 
						statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other 
						organizations. When this type of information is shared, 
						the other parties do not have access to your personally 
						identifiable information.<br>
						Other Promotional Offers:&nbsp; We may send offers to 
						you on behalf of our marketing partners. When we do 
						this, we do not give that partner your name and address. 
						If you do not want to receive such offers, you use the 
						opt out method detailed in the email or change your 
						preferences by logging into your account.<br>
						Business Transfers:&nbsp; In the event that all or 
						substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred 
						to another party, or another transaction occurs in which 
						your personally identifiable information is one of the 
						business assets transferred, all personally identifiable 
						information that has been collected and saved may be one 
						of the business assets we transfer.&nbsp; Please see 
						"YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY AND NOTIFICATION 
						OF CHANGES TO THE POLICY" section below.<br>
						Administrative or Legal Process:&nbsp; Your personal 
						information may be transferred to third parties without 
						notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, 
						law enforcement agencies, to protect our rights, or 
						protect the rights of other users of this website. <br>
						&nbsp;<br>
						CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND MESSAGE BOARDS<br>
						The Website may make chat rooms, forums and message 
						boards available to its users. You are not required to 
						provide any personal information when using these areas 
						but you may choose to do so. If you post personal 
						information online, it will be publicly available and 
						you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. 
						We cannot ensure the security of any information you 
						choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message 
						board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have 
						access to such publicly available information will 
						respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when 
						deciding to disclose personal information in these 
						areas.&nbsp; See "A Special Note for Parents Concerning 
						Privacy" section below.<br>
						&nbsp;<br>
						LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES<br>
						<br>
						You should be aware that when you are on the Website you 
						could be directed to other Websites beyond our control. 
						For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, 
						the "click" may take you off the Website onto a 
						different Website. This includes links from advertisers, 
						sponsors and marketing partners that may use the 
						Website's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These 
						other Websites may send their own cookies to you, 
						independently collect data or solicit personal 
						information and may or may not have their own published 
						privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked 
						to our Website, you should consult that Website's 
						privacy policy before providing any personal 
						information.<br>
						&nbsp;<br>
						SECURITY<br>
						This Website incorporates reasonable safeguards to 
						protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy 
						and privacy of the personal information that we may 
						collect and we have put into place reasonable 
						precautions to protect such information from loss, 
						misuse and alteration. Your personally identifiable 
						information is transferred to our computers utilizing 
						encryption software. Only those employees who need 
						access to your information in order to do their jobs are 
						allowed access. Our security policies are reviewed 
						periodically and revised as required.<br>
						&nbsp;<br>
						A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS CONCERNING PRIVACY <br>
						Please take the time to review this section so that you 
						know exactly how we collect and use information, and how 
						you can review or request that we delete your child's 
						information.&nbsp; If you have any questions or concerns 
						about this policy, please contact us at 
						privacy@jaguars.com.&nbsp; <br>
						The jaguars.com Message Board<br>
						At jaguars.com and jaguars.com/mb, boys and girls can 
						enter contests, vote in surveys, participate in forums, 
						signup for newsletters, send messages to their friends, 
						submit questions about the team, learn more about all 
						the positions in football and how to play them, and even 
						meet real NFL stars and the teams of people behind the 
						scenes who make the team and the entire NFL work.&nbsp;

						about and understand the greatest sport around.<br>
						We do not ask for any personal information beyond what 
						is reasonably necessary for your child to participate in 
						jaguars.com/mb activities.&nbsp; When information is not 
						required to administer an activity, we clearly mark that 
						information as optional. <br>
						Some activities offered on jaguars.com/mb might disclose 
						some of your childâ€™s personal information to 
						third-parties on the Internet, such as the message 
						boards.&nbsp; Before allowing your child to use a 
						feature of our website that might result in the 
						disclosure of the childâ€™s information to third-parties 
						on the Internet, we require an authorization form signed 
						by a parent to confirm that the parent has given 
						permission for the childâ€™s participation in such 
						activity<br>
						Parental Approval, Consent and Review <br>
						When a child signs up for an activity where we collect 
						and save personally identifiable information, such as 
						multiple email updates, they will be required to provide 
						only their name, email address and a parent's email 
						address. We ask for a parent's email address so we can 
						help moms and dads stay aware of their children's online 
						activities as described above.&nbsp; <br>
						Parents at any time can send an email to
						<a href="mailto:privacy@jaguars.com">privacy@jaguars.com</a>&nbsp; 
						to review the information collected about your child, 
						request that it be deleted, or request that your 
						children be removed from mailing lists.&nbsp; <br>
						Other Privacy Information<br>
						We will only use personally identifiable information 
						collected on jaguars.com/mb for the purpose for which it 
						is collected.<br>
						We may amend this privacy policy at any time.&nbsp; We 
						will send an email or postal notice regarding material 
						changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share 
						childrenâ€™s personal information to parents who have 
						granted permission for us to collect their childrenâ€™s 
						personally identifiable information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						Please note that parents should always update their 
						personal information to provide us with current contact 
						information.&nbsp; <br>

						YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY AND NOTIFICATION 
						OF CHANGES TO THE POLICY<br>
						By using this Website, you signify your agreement to the 
						terms of our privacy policy.&nbsp; We may amend this 
						privacy policy at any time.&nbsp; If we make a material 
						change to the way in which we collect, use, and/or share

						website and / or send an email to users who have 
						provided an email address.&nbsp; We will assume that you

						&nbsp;<br>
						YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS<br>
						A California privacy law that went into effect on 
						January 1, 2005, allows California residents to obtain 
						specific information about a businessâ€™s privacy 
						practices if it shares information with other companies 
						for those companiesâ€™ direct marketing purposes.&nbsp;
						<br>
						As explained in this privacy policy, whenever you agree 
						to let us collect personal information about you, we 
						will always provide you with an option to prevent this 
						information from being shared for non-administrative 
						purposes with third parties.&nbsp; You can exercise this 
						option at any time by following the steps outlined 
						above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
						Because this website has a comprehensive privacy policy 
						and provides you with details on how you may opt-in / 
						opt-out of the use of your personal information by third 
						parties for direct marketing purposes, we are not 
						required to provide you with this information.<br>
