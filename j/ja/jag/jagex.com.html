<b>Introduction</b><br>
<p>
This is the privacy policy of Jagex Limited and any companies within our group (referred to collectively as "Jagex"). It applies to all of our websites / services (referred to collectively as "our websites") on which it appears.
</p>
<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and take special measures to ensure the confidentiality of personally identifiable information collected from or about you. This privacy policy explains how we collect, store and use such personally identifiable information. ("Personally identifiable information" is information that identifies you and can be used to contact or locate you in real life, such as your real full name, e-mail address, mobile number, postal address or credit card information.)
</p>
<p>Please read this policy carefully. Your accepting it in full is a condition of your use of our websites (whether or not you are a subscriber). If you don't agree with this policy, or any part, please don't use our websites. Your using any of our websites is treated as an acceptance of the version of this policy in effect at the time of your use.</p>
<p>We may change this policy at any time. Please check it whenever you return to the site. We will treat your continued use of our websites as acceptance of these changes from their effective date as shown above.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us by emailing <span class="email"><img src="http://www.jagex.com/img/corporate/images/email_privacy1.gif" width="124" height="13" alt="privacy[at]jagex.com"></span>
and do not use our websites until you are satisfied and can accept this
policy in its entirety.</p>
<p>In this privacy policy, "the Game" is used as shorthand for "RuneScapeÂ®" in all its versions (including RuneScape Classic).</p>
<p>References to "Terminating" an account include all or any of: locking / suspending, temporarily banning or permanently banning the account.</p>
<p>
<b>
A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT PRETEENS AND USERS UNDER 18</b><br>
If you are under the age of 13, you must not create an account. We don't knowingly permit anyone under 13 to use any of our websites. Nor do we knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from preteens. Internet safety experts have advised that preteens do not fully appreciate the risk of providing too much personal information online or communicating with strangers they encounter online. And the game difficulty level is for teenagers and older. While we appreciate that many preteens would want to use our websites, we urge parents to instruct their children not to lie about their age so as to be able to use our websites before they are old enough. Instead, we recommend that parents set up an account and play together with their preteens who are otherwise too young to play the Game or our other games. Many parents have reported that playing our games as a family is fun and rewarding. Then when your children are 13 they will be ready for their own account.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we want to remind parents that they need to spend time with their children and teens and take an active role in their safety online and offline. They should work to help teach them not to give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet. We are working closely with Parry Aftab and WiredSafety.org in helping teach all users how to protect themselves and others online and use all interactive technologies responsibly. This will include guidance for parents on safer use of our websites. You can access our internet safety materials <a target="_top" href="http://www.runescape.com/kbase/viewcategory.ws?cat_id=827" class="c">here</a> and select materials from WiredSafety.org by clicking <a href="http://www.wiredsafety.org/" target="_blank" class="c">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are under 18, by using our website you are representing that you have permission from your parents or legal guardian to use our sites and to our terms and conditions and privacy policy. We reserve the right to Terminate any account if we are not satisfied that such permission has been given.</p>
<p>If we are notified by a parent that their preteen has lied about their age when registering on our websites, we will Terminate the account provided we have confirmation which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent.</p>
<p>Parents can reach us by emailing <span class="email"><img src="http://www.jagex.com/img/corporate/images/email_parents.gif" width="175" height="13" alt="parents[at]jagex.com"></span></p>
<p><b>What personally identifiable information do we collect and store?</b><br>
No personally identifiable information is collected when you merely access the public areas of our websites or when you play our single player games.</p>
<p>We collect and store information which you voluntarily provide via forms or otherwise on our websites, electronic or other communications with us, communications between users on our websites, or information provided to our billing partners websites. You may opt-out of providing any such information by simply choosing not to complete the form requesting the information, and hence choosing not to use that particular service.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>To play certain of our games or use certain areas of our websites you will need to open an account by choosing a username and password.</li>
<li>To subscribe for the Game you will also need to provide contact information including: your name, a valid email address, gender, home address, phone/fax number, zip/postal code, and country, together with payment details (such as credit card number and expiry date).</li>
<li>To make use of our customer support service you will need to access the customer support section using your username and password and supply information relating to your query via the online form.</li>
<li>To enable us to provide a better customer support service we may also ask you provide contact information including: your name, email, postcode and country, and to provide a number of security questions which we can use to verify your identity if you require assistance in the future. (Note that the questions and the answers you provide are up to you. You may opt-out of providing some of this information but it will limit the availability or effectiveness of our support service if you do.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>
What other information is collected and stored?</b><br>
We use cookies, collect and store IP-addresses, alphanumeric IDs and other unique identifiers in order to identify specific computers that access our websites.</p>
<p>We generate and store logs indicating usage of our websites such as activity in our games and public and private chat communications. This includes monitoring play patterns and anti-tamper checks which verify the correct internal operation of our software and are designed to spot abusive or inappropriate activities.</p>
<p>We may track your use of certain features and areas of our websites to help us improve these.</p>
<p>If our client software held on your computer fails, it sends an automatic error report to our server to help us fix it. This error report only includes information about the internal state of our own client software and which browser/java version it is running on. It does not include data from elsewhere on your system and so does not reveal personally identifiable information to us.</p>
<p>We store 'save game' and 'game settings' information to enable us to provide a better games service in which your activities and achievements are remembered in the game and conduct polls to find better ways of serving the needs of our users.</p>
<p>
<b>
What happens to the information provided/collected?</b><br>
The information we collect may be used:</p>
<p>a) To process your payment for membership subscriptions or other goods or services ordered on our site or to fulfil such orders.</p>
<p>b) To provide our customer support service, and to verify any claims or requests you make if you use our customer support service.</p>
<p>c) To enforce our terms and conditions, and prevent or detect hacking activities, security breaches or safety risks in connection with our websites.</p>
<p>d) To send service announcements and messages. (For example a reminder is sent to members' Message Centre if a subscription payment is due.)</p>
<p>e) To aggregate information to generate anonymous statistics regarding use of our websites. We may share this anonymous information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>
<p>f) For our own internal marketing and demographic studies and to help us improve our websites.</p>
<p>g) In the event of an actual or proposed (including as part of negotiations for any) merger, or business combination or sale of substantially all of our assets or a business operation to which such information relates, or as provided under bankruptcy or applicable insolvency laws or by the enforcement of equitable rights.</p>
<p>h) To disclose information to the extent required by law, court order, as requested by other government, regulatory or law enforcement authority, to protect or assist in protecting our users, systems or the public, or to otherwise enforce legal rights as determined in our sole and absolute discretion.</p>
<p>We care about protecting your privacy, except as specified above we will not sell, transfer, rent, share or disclose your personally identifiable information to other companies. We will not use your email address to send you 'spam' or authorize others to do so.</p>
<p>

Persistent cookies also allow you to login when you return to the site, by storing your login information on your own computer.

<b>
Third Parties</b><br>
We partner with outside third parties to provide specific services as follows.</p>
<p>We use outside billing companies to process membership payments securely. We share your billing information with such companies insofar as necessary for the processing of your payment or to prevent or detect fraud. These companies have agreed not to retain, share, store or use your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
<p>We may supply your personally identifiable information to outside third parties to enable them to fulfil orders placed for Game or other merchandise.</p>
<p>Please note that this privacy policy does not apply to websites or services of other companies or organisations to which we link or which link to us or which provide goods or services to our users from their websites (such as co-branded, white label or affiliate sites or sites selling Game merchandise)..</p>
<p>We use outside companies to provide and serve the adverts on our website. These companies may use information (not including personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

<p>We may employ third parties who may collect personal information on our behalf. In such cases, we will instruct such third parties to comply with our privacy policy in effect at that time. Furthermore, information collected by third parties from our users providing goods or services (including adverts) at or via our websites may be shared with us and stored by us for the purposes stated in this policy).</p>
<p>Be very careful before making or posting any communications on our websites. Certain information is visible to other players of the game including: public and private chat communications, the appearance of your characters and your experience points. Players who include you on their friends list can see which in-game world you are playing on.</p>
<p>
<b>
Safeguarding your personally identifiable information</b><br>
We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent we believe it reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and will protect it using the same level of safeguards we use to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of our own equivalent proprietary information. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties to whom we transfer any personally identifiable information in accordance with this policy will agree to provide sufficient protection. We may store or transfer personal information outside the European Economic Area for the purposes stated in this policy.</p>
<p>Note that while we strive to protect all our personally identifiable information, we have all heard of data breaches in well-respected financial and governmental institutions and we cannot ever fully guarantee that such breaches will not happen. We will tell you of any material data breaches which we discover that compromise your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>
<b>
