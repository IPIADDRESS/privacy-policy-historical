JadooTV Inc. respects your privacy. This Privacy Statement explains    what information we collect through our websites (the "Sites"), through    our products and when you contact us for support, how we use that    information, and what choices you have.<br>
<br>
The Sites may contain links to other web sites. This Privacy Statement    does not apply to the practices of any company or individual that    JadooTV Inc. does not control, or any web sites that you link to from    the Sites. You should carefully review the privacy policies of any web    sites that you visit from ours to learn more about their information    and privacy practices. The collection and use of your personal    information shall be governed by such other party or site's privacy    policy. JadooTV Inc. is not responsible for their privacy practices.<br>
<br>
Please take a few moments to read this Privacy Statement. By accessing    the Sites or using a JadooTV product, you agree to accept the terms and    conditions of this Privacy Statement and are aware that our policies    may change in the future.<br>
<br>
<strong>What information we collect</strong><br>
In various places on the Sites and through the JadooTV   products, we  collect "Personally Identifiable Information" such as your   name,  mailing address, telephone number, email address, or other   information  that can be used to identify you or contact you. For   example, we  collect this information when you create an account,   register for our  message boards, sign up for our email newsletter, and   purchase from our  website or register a JadooTV product, download a   software update,  enter a sweepstakes or participate in surveys,   promotions and  give-away. From time to time in the future we may offer   software  updates, upgrades, additional features, services and   promotional  opportunities that would require you to submit Personally   Identifiable  Information to participate.<br>
<br>
We also collect "Anonymous Information" such as your IP   address, the  type of browser you use, the pages on our Sites that you   visit, the  search terms that you enter or the advertisements that you   click.  Anonymous information can and will NOT be associated with   Personally  Identifiable Information.<br>
<br>
Like many Internet sites, we also use "cookies" to collect   information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your   computer and is  stored on your hard drive. When you visit our Sites the   cookie  identifies your computer to us so that you do not have to   re-register  each time you visit. We also use cookies to measure the   traffic to and  usage of our site and its different services and   features, and other  miscellaneous uses.<br>
<br>
We also collect the personal information of third parties that is    provided by visitors who submit that personal data through our Sites,    in connection with, for example, referrals or gift purchases.<br>
<br>
JadooTV products upload usage information to JadooTV as part of their    normal functioning. The collected information includes the specific    identifiers of streams played, duration played, various quality    measures, error logs, software version numbers, and other usage    statistics. Usage information uploaded from JadooTV products is    personally identifiable by product serial number. In some cases, serial    numbers are associated with personally identifiable information for    customer service and support.<br>
<br>
The information collected from many users is aggregated for analysis    and, in some instances, made generally available anonymously to users    of JadooTV products and JadooTV services. For example, JadooTV may use    such information to provide features such as lists of popular videos.    JadooTV may also use personally identifiable information to make    content recommendations to individual users.<br>
<br>
If you do not wish JadooTV to use your information as described in this    section, please follow the procedure in "What Choices You Have" below.<br>
<br>
We do not intend that children will use the Sites. We do not solicit or    knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age, nor    will we accept registration from them.<br>
<br>
<strong>How we use the information we collect<br>
</strong>We use Personally Identifiable Information that you provided   us to  perform the services for which the data was collected, such as   for  order fulfillment, customer support and marketing activities, such   as  e-mail newsletters and sending you information about products and    services that may be of interest to you. Later on in this Privacy    Statement, we provide you with more information on how to opt-out of    marketing communications.<br>
<br>
We use non-Personally Identifiable Information to determine how people    use the Sites and its services and to analyze usage and performance of    our products and their software and features. For example this data    tells us information including how often users click on our    advertisements, which files are downloaded most frequently, and which    areas of our site are the most popular. Analyzing this data allows us    to improve our products and services.<br>
<br>
<strong>How we share information</strong><br>
We sometimes use third parties to help with certain aspects of our    operations, such as processing credit card payments and providing    marketing assistance. When we supply Personally Identifiable    Information to these third parties, we require them to use it only for    the function they are contracted to perform.<br>
<br>
We aggregate the Anonymous Information that we collect and exchange it    with advertisers and others who are interested in our services.<br>
<br>
We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information as required by    law, or if in our judgment it is necessary to protect JadooTV Inc. or    our users from loss or liability. We may share some or all of your    personal information with our current or future "affiliates" (which    means a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other    companies under a common control), in which case we will require our    affiliates to honor this privacy policy. If we merge with or are    acquired by another company, the resulting combined company will use    the information you have provided as described in this policy. If we    cease operation, your information may be transferred to and used by    another company that offers similar or related products or services.    While we cannot predict about such an unlikely event, we would hope    this could provide you continuity of service.<br>
<br>
<strong>What choices you have<br>
</strong>If you do not want to receive information about our products   and  services or do not want to receive information from our partners   and  others about products and services that might interest you, you can    send an email to JadooTV Inc. at privacy@jadootv.com. This e-mail   address  is being protected from spambots, you need JavaScript enabled   to view  it . We will keep track of your decision in our database. Even   if you  choose not to receive information from us, we reserve the right   to  communicate with you on matters we consider especially important    relating to our products or services.<br>
<br>
<strong>Postings</strong><br>
If you register to use our bulletin boards, please remember that    anything you post is publicly available. Your profile will also be    available to other users of our bulletin board service.<br>
<br>
<strong>Security</strong><br>
During sessions in which you give us information such as credit card    numbers, we encrypt your transmissions using SSL ("Secure Sockets    Layer"), and other security technology. This guards against the    interception of the information while it is on the Internet. We keep    the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers that are    protected by firewalls and other technological means against intrusion    or unauthorized access. They are located in a physically secure    facility, and only our employees and agents with a need to know the    information are given access. However, there is no such thing as    "perfect security" on the Internet. We rely on you to select passwords    that cannot be guessed easily and to safeguard those passwords from    disclosure. Third parties may unlawfully access transmissions or    private communications. Please contact us if you have any information    regarding unauthorized use of the Sites.<br>
<br>
