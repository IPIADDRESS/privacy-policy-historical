<p>
While using this service, you provide third party email addresses which are owned by you. This data may be imported using an import contacts or database upload feature. JangoMail and its parent company will never sell, rent, share, or otherwise make available your email lists and/or databases to anyone except internal support personnel who may be assisting you in troubleshooting your account, unless it is required to do so in connection with legal process or in accordance with any law, regulation or order of a court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction. JangoMail is not in the business of selling data. JangoMail is in the business of providing a web-based mass email service. </p>
<p></p><h3>Website Usage Information</h3><p></p>
<p>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We do not link your IP address to any personally identifiable information. We use tracking information to determine which areas our site users visit based on traffic to those areas. JangoMail does not track what individual users read, but rather how often each page is visited. This helps us maintain a superior and informative website for you. </p>
<p></p><h3>The Information We Collect</h3><p></p>
<p>
Our registration forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, address, and facts about your company size, and similar information. We do not request sensitive information from our visitors, such as credit card or social security numbers, unless they are signing up for and paying for our services. We never sell, share or trade any of our customer information with other companies. </p>
<p></p><h3>Access</h3><p></p>
<p>
If you want access to your information to make changes or corrections, please login to your account and update it under “Account Info.” If you would like your information deleted, please contact us as described below and we will respond within 30 days. We may be required to retain some data to meet legal retention requirements. If this is the case, we will let you know in our response to your inquiry. </p>
<p></p><h3>Tell-A-Friend</h3><p></p>	
<p>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. JangoMail stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one time email and tracking the success of referrals made through this program. </p>
<p></p><h3>Import Contacts</h3><p></p>	
<p>
We utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts and/or other subscribed members to your campaigns. We make it easy for you to connect with your data in a variety of formats so that you can use it to send campaigns to these contacts from our site. At your request, we will may work directly with your data (address book, spreadsheet, other data source) to assist you with this import connection. </p>
<p></p><h3>Newsletters</h3><p></p>	
<p>
JangoMail sends newsletters and other communications to those who subscribe on our site for the newsletter, free trial, or paid membership. We will use your name and email address to send these communications to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe in these email messages by visiting <a href="https://www.jangomail.com/opt_out.asp">https://www.jangomail.com/opt_out.asp</a>, entering your email address and clicking on Unsubscribe or clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email . Newsletters and other JangoMail communications may include tracking technologies that allow us to see when messages have been opened, links clicked, and pages in our own web site visited as a response to the emailing. </p>
<p></p><h3>Agents</h3><p></p>	
<p>
We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purpose. </p>
<p></p><h3>Security Technology</h3><p></p>
<p>
JangoMail has made a substantial investment in the latest server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect our information assets. These technologies are deployed as part of sophisticated security architecture. All data resides in a tightly controlled, secure data center. These investments mean that information about the identity and preferences of individual members is never accessible to anyone outside JangoMail. We will maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable information. </p>
<p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link: <a href="http://www.thawte.com/resources/ssl-information-center/get-started-with-ssl/index.html" target="_new">http://www.thawte.com/resources/ssl-information-center/get-started-with-ssl/index.html</a>. </p>
<p>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>
<p></p><h3>Widgets</h3><p></p>	
<p>
Widgets support functions that require that you disclose certain personally identifiable information, given the user’s choice of participation. This information is collected in many different ways such as: forms, surveys, contests, forums, subscribing or unsubscribing to mailings, and correcting or updating personally identifiable information and are only used for the purpose in which they were collected. Forms which require sensitive information such as financial information (credit card) to process purchases for products or services are SSL encrypted to protect your sensitive information. </p>
