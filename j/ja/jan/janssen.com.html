                            instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as "information" on the Macromedia
                            site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs
                            that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance
                            of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the
