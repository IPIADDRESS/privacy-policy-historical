      <p>We at Janata are committed to respecting your privacy and recognize your 
      need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable 
      information you share with us (any information by which you can be 
      identified, such as name, address, and telephone number). That is why Janata
      has established this privacy policy, so that you can understand the care 
      with which we intend to treat your information.</p><p>In general, you can visit
Janata without telling us who you are or 
      revealing any personal information about yourself. We track the Internet 
      address of the domains from which people visit us and analyze this data 
      for trends and statistics, but the individual user remains anonymous. 
      </p><p>Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" so that we can better serve you 
      with more tailored information when you return to our site. Cookies are 
      identifiers which a Web site can send to your browser to keep on your computer to facilitate your next visit to our site. You can 
      set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the 
      chance to decide whether or not to accept it. The information we collect 
      and analyze is used to improve our service to you. 
      </p><p>To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles: 
      </p><p><strong>INFORMATION</strong> 
      </p><p>We want to give you information about our privacy policy and assure you 
      that we take reasonable steps to see that it is followed within our 
      company. 
      </p><p><strong>CHOICE</strong> 
</p><p>There are times when we may collect personal information from you. It 
      is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we 
      intend to do with the information. You will have the option not to provide 
      the information, and in the future you will be able to "opt out" of 
      certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the 
      information we request, you can still visit most of the Janata Bank Web site, 
      but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services. 
      </p><p><strong>ACCURACY</strong> 
      </p><p>We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you 
      supply to us; we are working on tools that will allow you to review and 
      update your information in the future. 
      </p><p><strong>SECURITY</strong> 
      </p><p>We will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share 
      with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. 
      </p><p><strong>COMMITMENT</strong> 
      </p><p>We are committed to privacy and through our membership in and actively involved in and support current industry 
      initiatives to preserve individual privacy rights on the Internet. 
      Personal data privacy is a new and evolving area, and Janata Bank is evolving 
      to meet these demands. Mistakes are possible; miscommunication is 
      possible. If you have any comments or questions regarding our privacy 
      policy, please contact us at <font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA, GENEVA"><a href="mailto:jbcomp@citechco.net">jbcomp@janatabank-bd.com</a>
      </font>We will address any 
      issue to the best of our abilities. 
      </p><p>Thank you for your support of these policies and of Janata Bank.
