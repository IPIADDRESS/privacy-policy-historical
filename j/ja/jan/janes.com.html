<h1>Jane's Information Group Website Privacy Policy</h1>

If you do not wish to receive these messages please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:Info.uk@janes.com?subject=Third%20Party">Info.uk@janes.com</a> with the subject heading "Third Party" or visit our Feedback form.</p>
<p>Our employees, agents and contractors who have access to your personally identifiable information are required to protect the information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Information</strong></p>
<p>Jane's collects IP address and web site usage data information in aggregate form so that no individual user is identified. </p>
<p>Jane's uses information in aggregate form in the following ways:<br>
· To enhance and develop content and services<br>
· To aid future strategic development <br>
· To plan for the maintenance and development of system software, hardware and communications technology.<br>
· To provide advertisers with data on the number of users and usage patterns</p>
<p>
  <strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Session Cookie. </strong><br>
  When you log in or register on a Jane's web site, Jane's web servers send a string of text called a "cookie" to your browser, which stores it in its memory. The text identifies Jane's and includes a string of numbers that represent your rights to access restricted material on Jane's web sites. As your browser connects to Jane's sites, it automatically sends the cookie information back to Jane's servers so that your access rights can be determined very quickly. In addition to this, some of our services need to recall selections you have made during your session so that they display the correct information to you. In both cases, when you close your browser, this cookie information disappears. It is never written to a file on your machine.</p>
<p><strong>2. Persistent Cookie.</strong><br>
  We currently use persistent cookie on Janes.com for two purposes. The first is for pages that contain advertising, the Ad Server sends a string of text called a "cookie" to your browser, if you don't already have one. The text identifies the Ad Server and includes a unique string of characters that allow the Ad Server to recognize your browser as you visit sites that use the Ad Server's advertising software. When the Ad Server receives the cookie from your browser, it can recognize you and determine what advertisement to display. For example, the Ad Server may use your cookie to select an ad you haven't seen before, or to display an ad the advertiser only wants you to see once per week.</p>
<p>The second area is on Police Review where we use persistent cookies to prevent the re-appearance of the poll and the main entry pages, this is done to improve the user experience. If you do not accept cookies then these will always re-appear.</p>
<p><strong>Security </strong><br>
  Jane’s takes physical, electronic and managerial steps to maintain the security and accuracy of personally identifiable information we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. However, Jane’s makes no representation, warranty or guarantee that such information will remain secure and accurate at all times. In addition, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Jane’s, and you do so at your own risk. </p>
<p>Occasions will arise when customer information is passed outside Jane's to other data processors such as magazine subscription fulfilment bureaux but they will only act upon instruction from Jane's in order to perform the services required. Jane’s provides your information to such third parties solely to enable such parties to perform the services required. </p>
<p><strong>Credit checks</strong><br>
  If you are a user contracting for a fee-paying service, Jane's may in some instances carry out credit checks on you with credit reference agencies or we may request references. The fact that Jane's has carried out such a credit check, and in some instances the nature or results of the credit check, will appear on the agency's register. In many countries you can obtain a copy of your register entry by writing to the relevant credit reference agency, sometimes on payment of a fee.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer of Personal Data Overseas</strong><br>
  Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by using Jane's and communicating electronically with us you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way.</p>
<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong><br>
  Protecting children's privacy is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information from individuals we actually know are under 13, and no Jane’s web site is targeted to attract anyone under 13. We request that all visitors under 13 to a Jane’s webs site not disclose or provide any personally identifiable information. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete the child's personally identifiable information from our records.</p>
<p> <strong>Legal Requirements</strong><br>
  We may provide access to your personally identifiable information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of a Jane’s web site, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors of a Jane’s web site or the public. In those instances, the information is provided only for that purpose.</p>
  In the event Jane’s goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.<p></p>
<p><strong>Changes to this statement</strong><br>
  Due to changes in legislation and best practice or enhancements to functionality and content on Jane's we may make changes to our privacy policy and will reflect those changes in this statement, so you should check here from time to time.</p>
