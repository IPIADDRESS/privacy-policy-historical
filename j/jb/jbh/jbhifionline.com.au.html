provide, or which you choose to provide us, in relation to your job application.</p>

third parties to verify the accuracy of that information.  In such circumstances, we will disclose only such 
information as is necessary in the circumstances.</p>
<p>In considering your application, we may also collect personal information about you from any third parties that 
you nominate as your referees in your application.</p>


<h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3>
We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information that we collect, use or disclose is accurate, 
complete, up-to-date and stored in a secure environment protected from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.


<h3>How to access your Personal Information</h3>
<p>Upon your request, JB Hi-Fi will take reasonable steps to let you know, generally, what sort of personal information 
we hold, for what purposes and how we collect, use and disclose that information.</p>
<p>Upon your request, JB Hi-Fi will provide access to your personal information that we hold (except in certain 
circumstances set out in the Privacy Law).  JB Hi-Fi reserves the right to charge you an administration fee of $25 
for providing access to your personal information and will, of course, require some proof of your identify before 
providing information to you.</p>
<p>We take all reasonable precautions to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is up-to-date. 
However, the accuracy of that personal information depends to a large extent on the information you provide to us.  
To help ensure the accuracy of the personal information we hold about you, we ask that you:</p><ul>
<li>let us know if you become aware of any errors in the personal information that we hold about you;
and</li>
<li>inform us of changes to your personal information, such as changes to your name or address or
other contact details,
using the contact details set out at the end of this Statement. In addition:</li>
<li>if you are a subscriber to our mailing list you can also update your details via the "unsubscribe" option in one of the emails that you receive from us;</li>
<li>if you subscribe to one of our services such as JB Hi-Fi Now you can also update your details via that
service.</li></ul>




<h3>Additional information for purchasers of Mobile Phones</h3>
<p>When you buy a mobile phone, JB Hi-Fi will ask you to provide proof of identity details such as a Credit Card, 
Drivers License or Passport and the phone's unique identification number (IMEI) will be recorded.  In the case of 
prepaid phones which include a sim card and phones sold in conjunction with post-paid phone plans your personal 
information is collected in accordance with government regulations, as a condition of JB Hi-Fi's license as a Telstra 
dealer and for the purpose of provisioning Telstra services and accounts.  If you refuse to provide this information when 
purchasing a product of this type then JB Hi-Fi will not be able to sell it to you.</p>
<p>JB Hi-Fi also collects and retains personal information, such as your name, proof of ID reference number, date of 
birth, address and Phone IMEI number from the sale of all mobile phone handsets for the purpose of record keeping in 
accordance with its Consumer Guarantees Compliance Program (warranties regarding acceptable quality and fitness for 
purpose), including the purpose of efficient retrieval and authentication of records in the event of a warranty claims 
and product returns, for example, if you have lost your receipt. Details are also recorded in accordance with JB Hi-Fi's 
fraud and theft prevention strategies.</p>
<p>In the case of an "Outright" phone purchase, personal information is not transmitted to any telecommunications carrier 
or government agency.</p>
<p>If you are purchasing an Outright Phone (a phone without a Sim card included and that is not on a "plan") in a JB Hi-Fi 
store and do not wish to have JB Hi-Fi collect your personal information, you can advise JB Hi-Fi staff that you would like 
to purchase the Outright Phone "Anonymously". Staff will still be required to collect the phone's unique IMEI number but 
will not record any personal identity information in JB Hi-Fi's system and will record the sale as "Anonymous". Purchasing 
an outright phone anonymously means that, if you lose your receipt, JB Hi-Fi may not be able retrieve evidence of your 
proof of purchase for consumer guarantee (warranty) purposes.  Please note that you will not be able to purchase an Outright 
Phone "Anonymously" if you are purchasing online (including for pick-up in store).</p>
<p>JB Hi-Fi does not use any personal information collected during the process described above for any marketing purposes.</p>
<p>The other provisions of this Privacy Statement also apply to the purchase of mobile phones.</p>
