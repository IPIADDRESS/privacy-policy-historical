  <p>The  information Bridgevine collects about you at our websites,   and   the subdomains  thereof (the "Sites" or "Websites") is used to     administer  the Website and to provide information to Website visitors     about the Site’s  various services and tools, and to provide general     news, information,  entertainment and ecommerce capability. Bridgevine,     together with Bridgevine  partners and operators, are collectively     referred to in this Privacy Policy as  "we," "us," "our" or other     similar pronouns, or  "Bridgevine."</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>What  Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</strong><br>
    This  Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") applies to your use   of   the  Website, whether accessed through mobile or desktop     applications, or otherwise.  Â&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided herein, this      Privacy Policy does not govern Bridgevine’s treatment of information   it    collects and receives about you other than through this Website,   for   example in  connection with any other services provided to you by     Bridgevine. <br>
  <br>
    This  Privacy Policy covers how Bridgevine treats information   that   Bridgevine  collects and receives about you via this Website, or in     e-mail, text or other  electronic messages between you and the Website,     and including the personal  information we collect through the various     features, services, and software  that we use to provide the Site to     you. Â&nbsp;It does not apply to information collected by  any third party,     including through any application, feature, service, software  or     content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from     or on  the Website.Â&nbsp; If you choose to take  advantage of any third   party   offerings, you should read the privacy policies of  such third   parties.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>How  Does Bridgevine Collect and Use Information About You?</strong><br>
    The  information learned from this Website's users will help     Bridgevine provide an  enhanced online experience for its subscribers.     Bridgevine tracks certain  information about users (as further   described   below), including, but not  limited to, the type of browser   being used   by the visitor (e.g., Firefox,  Internet Explorer), the   type of   operating system (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) in  use by the   visitor and   the domain name of the visitor's Internet service    provider (e.g.,   Bridgevine Internet). By having this information, Web   pages  optimized   for a particular visitor's preferences are   automatically made  available   to that visitor. <br>
  <br>
    Personally  identifiable data (as further described below) about     visitors to this Site are  collected by Bridgevine, for example, when     users register or subscribe for  newsletters, accounts or features,     change services or service settings on our  Website, make online     purchases, enter sweepstakes and contests, complete  surveys, contribute     to a chat room, message board, blog, or other similar open  forum on     our Website, submit a comment or question to us using a "contact  us"   or   similar feature on our Website, or send us an e-mail, or in any    other   way submit personal information to us via our Website.<br>
  <br>
    We  may use your personally identifiable information to send you     notices (for  example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like),     and otherwise  correspond with you, about products, services,   companies   and events, sponsored  by us and others, that we think might   interest   you, unless you choose to  opt-out of these mailings (as   described   below).<br>
  <br>
    Bridgevine  sites (other than this Site), as well as any other     third party sites linked to  from this Site, may each have different     privacy policies and practices.  Bridgevine is not responsible for the     information practices of non-Bridgevine  sites, or channels or areas of     this Site, that are operated by third parties.  You should carefully     review these other privacy policies in order to determine  how each     third party may use any personal information you provide.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Choice/Opt-Out</strong><br>
    Bridgevine  does send product marketing e-mail. We use your   e-mail   address which may be  entered for service qualifying order   placement   or via other email capture  methods. Any e-mail communication   that you   receive from Bridgevine, contains a  prominent "Opt Out" link   in the   body of the e-mail. By clicking on  the "Opt Out" link, you will   have   removed your e-mail address from  our mailing list, and you will   not   receive any further product marketing  communications from   Bridgevine. <br>
  <br>
    This  site gives users the following options for notifying     Bridgevine of their choice  not to receive future communications from us     or our partners; or to no longer  receive our service. </p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>You can send email to       remove@Bridgevine.com.<br>
      Please note that email must be sent from the email of record on the       account. <br>
      <br>

      Vero Beach, FL 32960 </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Here  are the types of information Bridgevine gathers and how this information is  used:</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Website  Usage Information</strong><br>
    Bridgevine  receives and stores certain types of website usage     information whenever you  interact with and navigate through our     Website.Â&nbsp;Here are the types of  website usage information Bridgevine     gathers and how it is used.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
    We  may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information     about  you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser     or related  software from a Web server and stored on your computer's     hard drive. Cookies  track where you travel on our Web site and what you     look at and purchase. They  may store, for example, the information   in   your shopping cart, and/or your  username and/or password. All of   these   purposes serve to improve and  personalize your experience on   our   Website.<br>
  <br>
    Most  Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been     sent to you and  provide you with the opportunity to refuse that   cookie.   Additionally, if you  have a Flash player installed on your   computer,   your Flash player can be set to  reject or delete Flash   cookies   (technically known as Flash “local shared  objects”). However,   refusing a   cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from  using, or   negatively   impact the display or function of, the Web site or certain    areas or   features of the Web site.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Clear  GIFs</strong><br>
    We  may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel  tags") or     similar technologies, in the Website and/or in our  communications with     you, for example, to enable us to know whether you have  visited a Web     page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel,      transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located     on a  Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is     retrieved from a  remote site on the Internet enabling the verification     of an individual's  viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>IP  Address and Clickstream Data</strong><br>
    Our  server automatically collects data about your server's Internet     address when  you visit us. This information, known as an Internet     Protocol address, or IP  Address, is a number that's automatically     assigned to your computer by your  Internet service provider (i.e., if     you are using your TWC Internet account,  us) whenever you're on the     Internet. When you request pages from our Website,  our servers may log     your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server  may also     record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another site or    a   search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the site you   visit   after  this Website; the ads you see and/or click on; other   information   about the type  of Web browser, computer, platform,   related software   and settings you are  using; any search terms you   have entered on this   Website or a referral site;  and other Web usage   activity and data   logged by our Web servers. We use this  information   for internal system   administration, to help diagnose problems with    our server, and to   administer our Website. Such information may also   be used to  gather   broad demographic information, such as country of   origin and Internet    Service Provider.<br>
  <br>
    Ads  and Content displayed to you on the Site may be customized to     your interests  and preferences, based on your personal information and     web site usage  information, including (but not limited to)     non-personally identifying  information, which we may obtain from you or     from other sources.<br>
  <br>
    Any  or all of these activities with regard to web site usage     Information may be  performed on our behalf by our services providers.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Short  Message Service</strong><br>
    We  may make available a service through which you can receive     messages on your  wireless device via short message service (“SMS     Service”). If you subscribe to  one of our SMS Services, you thereby     agree to receive SMS Service messages at  the address you provide for     such purposes from Bridgevine.<br>
  <br>
    Your  wireless carrier’s standard rates apply to these messages, and     you may change  your mind at any time by following the instructions   on   the Site or in the  message you receive. You represent that you are   the   owner or authorized user of  the wireless device you use to sign   up for   the SMS Service, and that you are  authorized to approve the   applicable   charges. To use the SMS Service, you must  be 18 years of   age or older   and reside in the United States. You must first  register   and provide   all required Personal Information, which may include, for    example, your   name, SMS address, wireless carrier and, if fees are   applicable  to the   SMS Service you subscribe to, billing information   (either your credit    card information or mobile service carrier   information if applicable   fees will  be billed through your carrier).   We may also obtain the date,   time and content  of your messages in the   course of your use of the SMS   Service. We will use the  information   we obtain in connection with our   SMS Service in accordance with  this   Privacy Policy. If fees are charged   to your wireless account invoice,   we  may provide your carrier with   your applicable information in   connection  therewith. Your wireless   carrier and other service   providers may also collect  data about your   wireless device usage, and   their practices are governed by  their own   policies.<br>
  <br>
    You  acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via     wireless systems  which use radios (and other means) to transmit     communications over complex  networks. We do not guarantee that your use     of the SMS Service will be private  or secure, and we are not liable   to   you for any lack of privacy or security you  may experience. You   are   fully responsible for taking precautions and providing  security     measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS      Service. We may also access the content of your account and/or wireless     account  with your carrier for the purpose of identifying and   resolving   technical  problems and/or service-related complaints.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Third  Party Ad Services and Providers</strong><br>
    We  may use third-party advertising services companies to serve ads     when you visit  our Website. These companies may use information     (generally not including your  name, address email address or telephone     number) about your visits to this Site  and other sites in order to     provide advertisements about goods and services of  interest to you.     These companies may employ cookies and clear gifs to measure      advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties     collect via  cookies and clear GIFs is generally not personally     identifiable (unless, for  example, you provide personally identifiable     information to them through an ad  or e-mail message). We encourage   you   to read these businesses' privacy policies  if you should have any     concerns about how they will care for your personal  information. Â&nbsp;We   do   not control these  third parties’ tracking technologies or how   they may   be used.Â&nbsp; If you would like more information about this    practice and   to know your choices about not having this information   used by  these   companies, see the Network Advertising Initiative's   consumer Web site at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising</a>.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Personal  Information</strong><br>
    Bridgevine  also receives and stores information that may personally     identify you. Visitors  to the Website who decide to register or   login   to timewarnercable.com in order  to request a more personalized   Website   experience, or accept any of the various  promotions and other   product   or service offerings (i.e., security downloads)  that may be   made   available on the Website from time to time, may be asked to    enter   certain types of personally identifiable information that will   allow    Bridgevine to provide those promotions and offerings to the   visitor. The   types  of personally identifiable information that may be   collected   include: name,  postal address, email address and phone   number;   Bridgevine account number, CPNI  customer code, Website login,   user ID   and/or password information; social  security number; short   message   service or text message address or other  wireless device   address;   instant messaging address; credit card or other  payment   information;   demographic information and/or other information that may    identify you   as an individual or allow online or offline contact   with you as an    individual. Certain other information collected, such   as security   questions,  may be used by Bridgevine to verify your   identity in the   event that you lose or  forget your Website login   credentials.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Does  Bridgevine Ever Share Information with Other Parties?</strong><br>
    Disclosure  of Information to Outside Parties:<br>
    Bridgevine  will not disclose information about you to any other     party except under the  circumstances as described below, or as     otherwise provided in this Privacy  Policy or required or permitted by     law:<br>
  <br>
    Unless  you opt-out, we may share your personally identifiable     information with third  parties (such as co-sponsors of our sweepstakes,     contests and other offerings).<br>
  <br>
    Bridgevine  may share your information with its affiliates, service     providers and other  third parties that help to operate our business   and   this Website and deliver  the products and services available on   or   through the Website. <br>
  <br>
    When  you contribute to a "public" area or feature of our Website,     such as  a chat room, bulletin board, blog or other open forum that we     may make  available on or through our Website, the information that   you   submit will be  made available to other users. For this reason, we     recommend that you not  submit any sensitive information on these   areas   of the Site, including your  full name, home address, phone   number,   financial information, or other  information that would enable   users to   locate you.<br>
  <br>
    Bridgevine  provides your information to trusted partners who work     on behalf of or with  Bridgevine and under confidentiality agreements   to   assist in order and rebate  fulfillment, and for other purposes to     assist Bridgevine. However, these  companies do not have any   independent   right to use, sell or share this  information. <br>
  <br>
    When  Bridgevine believes it should, it will respond to subpoenas,     court orders,  legal process, and to establish or exercise Bridgevine’s     legal rights or defend  against legal claims.<br>
  <br>
    Bridgevine  shares information in order to investigate, prevent or     take action regarding  illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations     involving potential threats to Bridgevine’s  property or the physical     safety of any person, violations of Bridgevine’s terms  of use or as     otherwise allowed by law.<br>
  <br>
    In  the event that Bridgevine, or any affiliated entity, or     substantially all of  its assets related to a particular geographical     region, are acquired by one or  more third parties as a result of an     acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization,  consolidation or     liquidation, user information may be one of the transferred  assets.<br>
  <br>
    Bridgevine  may disclose your information in any other way we may describe when you provide  the information.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Security</strong><br>
    Bridgevine  will take steps to protect the security and integrity of     all sensitive  information provided to this Site. However, due to the     inherent nature of the  Internet as an open global communications     vehicle, we cannot guarantee that  information, during transmission     through the Internet or while stored on our  system or otherwise in our     care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as  hackers.Â&nbsp; Any     transmission of personal  information is at your own risk.Â&nbsp; We are  not     responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security     measures  contained on the Website.<br>
  <br>
    You  are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of     your account  password and any Website login or user ID information,   and   you shall be  responsible for any access to or use of the Site by   you   or any person or entity  using your password, login or user ID,   whether   or not such access or use has  been authorized by or on behalf   of you.Â&nbsp;    We urge you to be careful about giving out information in   public areas    of the Website.<br>
  <br>
    In  the event that we believe that the security of your Personal     Information in our  possession or control may have been compromised, we     may seek to notify you of  that development. If a notification is     appropriate, we would endeavor to do so  as promptly as possible under     the circumstances, and, to the extent we have  your e-mail address, we     may notify you by e-mail.<br>
    Bridgevine  online products and services and applications are for   the   sole use of  Bridgevine customers in managing their accounts and   the   products and services  they receive. If you choose to provide   access to   certain of your account data  to third parties Bridgevine   cannot be held   responsible for any release of  account or personal   data that occurs as   a result of such transmissions or  access that you   provide to others.</p>

  <strong>Do  Not Call List Information</strong><br>
    Effective  October 3, 2003, new telemarketing rules went into effect     as promulgated by the  Federal Trade Commission for the National Do   Not   Call Registry. If the person  has not made a previous request, an     outbound telemarketing call still may not  be made if the person's     number is on the "do-not-call" registry. 16  C.F.R. 310(b)(1)(iii)(B).     There are two exceptions to the prohibition against  calling a person   on   the "do-not-call" registry: (1) express  agreement, in writing,     including the telephone number to which calls may be  placed and the     signature of that person (which may include an electronic or  digital     signature), 16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(B)(i); (2) the seller has an      "established business relationship" with the person and the person  has     not previously made a specific objection to receiving a call by or on      behalf of the seller.<br>
  <br>
    The FTC rules further define an "established business relationship"      as including a "relationship between a seller and a consumer based   on:â€¦    (2) the consumer's inquiry or application regarding a product or     service  offered by the seller, within the three (3) months   immediately   preceding the  date of a telemarketing call." 16 C.F.R.   310.2(n)(2). <br>
  <br>
    A seller cannot call a person who has "previously stated that he or     she  does not wish to receive an outbound telephone call made by or on     behalf of the  seller whose goods or services are being offered." 16     C.F.R.  310.4(b)(1)(iii)(A). <br>
