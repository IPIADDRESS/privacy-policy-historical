  <h2> Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p> JSTOR is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of its website. 
    To better inform you of our policy concerning user privacy, we have adopted 
    the following guidelines. Please note that these guidelines are subject to 
    change, and any such changes will be included on this page. 
 
  </p><h4>The Information JSTOR Collects</h4>
  <div class="content-indent"><p>To facilitate your access to the JSTOR archive, we may collect 
    personally identifiable information, including your name, address (including 
    your Internet Protocol address and email address), and, where applicable, 
    username and password.</p>
    <p>
    We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such 
    as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), 
    the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows 2000 or Mac OS), 
    and the domain name of your Internet service provider. We also require users 
    to agree to our <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>. </p></div>
  
  <h4>Use of the Information</h4>
  <div class="content-indent"> We use the information you provide to facilitate your use of the 
    JSTOR archive, to respond to your inquiries about JSTOR, to improve the design 
    of our site, for system administration and troubleshooting purposes, to enable 
    us to respond to uses of the JSTOR archive in violation of the JSTOR <a href="terms.html">Terms 
    and Conditions of Use</a>, and to, in aggregated form, track and analyze site 
    usage. </div>
 
  <h4>JSTOR'S Use of Cookies</h4>
  <div class="content-indent"> JSTOR employs "cookie" technology. Cookies are small 
    pieces of text that are stored on your computer and act as a tool for controlling 
    certain system variables and storing system configuration information in the 
    WWW environment. JSTOR uses cookies to store user preferences for viewing 
    and printing and to store authentication information. No personal information 
    is extracted in the cookie setting process, and we do not use cookies to identify 
    what other sites or pages you have visited. We do not involve advertisers, 
    who may place a cookie on your browser, in the operation of our site. For 
    further information, please see <a href="cookies.html">JSTOR's Use of Cookies</a>. 
  </div>
 
  <h4>Security</h4>
  <div class="content-indent"> We have appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial measures 
    in place to prevent unauthorized access to the information we collect online. 
    We do not, however, claim any responsibility for information collected by 
    or from websites linking to or from JSTOR. </div>
 
  <h4>Sharing Information</h4>
  <div class="content-indent"> Except in special circumstances, outlined below in Compliance With 
    Legal Proceedings, JSTOR does not share personal information about individual 
    users. JSTOR does share general usage data in aggregated form so that no personal 
    information is identifiable to participating libraries, publishers, and the 
    general public. JSTOR will provide you all of your personal information provided 
    at registration (where applicable) on request. </div>

  <h4>Compliance With Legal Proceedings</h4>
  <div class="content-indent"> JSTOR may disclose personal information if required to do so by 
    law or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply 
    with the law or a legal proceeding, to protect against violations of our <a href="terms.html">Terms 
    and Conditions of Use</a>, or to protect and defend our rights and property 
    or the rights and property of contributors to the JSTOR archive. </div>
 
  <h4>Opting Out</h4>
  <div class="content-indent"> JSTOR will remove you and your personal information from our database 
    on request. Please note that this may cancel your access to the JSTOR archive.
