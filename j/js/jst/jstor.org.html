<p class="content-indent">We use the information collected to enable your use of the JSTOR archive; to facilitate the Publisher Sales Service; to respond to your inquiries; for system administration, customer support, and troubleshooting purposes; for targeted marketing and product service announcements (directed at institutional participation in JSTOR or services of our related organizations); for sending newsletters (also directed at institutional participation in JSTOR); to improve the design of our website; to enable us to enforce our <a href="/about/terms.html">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>; and in aggregate form, to track and analyze site usage.</p>

<h4>Use of Cookies</h4>
  <p class="content-indent">JSTOR employs "cookie" technology, although not in connection

</li>
<li>with service providers with whom we have entered into agreements to assist us with our business operations;
</li>
<li>other third parties, such as an institution with which you are affiliated or with one of our related organization whose services you may be interested in, where you explicitly consent to our sharing your information.
</li></ul>
