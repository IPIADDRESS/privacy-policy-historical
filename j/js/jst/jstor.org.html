<h4>The Information ITHAKA Collects</h4>
<p>The personal information that ITHAKA collects will depend on how you are using ITHAKA Websites. To enable your access to the JSTOR and Portico services through your library or institution, we may collect information concerning the institution’s internet protocol address, your username and password, or other authentication methods, such as Shibboleth. To facilitate your order through the Publisher Sales Service (a service through the JSTOR archive that facilitates the purchase of articles from publishers), the Current Scholarship Program, and Individual Access, as well as your purchase of ITHAKA and its services’ brand merchandise, we collect your name, postal address, email address and transactional information. We collect but do not store your credit card details through a third party service provider. In connection with your creation of a MyJSTOR and/or a JSTOR Global Plants MyPLANTS (“MyPlants”) account, we collect your name, email address, username, and password, as well as other information you may provide. We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac), and the domain name of your Internet service provider. In addition, we may collect personally identifiable information through correspondence you send to us through optional surveys we may post on ITHAKA Websites, and in connection with statements you may post on any ITHAKA-related page on social networking sites. Please note that in some instances, Ithaka S+R may be contracted to provide services to third parties which may involve collecting your personally identifiable information. In such cases, the privacy policy governing the collection of your personally identifiable information shall be as set forth in such third parties’ privacy policies. However, unless you provide us or organizations with which we conduct business with personally identifiable information, you remain anonymous to us other than by association with an internet protocol address or other authentication mechanism.</p>
<p>ITHAKA does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If it is discovered that we have collected PII from someone under 13 we will delete that information immediately.</p>
<h4>Data Integrity; Use of the Information</h4>
<p>We use the personal information collected in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was intended to be used: to enable your use of ITHAKA Websites and ITHAKA's services; to facilitate the Publisher Sales Service; to create your MYJSTOR and/or a MyPlants account; to facilitate your purchase of ITHAKA-branded merchandise; to respond to your inquiries; for system administration, customer support, and troubleshooting purposes; and product service announcements; for sending newsletters; to improve the design of ITHAKA Websites; to enable us to enforce our <a href="http://www.jstor.org/page/info/about/policies/terms.jsp" target="new">JSTOR Terms and Conditions of Use</a> and the <a href="http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/terms-of-use" target="new">Portico Terms and Conditions of Use</a>; and in aggregate form, to track and analyze site usage. Further, in connection with postings you may make that are available to the general public on any ITHAKA-related page on social networking sites, including but not limited to statements made on the JSTOR page on Facebook and on Twitter, we may use your name, statement, comment, and affiliation in conference presentations, ITHAKA's (including JSTOR's and Portico's') newsletters, and marketing and announcement materials. ITHAKA will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

<h3 class="h4">Onward Transfer of Information</h3>
<p>ITHAKA may work with other organizations that provide specific services for us, such as credit card processing. We will provide only the personal information necessary for the third party to provide these services for us. These organizations may not use personal information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
<p>ITHAKA may also transfer personally identifiable information to third parties, such as applicable publishers, other content providers, and libraries, who can better assist with your inquiries, to facilitate order fulfillment for the Current Scholarship Program, and to enable them to inform users of services provided by ITHAKA and/or the third parties' products and services that may be of interest. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate security measures.</p>
<p>ITHAKA does not sell or share personal information about or the purchasing history of individual users, except as set forth above and in the following circumstances:</p>
<span style="line-height: 1.231;"></span> 
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">if required to do so by law or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with the law or a legal proceeding; to protect against violations of our Terms and Conditions of Use; or to protect and defend our rights and property or the rights and property of rights holders whose content is made available through ITHAKA Websites;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><br>

<li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">with service providers with whom we have entered into agreements to assist us with our business operations;</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">if ITHAKA is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information;</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If Ithaka S+R is contracted to provide services to third parties that involve collecting your personally identifiable information, the privacy policy governing the collection of your personally identifiable information shall be as set forth in such third parties' privacy policies; and</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">if you are accessing JSTOR through a token provided by your institution, on request from the institution solely for user verification purposes by the institution that provided the token; and o</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">ther third parties, such as an institution with which you are affiliated, where you explicitly consent to our sharing your information.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, ITHAKA shares general usage data in aggregated form so that no personal information is identifiable to participating institutions, content providers, researchers, and the general public. ITHAKA will provide you all of your retained personal information provided at registration (where applicable) on request.</p>

<p>By using ITHAKA Websites, you consent to the collection and use, in accordance with this policy, of the information you provide to us. We will remove you and your personally identifiable information from our records or refrain from using your personally identifiable information in connection with certain services on request if you contact us with your request at <a href="mailto:privacy@ithaka.org" target="new">privacy@ithaka.org</a>.

</p>
<p>You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ithaka.org" target="new">privacy@ithaka.org</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Security</h3>
<p>We protect your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure through the use of passwords, physical security measures, managerial measures, and (in connection with credit card information for order sales through the Publisher Sales Service, Current Scholarship Program, Individual Access, and for purchase of ITHAKA and its services' brand merchandise) encryption through our third party service providers. We nonetheless recognize that third parties may obtain access to information through unlawful actions, and thus do not promise that your information always will remain private, despite our efforts and the importance we place on maintaining your privacy. In addition, we do not claim any responsibility for information collected by or from websites linking to or from ITHAKA Websites.</p>
<p>In the event that we discover or are notified of a security breach where personal information is at risk, we will notify you electronically if we have your email address. If you do not wish to be notified via email in the event of a breach, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ithaka.org">privacy@ithaka.org</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Access and Correction</h3>
<p>If you would like to review, delete or update your information, you may contact us using the contact information below. We will take reasonable steps to permit you to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate. Please note, because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete or amend your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.</p>
<p>You will need to provide sufficient identifying information, such as your name and email address and possible additional identifying information as a security precaution. We may limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Data Retention</h3>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ithaka.org">privacy@ithaka.org</a>. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Email Citations</h3>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to send a citation to a friend, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. ITHAKA stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</p>
<p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ithaka.org">privacy@ithaka.org</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Enforcement and Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>We engage in periodic self-assessment to ensure compliance with our Privacy Policy. We verify that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact information below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this policy.</p>
<p>Any claim arising out of or relating to our adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles, or the breach thereof, that cannot be resolved through our internal processes will be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its applicable commercial rules. Any arbitrator will be either an attorney or retired judge having significant and recognized experience with and knowledge of privacy issues and information technology. The arbitration panel should apply New York law, without regard to its conflict of laws principles, as well as the Safe Harbor Enforcement Principles issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce (<a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018475.asp">http://export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018475.asp</a>). In addition, the exclusive location for such arbitration will be New York, New York. All decisions of the arbitration panel will be final and binding on the parties, which waive any right to further appeal the arbitration award, to the extent an appeal may be lawfully waived.</p>
<p>As a not-for-profit organization, we are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Trade Commission, which oversees the implementation of Safe Harbor Principles; however, we agree to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles in recognition of their importance in ensuring the protection of user information.</p>
<h3 class="h4">Notification of Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any change in how we use your personal information we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
