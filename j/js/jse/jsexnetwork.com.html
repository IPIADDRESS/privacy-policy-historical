      <p class="go">Last Updated: May 30, 2004</p>
      <p class="go">At JSexNetwork.com we understand and believe that your personal 
        information is of high importance. You should be able to choose what information 
        you want to share and what is not. The policies below are applicable to 
        JSexNetwork.com and its subdomains on the World Wide Web. Please read 
        the following carefully: </p>
      <p class="go"><b>General Information on Collection and Use</b><br>
        Anyone over the age of 18 years old can visit any of the JSexNetwork.com 
        web sites without disclosing who they are or revealing any personal information 
        about themselves. At JSexNetwork.com, we only track the Internet addresses 
        of the individuals who visit our site to analyze trends, and traffic and 
        only track user's movement within the site to gather broad demographic 
        information. The data we gather is not linked in any way to individual 
        personally identifiable information. The information we collect is mainly 
        for our own marketing strategy in understanding the main demographics 
        of our most popular region of visitors and not individual visitors. All 
        information is confidential and will never be sold or disclosed to a third 
        party.</p>
      <p class="go"><b>Encrypted Credit Card Purchases</b><br>
        When you use a credit card to purchase a JSexNetwork.com subscription, 
        the credit card number is encrypted as it passes over the Internet. Your 
        credit card number is not kept or recorded on our computers - it is simply 
        passed through to the credit card company to purchase the subscription. 
        In addition, we are sensitive to the fact that some users are uncomfortable 
        submitting their credit card number over the Internet, no matter how secure 
        the environment. </p>
      <p class="go"><b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
        At JSexNetwork.com Corporation when we make any changes to our privacy policy, we 
        will post the changes on our site so you are always aware of what information 
        we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, how we disclose 
        it. If at any point we decide to use our customer's personally identifiable 
        information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was 
        collected, we would notify you via email. You will have a choice as to 
        whether or not we use your information in this different manner. </p>
      <p class="go"><b>Cookies</b><br>
        JSexNetwork.com does not use cookies. A cookie is a small text file, stored 
        in memory on your computer that can be read by our system when you return 
        to our site. The cookies are encrypted and are used to keep track of you 
        as you move through our site. Cookies provide you the ability to re-enter 
        a page without retyping your password and the ability to return directly 
        to your last accessed page in any form for a specific, predetermined period 
        of time. While cookies allow you ease of use by entering your Password 
        less frequently, there are no functional differences if the site is accessed 
        and used with the cookies disabled. </p>
      <p class="go"><b>Disclosure</b><br>
        JSexNetwork.com will not sell, rent, trade, or disclose individual Customer 
        information to any third parties or outside companies who will use the 
        information to contact you or who will share the information with others 
        without your permission. It may be necessary to disclose information in 
        special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information 
        is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal actions against someone 
        who may be violating JSexNetwork.com policies or may be causing injury 
        to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the 
        rights or property of JSexNetwork.com. JSexNetwork.com may disclose or 
        allow access account information when we believe in good faith that the 
        law requires it or for administrative and other purposes that we deem 
        necessary to maintain, service, and improve our services. </p>
      <p class="go"><b>Use of Information</b><br>
        At JSexNetwork.com, we only keep a record of the subscribing members e-mail 
        addresses and adresses for only 30 days after the expiration of their 
        subscription membership. All information is discarded and permanently 
        purged after 30 days after expiration.</p>
      <p class="go"><b>Member E-mails</b><br>
        JSexNetwork.com has a strict regulation towards disclosing client email 
        content to others unless required by a lawful agency or through by interference 
        to our products and services due to the client. Our strict privacy statement 
        is enforced by all our supporting staff.</p>
