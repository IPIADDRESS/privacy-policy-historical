<h3 class="u-text-blue font-16">How We Use Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are little files that websites put on your device to make visits quicker, easier and more relevant. Some cookies are essential for websites to work and others remember things about you to give you a better experience online.</p>
<p>We have placed cookies on your computer already to help us give you the experience you expect. By continuing to use our website, you’re agreeing to our use of cookies.</p>

<h3 class="u-text-blue font-16">Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>

<p>We may share your data with third parties where necessary to fulfil or administer your policy. In the event that third parties deliver the relevant service, for example, if you take out an insurance policy underwritten by a third party, a claims company will need your details in order to process any claims.</p>


<h3 class="u-text-blue font-16">Cross-border Transfers of Information</h3>

<p>Please note that we provide products and services for customers who may travel outside the European Economic Area (EAA). Therefore if you travel on such holidays, and it is deemed necessary to provide the cover you have purchased, for example in the event of a medical claim, the information you provide may occasionally be transferred outside the European Economic Area. It is worth noting however that some non-EEA countries do not afford the same level of data security as the UK. By submitting your details, you consent to this transfer in the event that it is necessary to process your claim. We will always use every reasonable effort to ensure sufficient protections are in place to safeguard your personal information.</p>

<p>We may also be obliged by law to pass on your information to the Police or any other statutory authority.</p>
