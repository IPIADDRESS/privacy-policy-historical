<td>J&amp;G Sales observes strict privacy measures to protect the information
provided to us by our customers. We never sell, loan, give, or divulge
the names addresses, or other personal information given to us by customers
to any third party.&nbsp; We would only divulge customer personal information
when presented with a properly authorized and legal request by law enforcement
and/or the justice courts. This applies to information provided via internet,
phone, mail, or through in person purchases.
<p>The information is kept strictly in our customer files and is used only to 
process the orders and requests of the customers. The address information is 
used to send our seasonal J&amp;G Sales catalog. The phone number or email address 
is only used to contact you if there is some need related to a pending order or 
business transaction. Your email address is used to send you notices of sale 
items and featured products only if you sign up to voluntarily receive these 
notices. You can unsubscribe at any time from these email notices by following 
the instructions at the bottom of our email newsletter.</p><p>Data that is stored on our computer servers is protected both physically
in well-secured and monitored structures, and electronically with up to
date firewall protection.&nbsp;
</p><p>In some instances we need to know your date of birth, this is used and
kept as a statement by you that you are of proper age to purchase products
like ammunition, which is restricted to underage buyers.
</p><p>Our website uses a cookie in order to make the shopping cart function.
The cookie is used for no other reason. We do not have third party advertisers
or banner ads on our website, so no other cookies are used by our website.
</p><p>The BATF paperwork related to firearms sales is required to be kept
for 20 years.&nbsp; These forms are stored at J&amp;G Sales during these
20 years. The BATF is permitted to view these records during the routine
audits that every FFL dealer undergoes periodically, and if the information is 
properly requested due to an authorized trace.</p></td>
