                This policy only applies to the j2 Global corporate Web site (
                <a href="http://www.j2global.com">www.j2global.com</a>

              <p class="middle">Because j2 Global wants to demonstrate its
                commitment to our visitors' privacy, in this Privacy Policy we
                are disclosing:</p>
              <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

              <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Information Collection</div>
              <p>j2 Global collects information from visitors to the
                j2global.com Web site through the use of cookies, log files and
                clear gifs as well as information provided by visitors through
                the Partner, Investor, Press and Contact portions of the Web
                site.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Cookies</div>
              <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the visitor's
                computer tied to information about the visitor. Usage of a
                cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable
                information while on our site. We may use both session ID
                cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once
                visitors close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A
                persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the visitor's
                hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies
                enable us to track and target the interests of our visitors to
                enhance the experience on our site. See the "Profile"
                section, below. Persistent cookies can be removed by following
                Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable
                cookies in your browser, you can still access most of the
                j2global.com Web site. However, some areas of the Web site may
                not allow you to complete certain activities if cookies are
                disabled. We can only read cookies from j2 Global Web sites.</p>
              <p>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our Web
                site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to
                or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for
                them to set cookies for advertising. This Privacy Policy covers
                the use of cookies by the j2global.com Web site only and does
                not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Profile</div>
              <p>We may store information that we collect through cookies,
                log files and third parties to create a profile of our visitors.
                A profile may store information that we keep on individual
                visitors that details their viewing preferences. Consequently,
                collected information is tied to the visitor's personally
                identifiable information to provide offers and improve the
                content of the site for the visitor. This profile may be used to
                tailor a visitor's visit to the j2global Web site, and to direct
                pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share
                personally identifiable elements of your profile with other
                third parties. Your profile is shared in aggregate form only.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Log Files</div>
              <p>Like most Web sites, our servers use log files to analyze
                trends, administer the site, track visitor's movement in the
                aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for
                aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally
                identifiable information.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Clear Gifs</div>
              <p>Clear gifs, or Web beacons, are tiny graphics with a
                unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and we may
                use them to track the online movements of visitors to the
                j2global.com Web site. Clear gifs are invisible on the page and
                are much smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at
                the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to visitors'
                personally identifiable information.</p>
              <p>We may place Web beacons on some pages to allow us to
                compile anonymous, aggregated statistics about web site usage.
                We also may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us
                know which emails (or particular articles, links, etc.) have
                been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the
                effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of
                our marketing campaigns.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Information Use</div>
              <p>This information is used in the following ways:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Customer Feedback and Support. Provides a mechanism for
                  requesting information from j2 Global. Also used to tell us how
                  we can improve our products, services and Web site designs.</li>
                <li>Email Correspondence. Used to raise and respond to
                  issues and inquiries of all types. Also used to distribute
                  information about j2 Global, our products, and services.</li>
                <li>Partner, Investor Relations, Press and Sales. Used to
                  distribute requested information about j2 Global and to
                  establish contact with appropriate j2 Global personnel.</li>
                <li>As set out in the section of this Privacy Policy
                  entitled "Sharing."</li>
                <li>If you submit your resume as a prospective employee, j2
                  Global will use your personal information for recruitment
                  purposes, and if you are offered a job or become employed by j2
                  Global, for other employment-related purposes.</li>
              </ol>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Third Party Advertising</div>
              <p>We may from time-to-time have third party advertising on
                our j2global.com Web site. In that case, the ads appearing would
                be delivered to visitors through the third party advertising
                partners. Information about your visits to our Web site, such as
                number of times you have viewed an ad (but not user name,
                address, or other personal information), may be used to serve
                ads to you on the Web site. Third party advertising partners do
                not have access to personally identifiable information.</p>
              <p>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the
                j2global.com Web site only and does not cover the use of cookies
                by any advertisers.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Children's Privacy</div>
              <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from
                children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal
                information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that
                information from our systems. j2 Global encourages parents to go
                online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a
                child's online experience safer:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Teach kids never to give personal information, unless
                  supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name,
                  address, phone, school, etc.</li>
                <li>Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites
                  are appropriate.</li>
                <li>Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your
                  child's information is treated.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>Communications from the Site</h2>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Alerts and Other
                Communications</div>
              <p>While visiting the j2global.com Web site, you have the
                option to subscribe to various news and other alerts. Each such
                communication has instructions on how to unsubscribe. In

                or to request other information regarding our products or
                services. We will respond to such requests as appropriate.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Sharing</div>
              <p>We do not share information obtained from visitors to the
                j2global.com Web site except as otherwise specifically set forth
                in this Privacy Policy.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Legal Disclaimer</div>
              <p>Though we make every effort to preserve visitor privacy,
                we may need to disclose personal information when required by
                law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is
                necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court
                order, legal process served on our Web site, or in order to
                investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activity.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Aggregate Information
                (non-personally identifiable)</div>
              <p>We may share aggregated demographic information with our
                partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally
                identifiable information.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Third Party Intermediaries</div>
              <p>We may use third parties to host certain portions of the
                j2global.com Web site and to fulfill certain requests for
                information from visitors to the site. These companies do not
                retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information
                for any secondary purposes.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Business Transactions</div>
              <p>In the event j2 Global goes through a business transition,
                such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling
                a portion of its assets, visitors' personal information will, in
                most instances, be part of the assets transferred. You will be
                notified prior to a change of ownership or control of your
                personal information. If as a result of the business transition,
                your personally identifiable information will be used in a
                manner different from that stated at the time of collection you
                will be given a choice not to have your information used in this
                different manner, as described in the notification of changes
                section, below.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Links</div>
              <p>The j2global.com Web site contains links to other sites.
                Please be aware that j2 Global is not responsible for the
                privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be
                aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements
                of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable
                information, including j2 Global's other Web sites. This Privacy
                Policy applies solely to information collected by j2 Global
                through the j2global.com Web site. j2 Global has advertising and
                affiliate relationships with dozens of third party sites which
                drive interested parties to our sites. Information that is
                collected on these sites does not fall within the auspices of
                this Policy. j2 Global has Co-Brand relationships with some Web
                sites. A site is a Co-Brand of j2 Global if it offers j2 Global
                technology or services to its users under a different brand. The
                Co-Branded sites will have their own privacy policies specific
                to each site, and the user should read them carefully before
                registration.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Security</div>
              <p>j2 Global takes every reasonable precaution to protect
                visitors' information. When visitors submit sensitive
                information via the j2global.com Web site, their information is
                protected both online and off-line.</p>
              <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive
                information online, we also employ security measures to protect
                visitor-information off-line. All of our visitors' information,
                not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is
                restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the
                information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing
                clerks or a customer service representative) are granted access
                to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers
                that store personally identifiable information are in a secure
                environment.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating
                Personal Information</div>
              <p>If a visitor's personally identifiable information changes
                (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a
                visitor no longer desires to receive previously-requested
                information from j2 Global, the visitor can generally correct,
                update or delete/deactivate visitors' personally identifiable
                information by opting out of requested communications or
                contacting appropriate j2 Global personnel via the j2global.com
                Web site.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Notification of Changes</div>
              <p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post
                those changes in this Privacy Policy, and other places we deem
                appropriate, so visitors to the j2global.com Web site are always
                aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
                what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use
                information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which
                the information was collected. In some cases we will also email
                visitors, who have opted to receive communications from us,
                notifying them of the changes in our Privacy Policy.</p>
              <p>If, however, we are going to use visitors' personally
                identifiable information in a manner different from that stated
                at the time of collection we will notify visitors via email.
                Visitors will have a choice as to whether or not we use their
                information in this different manner.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Safe Harbor</div>
              <p>j2 Global is a participant in the Safe Harbor program
                developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European
                Union. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor
                Privacy Principles agreed upon by the U.S. and the E.U. For more
                information about the Safe Harbor and to view our certification,
                visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Web site. In
                the event that any dispute arising out of or related to this
                policy is not settled by the parties, the parties will attempt
                in good faith to resolve such dispute by non-binding mediation
                in accordance with the American Arbitration Association
                Commercial Mediation Rules. No litigation for the resolution of
                such dispute may be commenced until the parties try in good
                faith to settle the dispute by such mediation in accordance with
                such rules and either party has concluded in good faith that
                amicable resolution through continued mediation of the matter
                does not appear likely. The parties to the mediation shall share
                the costs of mediation equally. Any settlement reached by
                mediation shall be recorded in writing, signed by the parties,
                and shall be binding on them.</p>
              <div class="subSectionTitle">Data Retention</div>
              <p>The time period for which we keep information varies
                according to what the information is used for. In some cases,
                there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period.
                Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the
                information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary
                for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which
                it is to be further processed.</p>
