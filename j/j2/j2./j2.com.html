Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once visitors close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the visitor's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our visitors to enhance the experience on our site. See the "Profile" section, below. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you can still access most of the j2global.com Web site. However, some areas of the Web site may not allow you to complete certain activities if cookies are disabled. We can only read cookies from j2 Global Web sites.</p> <p>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our Web site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the j2global.com Web site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Profile</div> <p>We may store information that we collect through cookies, log files and third parties to create a profile of our visitors. A profile may store information that we keep on individual visitors that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the visitor's personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the visitor. This profile may be used to tailor a visitor's visit to the j2global Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share personally identifiable elements of your profile with other third parties. Your profile is shared in aggregate form only.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Log Files</div> <p>Like most Web sites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track visitor's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Clear Gifs</div> <p>Clear gifs, or Web beacons, are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and we may use them to track the online movements of visitors to the j2global.com Web site. Clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to visitors' personally identifiable information.</p> <p>We may place Web beacons on some pages to allow us to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics about web site usage. We also may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails (or particular articles, links, etc.) have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Information Use</div> <p>This information is used in the following ways:</p> <ol> <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Customer Feedback and Support.

In that case, the ads appearing would be delivered to visitors through the third party advertising partners. Information about your visits to our Web site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), may be used to serve ads to you on the Web site. Third party advertising partners do not have access to personally identifiable information.</p> <p>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the j2global.com Web site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Children's Privacy</div> <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. j2 Global encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:</p> <ol> <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.

Each such communication has instructions on how to unsubscribe. In addition, you can unsubscribe directly on the j2global.com Web site. You also have the ability to send us questions or comments or to request other information regarding our products or services. We will respond to such requests as appropriate.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Sharing</div> <p>We do not share information obtained from visitors to the j2global.com Web site except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Legal Disclaimer</div> <p>Though we make every effort to preserve visitor privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, legal process served on our Web site, or in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activity.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</div> <p>We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Third Party Intermediaries</div> <p>We may use third parties to host certain portions of the j2global.com Web site and to fulfill certain requests for information from visitors to the site. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Business Transactions</div> <p>In the event j2 Global goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, visitors' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. You will be notified prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information. If as a result of the business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection you will be given a choice not to have your information used in this different manner, as described in the notification of changes section, below.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Links</div> <p>The j2global.com Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that j2 Global is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information, including j2 Global's other Web sites. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by j2 Global through the j2global.com Web site. j2 Global has advertising and affiliate relationships with dozens of third party sites which drive interested parties to our sites. Information that is collected on these sites does not fall within the auspices of this Policy. j2 Global has Co-Brand relationships with some Web sites. A site is a Co-Brand of j2 Global if it offers j2 Global technology or services to its users under a different brand. The Co-Branded sites will have their own privacy policies specific to each site, and the user should read them carefully before registration.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Security</div> <p>j2 Global takes every reasonable precaution to protect visitors' information. When visitors submit sensitive information via the j2global.com Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p> <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also employ security measures to protect visitor-information off-line. All of our visitors' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerks or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</div> <p>If a visitor's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a visitor no longer desires to receive previously-requested information from j2 Global, the visitor can generally correct, update or delete/deactivate visitors' personally identifiable information by opting out of requested communications or contacting appropriate j2 Global personnel via the j2global.com Web site.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Notification of Changes</div> <p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes in this Privacy Policy, and other places we deem appropriate, so visitors to the j2global.com Web site are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. In some cases we will also email visitors, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our Privacy Policy.</p> <p>If, however, we are going to use visitors' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify visitors via email. Visitors will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Safe Harbor</div> <p>j2 Global is a participant in the Safe Harbor program developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles agreed upon by the U.S. and the E.U. For more information about the Safe Harbor and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Web site. In the event that any dispute arising out of or related to this policy is not settled by the parties, the parties will attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute by non-binding mediation in accordance with the American Arbitration Association Commercial Mediation Rules. No litigation for the resolution of such dispute may be commenced until the parties try in good faith to settle the dispute by such mediation in accordance with such rules and either party has concluded in good faith that amicable resolution through continued mediation of the matter does not appear likely. The parties to the mediation shall share the costs of mediation equally. Any settlement reached by mediation shall be recorded in writing, signed by the parties, and shall be binding on them.</p> <div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;" class="subSectionTitle">Data Retention</div> <p>The time period for which we keep information varies according to what the information is used for. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>
