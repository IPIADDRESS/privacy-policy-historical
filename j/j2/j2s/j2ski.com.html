<h2>How to contact us</h2>
<p>We can be reached via e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@j2ski.com">privacy@j2ski.com</a> .</p>
<p>This Policy is effective at <strong>1st May 2005</strong></p>
</div></div></div>

<div class="c3">
<h2>Our Privacy Policy - No Nonsense Summary</h2>
<h3>Why we provide this policy</h3>
<p>In the course of visiting our web site, our web server will exchange data with your web browser. In addition, if you wish to post messages to our forum we will ask you to provide a valid e-mail address. If you order anything from us we will, of course, require further information. This Policy tells you what data we keep and what we use it for. It also tells you what we will not use it for.</p>
<h3>What we <em>will not</em> do with data</h3>
<p>We will not pass any collected personal data to a third party (unless legally <em>required</em> to do so), nor will we use it to distribute un-solicited commercial e-mail (spam).</p>
<p>We will not use your e-mail address, or any other personal data that you may choose to provide, for any purpose other than that for which it is supplied.</p>
<h3>What we <em>will</em> do with data</h3>
<p>We will use our web server logs to analyse the use of our web site. These logs are standard Apache web server logs and may contain information telling us when and how you arrived at our site, which other web site(s) sent you and how long you stayed. They do not tell us who you are or where you live. Analysing this data in a generic fashion allows us to determine patterns of usage and improve the content of our site to suit our visitors.</p>
<h3>What we <em>may</em> do with data</h3>
<p>If you provide us with your e-mail address (required to post in our forum) we <em>may</em> occasionally send you short e-mails informing you of changes to our site that may interest you.</p>
<p>We may be required from time to time, by applicable law or legal order, to provide data to law enforcement and governmental agencies.</p>

<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<p>For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server records the IP address of the visitor, the referrer (the address of the web site whose link was followed to find ours), and the pages and files accessed on our server.</p>
<p>We may resolve the IP address to also collect the domain name, but not the e-mail address, of visitors to our Web pages.</p>
<p>For visitors who voluntarily register to post messages to our forum, and who communicate with us via e-mail, we will record their e-mail address(es).</p>
<p>The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and occasionally to notify visitors about updates to our Web site; it is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>We use "cookies" to record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, certain pages that users access or visit, or to ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads.</p>

<h2>Choosing not to receive information from us</h2>
<p>If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, and / or wish to de-register from our forum, simply let us know by sending us e-mail at the above address.</p>
<p>If you supply us with your postal address on-line you will receive only the service for which you provided it. We will never send out un-solicited postal mail, nor share that information with any other organisation.</p>
<p>Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line will only receive telephone contact from us in direct regard to the specific purpose for which they did so.</p>

<h2>Use of our partner sites</h2>
<p>To support the development of our site, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Web pages. Should you "click through" to any of our partners, we encourage you to consult the privacy policies of those sites.</p>

<h2>If we change this Policy</h2>
<p>If our information practices change at some time in the future we will contact you before we use your data for any new purpose. We will notify you of the policy change and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial or health information, we will redirect visitors to a secure server. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.</p>
<p>If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us at the above e-mail address.</p>
