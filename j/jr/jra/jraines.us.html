<p>In addition to the above, we have implemented on the Service certain "Google Analytics" features that support Display Advertising, including re-targeting. Users of the Service may opt out of Google Analytics, customize the Google Display Network ads by using the Google Ad Preferences Manager and learn more about how Google serves ads by viewing its Customer Ads Help Center. If you do not wish to participate in Google Analytics, you may also download the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.</p><br>
<p>Do Not Track Browser Disclosure</p>
<p>Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.</p><br>
<p>We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Websites for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the NAI "Consumer Opt-out" link and the DAA opt-out link above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p><br>
<p>Interacting with Other Users</p>
<p>The jraines.com  service is designed to allow people to collaborate. As such during your interactions with other users when you are Logged-In may expose you to opportunities to exchange information that is both personally identifiable and possibly intended to initiate contact beyond the scope of the Service. You should use reasonable and prudent caution with what you disclose publicly and to individuals.</p><br>
<p>First, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit publicly might be read, collected, or used by other users of the service, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages, mine your data, communicate with or market to you in other ways. We are not responsible for personally identifiable information you choose to disclose publicly and the Company has no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your activities or any of your submissions that are a result of your public activities. For more information, see the jraines.com  Service Agreement.</p><br>
<p>Second, the Service features content provided by independent users that are not vetted by the Company nor are they employed by the Company. If you contact another user, or another user contacts you, directly or indirectly via explicit or inferred information exposed by your use of the Service or other services, then that communication is independent of the Service, and thus not subject to this Privacy Policy. The Company is not responsible for what users may say, or how they may use information provided to them.</p><br>
<p>Other Privacy Considerations</p>
<p>We may transfer your information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a transfer or all or part of our business or assets (e.g., a sale, merger, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization) or are taking steps in anticipation of such a transaction (e.g., participating in due diligence).</p><br>
<p>Information from Users Outside of the United States</p>
<p>If you are visiting the Service from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and stored in our servers in the U.S. By using our Service, you consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this privacy policy, and acknowledge that data protection laws in the U.S. may be different or less restrictive than in some other countries.</p><br>
<p>Your California Privacy Rights</p>
<p>Under the California "Shine The Light" law, California residents may opt-out of the disclosure of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes (as those concepts are defined in that law). However, we do not currently engage in the type of sharing covered by that law.</p><br>
<p>Compliance With Legal Process</p>
<p>We may disclose personal information (1) if we believe such sharing is appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process; (2) to protect and defend our rights, services or property; (3) to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Service; or (4) to protect the safety or property of our users or any member of the public (among other things, this means that if we believe you have provided false information or attempted to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).</p><br>

                    What is Lei Gold Coin? Lei Gold is the first set of virtual coins that Lei Family
                    Group set for its “Global Eagle Plan.” Members can obtain it through subscription.
                    In order to avoid the market panic caused by sudden rise and drop, the Group thus
                    decided to adopt an operation model which keeps rising without dropping to stabilize
                    members’ benefits. Besides, when the subscription amount reaches certain number,
                    the second operation plan will be implemented. However, to enter the credit-based
                    virtualized exchange through the members’ original issue stock calls for guaranteed
                    expenditure. However, what the Group did in the previous stage can guarantee its
                    credibility. There is no problem with the Group’s number of members, capital and
                    strength. At the same time, the virtualization exchange is jointly established through
                    the family business and other relevant departments, so members can remain assured
                    to gain earnings.</p>
