<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>JW Player (legally known as LongTail Ad Solutions, Inc.) is a leading video player software and video management platform (collectively, the “<b>JW Player Technology</b>”). Our customers are businesses that use the JW Player Technology to host, embed and stream, and deliver advertising to, digital video over the <span id="CustomerProperty"></span>web (collectively, the “<b>JW Player Services</b>”).</p>
<p>JW Player has prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding the information we collect from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visitors to our website located at <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com">www.jwplayer.com</a> (the “<b>Corporate Website</b>”), including all subdomains,</li>
<li>Users who watch our customers’ videos on websites, apps, mobile apps, and other software powered by the JW Player Technology (each, a “<b>Customer Property</b>”) using a desktop or laptop PC, mobile phone, tablet, connected TV, set-top box, kiosk, virtual reality hardware, or other device, and</li>
<li>Visitors to our other owned-and-operated websites (each, a “<b>JW Player Website</b>”), including <a href="https://www.jwshowcase.com">www.jwshowcase.com</a> and <a href="https://tv.jwplayer.com">tv.jwplayer.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Privacy Policy does <i>not</i> describe the information collection practices of our customers that use the JW Player Technology on their Customer Properties. We are a third-party service provider to our customers. We recommend that you refer to our customers’ privacy policies to learn about their information collection practices.</p>
<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy.</b> JW Player will update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices. We will post all Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. The Privacy Policy posted on this page will say when that version went <span id="CorporateWebsite"></span>into effect. If you visit the Corporate Website or view a video on a Customer Property after a change, then you will have accepted JW Player’s new Privacy Policy. You are advised to review our Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
<h2><b>A. Corporate Website at <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com" style="color:black;">www.jwplayer.com</a></b></h2>
<p><b>1. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE CORPORATE WEBSITE</b></p>
<p>Our Corporate Website provides information about our company, business, and the services we provide. It is also the portal used by our customers to sign into the customer dashboard for the JW Player Services.</p>
<p>The Corporate Website collects Personal Data, Usage Data, and Tracking Data when you visit the site at <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com">www.jwplayer.com</a>. As used in our discussion about the Corporate Website in this Section A:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">“<b>Personal Data</b>” is the information about an individual that can be used to identify that individual. If you access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we use a <a href="/privacy/#EuropeWebsiteNote">different definition of Personal Data</a> to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<p></p>
<p>“<b>Tracking Data</b>” is the information collected by cookies and similar tracking technologies (e.g., pixel tags, web beacons, or scripts) that we use to keep track of visitor activity on the Corporate Website. (Note that the Tracking Data collected by the JW Player Technology is different, and is discussed in Section B.)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cookies</b> are small files that contain a small amount of data, typically including a unique identifier. They are generally placed on your browser by a website or other browser-based service. Our Corporate Website uses cookies.</li>
<li><b>Other tracking technologies</b>, in the context of the Corporate Website, include pixel tags, web beacons, and scripts, and are used to track usage and performance. (See Section B below for the tracking technologies used by the JW Player Technology.)</li>
</ul>
<p>“<b>Usage Data,</b>” in the context of the Corporate Website, is the information that your browser sends to JW Player’s servers when you visit the Corporate <span id="EuropeWebsiteNote"></span>Website.</p></div>
<p>
As with other Internet services, our web servers gather information automatically each time your browser or device interacts with the Corporate Website, and store that information in “log files.” The information stored in our web servers’ log files includes information that we call Personal Data, Usage Data and Tracking Data, and that we describe more fully in the following sections.</p>
<p><b>Note for visitors who access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Personal Data.</b> In the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, Personal Data is defined differently than in the U.S., and means a variety of data that identifies or can identify a particular unique user or device (e.g., names, addresses, cookie identifiers, mobile device identifiers, precise location data and biometric data). For visitors who access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data – such as a visitor’s full Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the information that we associate with a unique identifier (like a cookie or other tracking technology) – are Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Legal grounds for processing your Personal Data when accessing the Corporate Website.</b> For visitors who access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we process your Personal Data for the purposes set out in Section A.2. on one or more of the following legal grounds:<br>

<li>It is necessary for our contractual relationship;</li>

These service providers may have access to your Personal Data in order to perform tasks on our behalf (<i>e.g.,</i> to send you information that you request or that we believe is of interest to you).</p>
<p><span id="Transfer"></span>JW Player uses third-party advertising companies to advertise JW Player and the JW Player Services. We allow these service providers to use their tracking technologies on the Corporate Website so that we can target ads about JW Player to you when you are elsewhere on the Internet. This process is sometimes referred to as interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising. If you want more information about these third-party advertising companies, or if you wish to opt out of this type of advertising, please visit the ad industry choice mechanism at <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
<p><b>6. TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.</b> As JW Player works with global companies and technologies, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally provided.  This may be intra-group or to third parties that we work with who are likely located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to the United States and process it there.</p>
<p><span id="Technology"></span><b>Note for visitors who access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK:</b> If we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we will take steps to make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data. JW Player is <a href="/privacy/#PrivacyShield">Privacy Shield certified</a>.</p>
<h2><b>B. JW Player Technology</b></h2>
<p><b>1. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY JW PLAYER TECHNOLOGY ABOUT USERS</b></p>
<p>Our customers are primarily web publishers (each, a “<b>Customer</b>”) that deploy JW Player Technology on their <a href="/privacy/#CustomerProperty">Customer Properties</a> to provide their visitors (each, a “<b>User</b>”) with a high-quality video viewing experience.</p>
<p>In Section B, we describe the information that is collected from Users who view videos and ads on a Customer Property. The JW Player Technology collects <b>Usage Data</b> and <b>Tracking Data</b> from Users. Note that the Tracking Technologies used in the JW Player Technology are different from the Tracking Technologies used on the Corporate Website.</p>
<p><b>2. ABOUT USAGE DATA AND TRACKING DATA</b></p>
<ol type="a" style="font-weight: bold; padding-left: 20px;">
<li>Usage Data and Tracking Data Collected by the JW Player Technology.<span style="font-weight: normal" ;=""> The JW Player Technology collects Usage Data and Tracking Data from a User when he or she views video on a Customer Property.  As used in our discussion about the JW Player Technology in this Section B:
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">“<b>Usage Data</b>” is the information that a User’s browser automatically sends to JW Player’s servers when a User accesses video or sees an ad on a Customer Property. This information includes a User’s device type, screen resolution, operating system version, and Internet browser type and version.<p></p>
<p>“<b>Tracking Data</b>” is the information collected by the JW Player Technology from Users who access videos on a Customer Property, and consists primarily of the following:</p>
<ul type="disc" ;="">
<li><b>Proprietary tracking technologies</b> used by the JW Player Technology for video delivery and performance reporting. These tracking technologies include the following:
<ul type="disc" ;="">
<li>Local ID, which is stored on a User’s computer to identify a User’s player on a given Customer Property.</li>
<li>Global ID, which is stored on a User’s browser and JW Player’s servers and identifies a User across different players and Customer Properties. <b>The JW Player Technology does not assign a Global ID to Users whose Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are based in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK.</b></li>
<li>Viewer ID, which is stored on JW Player’s servers to identify a User.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other tracking technologies include pixel tags, web beacons, and scripts, and are used for ad delivery and reporting.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
As with other Internet services, our web servers gather information automatically each time a User’s browser or device interacts with the JW Player Technology, and store that information in “<b>log files.</b>” The information stored in our web servers’ log files includes Usage Data and Tracking Data.</p>
<p>The Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by the JW Player Technology include:</p>
<ul type="disc" ;="">
<li>Information collected through tracking technologies.</li>
<li>Browser type and version.</li>
<li>User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address.</li>
<li>Unique identifiers set by our tracking technologies to identify video players, Users, and video sessions.</li>
<li>If a User is accessing the JW Player Technology through a mobile phone, tablet, connected TV, set-top box, kiosk, virtual reality hardware, or other device:  the type of device, unique device ID, device IP address, device operating system, and diagnostic data.</li>
<li>Information about how a User interacts with the JW Player Technology, such as the date and time of a User’s visit, the videos watched, and the time spent watching those videos.</li>
<li>Other aggregated information.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note for visitors who access the JW Player Technology from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK:</b></p>
<ul type="disc" ;="">
<li><b>Personal Data.</b> As <a href="/privacy/#EuropeWebsiteNote">previously noted</a>, some elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data – for example, a visitor’s full Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the information that we associate with a unique identifier (like a cookie or other tracking technology) – are Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and we treat those elements as Personal Data when collected by the JW Player Technology from Users whose IP addresses are based in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK. Note that the JW Player Technology does not assign a Global ID to a User accessing the JW Player Technology from an EEA, Swiss or UK IP address. We will retain those elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are Personal Data under the GDPR for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required for the security or integrity of the JW Player Services or JW Player Technology, or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our legal agreements or policies.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Legal grounds for processing Personal Data on Customer Properties.</b> For Users who access the JW Player Technology from IP addresses in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we process the elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are considered Personal Data under the GDPR.  The GDPR makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “<b>data controllers</b>”) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “<b>data processors</b>”).  When we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our customers in order to provide our services to them, as is the case with the JW Player Technology, we are a data processor and our customers, as the data controllers, have primary responsibility for your Personal Data and are responsible for obtaining a legal basis to collect such data. If you have questions about Personal Data that is used primarily by a Customer Property on which the JW Player Technology is embedded or utilized, you should contact those companies with your questions about how they handle your Personal Data.
<p></p>
<p>With that in mind, if you have concerns about JW Player, you may contact our privacy officer, at <a href="privacy@jwplayer.com">privacy@jwplayer.com</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</span></li><li>How We May Use Usage Data and Tracking Data.<span style="font-weight: normal" ;=""> We use Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by the JW Player Technology for the following purposes:
<ul type="disc" ;="">
<li>Deliver video to Customer Properties, and ads on behalf of advertisers.</li>
<li>Recommend videos that a User may enjoy.</li>
<li>Prepare reports and analytics for our customers.</li>
<li>For our other business purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, diagnosing technical problems, operating, maintaining, enhancing and improving the JW Player Technology and JW Player Service, and developing new products and services.</li>
<li>As we believe appropriate for <a href="/privacy/#Compliance">Compliance Purposes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</span></li><li>When We May Disclose Usage and Tracking Data.<span style="font-weight: normal" ;=""> We may disclose Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by the JW Player Technology for the following purposes:
<ul type="disc" ;="">
<li><b>Service Providers.</b> To third-party service providers who provide services such as hosting, data analysis, IT infrastructure, IT services, customer service, auditing, security, fraud, and other similar functions to us or our Customers. These third parties have access to User Usage and Tracking Data to perform these tasks on our behalf.</li>
<li><b>Transfer of Business.</b> To a third party to which we have transferred our business, assets or stock in the event that JW Player is involved in a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of some or all of our business, assets or stock, including during due diligence related to any such transaction (and also including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding).</li>
<li>As we believe appropriate for <a href="/privacy/#Compliance">Compliance Purposes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p></p></span></li></ol>
<p><b>3. USER CHOICES FOR THE JW PLAYER TECHNOLOGY</b></p>
<ol type="a" style="font-weight: bold; padding-left: 20px;">
<li>For Users who access the JW Player Technology from the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK: The Do Not Track Browser Setting.<span style="font-weight: normal" ;=""> Certain versions of the JW Player Technology support Do Not Track for Users in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. Do Not Track is a preference Users can set in their web browser to inform websites that they do not want to be tracked. Users can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of their web browser. We make reasonable efforts to maintain compatibility between our technology and Do Not Track functionality across different web browsers. However, you should be aware that, despite our reasonable efforts, there may be circumstances in which a particular Do Not Track setting is not recognized and honored.
<p></p>
<p>Note that even if a User enables and JW Player recognizes Do Not Track, the JW Player Technology will continue to collect Usage Data about each visit to a Customer Property, because Usage Data are automatically sent by the User’s web browser. However, the Usage Data will not be associated with a unique identifier, and the JW Player Technology will not be able to associate such User Data collected with User.</p></span></li>
<li>Check Our Customers’ Privacy Policy.<span style="font-weight: normal" ;=""> Users interact with the JW Player Technology, because our Customers have implemented the JW Player Technology in their Customer Properties. We recommend that Users check the privacy policy of the Customer Properties that they visit for information about the user choices available from our Customers. Many Customer Properties use third-party advertising companies for interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising. If you want more information about these third-party advertising companies, please visit the ad industry choice mechanism at <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</span></li>
<p></p></ol>
<p><b>4. FOR USERS WHO ACCESS THE JW PLAYER TECHNOLOGY FROM THE EEA, SWITZERLAND, AND THE UK: TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.</b> See <a href="/privacy/#Transfer">Section A.6</a> for information regarding those elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are Personal Information under the GDPR.</p>
<p><b>5. SERVICE PROVIDERS.</b> We work with third parties that provide services and functionality for the JW Player Technology. These service providers may have access to Usage Data and Tracking Data of the JW Player Technology in order to perform tasks on our behalf. Occasionally, we may give our service providers explicit permission to use the Usage Data or Tracking Data to enhance the fraud-detection, security, or other features of their services.</p>
<p><span id="Showcase">At our Customers’ instruction, we work with the service providers of our Customers. We may provide Usage Data and Tracking Data collected on a Customer Property to that Customer’s service providers.</span></p>

These owned-and-operated websites (each, a “<b>Showcase Website</b>”) provide Users with video content prepared by JW Player and our Customers.<br>
The Showcase Website is powered by the JW Player Technology. The JW Player Technology collects Usage Data and Tracking Data when a User visits a Showcase Website. Please refer to Section B for information about the Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by the JW Player Technology.</p>
<p><b>2. SERVICE PROVIDERS.</b> In addition to the service providers described in Section B.5., we use third-party advertising companies to facilitate advertising on the Showcase Websites.

If we know that the Personal Data we have collected is from or about a Child, we place that Personal Data in a separate category for restrictive handling. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a Child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
<p><b>4. RECOURSE, PRIVACY COMPLAINTS BY EUROPEAN UNION AND SWISS RESIDENTS: PRIVACY SHIELD.</b> JW Player complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.
