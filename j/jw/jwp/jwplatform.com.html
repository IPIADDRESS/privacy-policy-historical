			<h1>JW Player Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>JW Player (LongTail Ad Solutions, Inc., LongTail, JW Player, Company, we, our or us) is an online video software company. Our primary offerings are a video player and a video content management system (collectively, the technology Platform). Our products and services (the Services) enable websites to embed video, stream and host videos and deliver advertising across the web.</p>
<p>The Company primarily serves three groups: those who surf the web (Users), those who provide video and other types of content (Publishers) and those who advertise their products and services (Advertisers). Publishers place our products on their websites so Users may view videos. In some cases, Advertisers place advertising messages via our products and services via third-party ad servers. We help the Publishers understand how videos are being viewed on their websites. We also help Advertisers understand which of their ads were viewed so they can better understand which ads are more effective.</p>
<p>This privacy policy (Policy) explains how information is collected and used pursuant to offering our Platform and Services. This Policy also explains how information is collected and used in connection with our corporate website located at <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com">https://www.jwplayer.com</a> (the Website) as well as how information is collected directly from Publishers and Advertisers who use our Platform and Services. By using or accessing the Platform or the Website, You acknowledge and accept the practices described in this Policy. We reserve the right to change this Policy from time to time. Your continued use of the Website or Platform constitutes your acceptance of the Policy then in effect. For this reason, you should review the Policy from time to time to ensure that you understand and are willing to accept our current privacy practices.</p>
<h2>Privacy Practices for our Technology Platform</h2>
<p>We offer Publishers the Platform to upload videos, manage video content and gain insight into how Users watch video within our easy to use online dashboard. Our Platform tools collect certain non-personally identifiable information from User interactions with the videos Publishers upload via our Platform tools. This information includes: the User’s IP address, browser type, Internet Service Provider, computer (or mobile device’s) operating system and mobile device identifiers. We also collect the URL of the page where our Platform tools are enabled, the referring URL, the version of the video player the Publisher is utilizing, when and how long the video was played, which advertising message(s) were inserted into the video, whether the video was played in full screen mode, and certain meta data about the video or the Publisher’s web page.</p>
<p>We use this information in a number of ways, including: a) to help us ensure that the web content is deploying accurately, b) to help us, our Publishers and our Advertisers understand how the web content and advertising we deploy is being viewed by Users, and c) to help ensure that the advertising and videos are both appropriate and relevant to User interests.</p>
<p>We may use cookies in association with our Platform. Cookies are small files placed on the hard drive of your computer. We may use cookies to help us understand how our Platform is being used, to tailor advertising, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes. For more information about cookies and web beacons, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. Like many video technologies, we may use Flash and similar technologies to enable our video players. However, we don’t use those technologies (e.g., Flash cookies) for advertising.</p>
<p>Our Services also may enable third-parties to place cookies and use other tracking technologies to help those third-party companies conduct interest-based advertising and cross-device advertising on participating publisher websites. For more information about those practices, please scroll down to the section marked “<a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/privacy/#ad-choices">Your Choices</a>.”</p>
<h2>Privacy Practices for our Website</h2>
<p>Our website (the Website) is directed primarily to Publishers and Advertisers, not Users. We collect personally identifiable information (e.g., full name, postal address, email, telephone number) via the Website only when you choose to provide it to us. For example, you may choose to provide your name, email address and credit card number when you order a commercial license of the JW Player. You may also setup an account with us, and while registering you may provide your name, email address and additional information. You may further provide your name, telephone number and other information in an email or via an online form in order to ask us a question or subscribe to our email newsletter. We, or our agents and service providers, generally use this information for the reason it was provided (e.g., to facilitate your order or to answer your question).</p>
<p>Also, if you register to use the free edition of our products and Services, we may send you emails asking if you’d like to purchase paid editions. We offer the opportunity to opt-out of future marketing emails.</p>
<p>You can choose not to provide certain information, but this will limit your ability to purchase products offered on the Website, or to take advantage of some of our features for Website customers.</p>
<h2 style="position: relative"><span id="ad-choices" style="position:absolute;top:-100px"></span>Cookies and Interest Based Advertising, Your Choices</h2>
<p>We also use cookie technology on our Website. The cookies we use do not reveal any personally identifiable information. We use cookies on this Website for a number of distinct purposes and generally offer choices regarding cookies when you first visit our Website and then store those preference for a period of time. For example, we use site performance cookies to help us determine which country you are in while visiting our Website, to enhance your experience and to determine for which one of our partners, if any, referred you to our Website. We also use third party analytics cookies and other tools such as Google Analytics on our Website to obtain non-personally identifiable information. These third-party tools collect information such as how often users visit the Website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Website. We use the information we get from our analytics partners to improve the Website. We do not combine the information collected through the use of analytics tools with personally identifiable information. We do not currently take action in response to browser based Do Not Track signals.</p>
<p>We enable third-party advertisers to use their advertising and tracking cookies to collect information about your visits to the Website and also collect information about your visits to other websites in order to help deliver more relevant advertising messages to you and other consumers. This process is sometimes referred to as online behavioral advertising or interest based advertising. And where these third-party advertisers are able to infer that a particular computer and mobile device belong to the same user or household, they may extend their advertising campaigns across those devices. This process is sometimes referred to as cross-device advertising. If you want more information about these practices and information on how to opt-out from them, please visit the ad industry choice mechanism at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
<h2>Additional Privacy Disclosures</h2>
<h3>Information Security</h3>
<p>The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information, both during transmission and once it is received. This includes but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure; therefore, while the company strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>We store personally identifiable information such as email address or billing details so long as you continue to have a business relationship with JW Player. You may ask us to delete that information by following the instructions below. We store non-personally identifiable information collected via our Platform for up to one year in order to ensure that our Platform functions properly after which time such information is de-identified.</p>
<h3>Accessing and Deleting Your Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>Although we don’t collect personally identifiable information via our Platform, if you’d like us to provide access to, update, correct, delete, or deactivate any personally identifiable information that you have provided on the Website, please send your request to privacy@jwplayer.com, and the company will process your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.</p>
<h3>Information Relating to Children</h3>
<p>JW Player’s Website, Platform and Services are designed for those 13 years of age and older. JW Player does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If the company is made aware that it has received personally identifiable information from someone under 13, it will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from its records.</p>
<h3>Data Integrity, Purpose Limitation</h3>
<p>We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described above. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.</p>
<h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties, Onward Transfer</h3>
<p>JW Player does not rent, sell or share your personally identifiable information with non-affiliated third parties without your consent. The company may, however, share personally identifiable information with trusted third-party partners. These third party contractors are prohibited from using the information for purposes other than performing services for JW Player.</p>
<p>The company may share non-personally identifiable data collected via our Platform. For example, we provide Publishers with information about how Users view videos using our Platform. This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually, but may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions.</p>
<p>JW Player may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. JW Player may also disclose your information to third parties when obligated to do so by law and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected, or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.</p>
<p>Finally, JW Player may transfer information, including any personally identifiable information, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If JW Player is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via a notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your person personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield or Swiss-EU Privacy Shield, JW Player is potentially liable.</p>

<p>Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.</p>
