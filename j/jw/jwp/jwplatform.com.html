<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>JW Player (legally known as LongTail Ad Solutions, Inc.) is a leading video player software and video management platform (collectively, the â<strong>JW Player Technology</strong>â). Our customers are businesses that use the JW Player Technology to host, embed and stream, and deliver advertising to, digital video over the <span id="CustomerProperty"></span>web (collectively, the â<strong>JW Player Services</strong>â).</p>
<p>JW Player has prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding the information we collect from:</p>
<ul>

<li>Users who watch our customersâ videos on websites, apps, mobile apps, and other software powered by the JW Player Technology (each, a â<strong>Customer Property</strong>â) using a desktop or laptop PC, mobile phone, tablet, connected TV, set-top box, kiosk, virtual reality hardware, or other device, and</li>
<li>Visitors to our other owned-and-operated websites (each, a â<strong>JW Player Website</strong>â), including <a href="https://www.jwshowcase.com">www.jwshowcase.com</a> and <a href="https://tv.jwplayer.com">tv.jwplayer.com</a>.</li>

<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy.</strong> JW Player will update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices. We will post all Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. The Privacy Policy posted on this page will say when that version went into effect. If you visit the Corporate Website or view a video on a Customer Property after a change, then you will have accepted JW Playerâs new Privacy Policy. You are advised to review our Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

<h2 id="bjwplayertechnology"><strong>B. JW Player Technology</strong></h2>
<p><b>1. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY JW PLAYER TECHNOLOGY ABOUT USERS</b>

Our customers are primarily web publishers (each, a â<b>Customer</b>â) that deploy JW Player Technology on their <a href="/privacy/#CustomerProperty">Customer Properties</a> to provide their visitors (each, a â<b>User</b>â) with a high-quality video viewing experience.

In Section B, we describe the information that is collected from Users who view videos and ads on a Customer Property. The JW Player Technology collects <b>Usage Data</b> and <b>Tracking Data</b> from Users. Note that the Tracking Technologies used in the JW Player Technology are different from the Tracking Technologies used on the Corporate Website.

<b>2. ABOUT USAGE DATA AND TRACKING DATA</b></p>
<ol type="a" style="font-weight: bold; padding-left: 20px;">
<li>Usage Data and Tracking Data Collected by the JW Player Technology.<span style="font-weight: normal"> The JW Player Technology collects Usage Data and Tracking Data from a User when he or she views video on a Customer Property.  As used in our discussion about the JW Player Technology in this Section B:
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">â<b>Usage Data</b>â is the information that a Userâs browser automatically sends to JW Playerâs servers when a User accesses video or sees an ad on a Customer Property. This information includes a Userâs device type, screen resolution, operating system version, and Internet browser type and version.
<p>â<b>Tracking Data</b>â is the information collected by the JW Player Technology from Users who access videos on a Customer Property, and consists primarily of the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<b>Proprietary tracking technologies</b> used by the JW Player Technology for video delivery and performance reporting. These tracking technologies include the following:
<ul type="disc">
<li>Local ID, which is stored on a Userâs computer to identify a Userâs player on a given Customer Property.</li>
<li>Global ID, which is stored on a Userâs browser and JW Playerâs servers and identifies a User across different players and Customer Properties. <b>The JW Player Technology does not assign a Global ID to Users whose Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are based in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK.</b>
</li>
<li>Viewer ID, which is stored on JW Playerâs servers to identify a User.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other tracking technologies include pixel tags, web beacons, and scripts, and are used for ad delivery and reporting.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
As with other Internet services, our web servers gather information automatically each time a Userâs browser or device interacts with the JW Player Technology, and store that information in â<b>log files.</b>â The information stored in our web serversâ log files includes Usage Data and Tracking Data.

The Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by the JW Player Technology include:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Information collected through tracking technologies.</li>
<li>Browser type and version.</li>
<li>Userâs Internet Protocol (IP) address.</li>
<li>Unique identifiers set by our tracking technologies to identify video players, Users, and video sessions.</li>
<li>If a User is accessing the JW Player Technology through a mobile phone, tablet, connected TV, set-top box, kiosk, virtual reality hardware, or other device:  the type of device, unique device ID, device IP address, device operating system, and diagnostic data.</li>
<li>Information about how a User interacts with the JW Player Technology, such as the date and time of a Userâs visit, the videos watched, and the time spent watching those videos.</li>
<li>Other aggregated information.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note for visitors who access the JW Player Technology from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<b>Personal Data.</b> As <a href="/privacy/#EuropeWebsiteNote">previously noted</a>, some elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data â for example, a visitorâs full Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the information that we associate with a unique identifier (like a cookie or other tracking technology) â are Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and we treat those elements as Personal Data when collected by the JW Player Technology from Users whose IP addresses are based in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK. Note that the JW Player Technology does not assign a Global ID to a User accessing the JW Player Technology from an EEA, Swiss or UK IP address. We will retain those elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are Personal Data under the GDPR for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required for the security or integrity of the JW Player Services or JW Player Technology, or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our legal agreements or policies.</li>
<p></p>
<li>
<b>Legal grounds for processing Personal Data on Customer Properties.</b> For Users who access the JW Player Technology from IP addresses in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we process the elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are considered Personal Data under the GDPR.  The GDPR makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as â<b>data controllers</b>â) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as â<b>data processors</b>â).  When we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our customers in order to provide our services to them, as is the case with the JW Player Technology, we are a data processor and our customers, as the data controllers, have primary responsibility for your Personal Data and are responsible for obtaining a legal basis to collect such data. If you have questions about Personal Data that is used primarily by a Customer Property on which the JW Player Technology is embedded or utilized, you should contact those companies with your questions about how they handle your Personal Data.

<p>With that in mind, if you have concerns about JW Player, you may contact our privacy officer, at <a href="privacy@jwplayer.com">privacy@jwplayer.com</a>.</p>

<ol type="a" style="font-weight: bold; padding-left: 20px;">
<li>For Users who access the JW Player Technology from the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK: The Do Not Track Browser Setting.<span style="font-weight: normal"> Certain versions of the JW Player Technology support Do Not Track for Users in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. Do Not Track is a preference Users can set in their web browser to inform websites that they do not want to be tracked. Users can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of their web browser. We make reasonable efforts to maintain compatibility between our technology and Do Not Track functionality across different web browsers. However, you should be aware that, despite our reasonable efforts, there may be circumstances in which a particular Do Not Track setting is not recognized and honored.

<p>Note that even if a User enables and JW Player recognizes Do Not Track, the JW Player Technology will continue to collect Usage Data about each visit to a Customer Property, because Usage Data are automatically sent by the Userâs web browser. However, the Usage Data will not be associated with a unique identifier, and the JW Player Technology will not be able to associate such User Data collected with User.</p></span>
</li>
<li>Check Our Customersâ Privacy Policy.<span style="font-weight: normal"> Users interact with the JW Player Technology, because our Customers have implemented the JW Player Technology in their Customer Properties. We recommend that Users check the privacy policy of the Customer Properties that they visit for information about the user choices available from our Customers.
