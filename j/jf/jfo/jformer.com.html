<a id="cookies"></a>
</p><h4>Cookies and Clear GIFs</h4>
<p>
    <strong>What Are Cookies</strong><br>

    Cookies are files that web servers place on an Internet user’s computer that are designed to store basic information (such as visitor preferences). The use of cookies on the Site allows visitors to enjoy more seamless visits and more accurately measures visitor behavior on the Site. There are two types of cookies that we may use: session and persistent. Session cookies exist only during an Internet user’s online session. They disappear from the user’s computer when he/she closes the browser software. Persistent cookies remain on the user’s computer after the browser has been closed. The cookies used on the Site do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser, unless you choose to identify yourself voluntarily. You may choose to identify yourself for any one of the following reasons: by asking the browser to remember your username and password, by responding to a promotional offer, or by personalizing a web page or requesting more information on a product or service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How We Use Cookies</strong> <br>
    When you interact with the Site, we strive to make that experience easy, meaningful, and relevant. When you come to the Site, our web server uses cookies to improve your interaction with the Site by, for example, remembering your preferences and dynamically serving more relevant content to you. More specifically, we use cookies to measure your behavior on the Site and to save personal settings on specific pages. For our customers who login to our products through the Site, cookies can also be used to save the username so that we can process the saved login information and quickly log that user into the product. Cookies also help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in. We may link personal information that you have submitted on the Site with our cookies that are associated with your visit(s) to the Site in order to provide more relevant content to you during your visit(s). We use cookies (that only we can read and use) to identify the fact that you are one of our customers or a prior Site visitor (as applicable). Visitors who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will still be able to browse the Site; however, they may lose some of the functionality provided by the use of cookies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Controlling Our Use of Cookies</strong><br>
    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you are using a public computer or do not otherwise want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used. For further information about disabling cookies you can visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to login or use other interactive features of our websites and services that depend on cookies.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>What are Clear GIFs?</strong><br>
    Clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help Site operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows the Site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How We Use Clear GIFs</strong><br>
    We utilize clear GIFs to measure visitor behavior, to help us improve visitor experience, and to manage site content.  We, and our Subsidiaries, may use clear GIFs on this Site, in our e-mails, in our advertisements on other web sites, or in our advertisements in others' e-mails.
</p>

<a id="security"></a>
<h4>Security</h4>

<p>The Site has physical, administrative, and technical measures in place to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the data under our control, and to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of such data. For example, when the Site is accessed using Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0, or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that the data is safe, secure, and available only to our customers and us. In addition, we use secured server areas and advanced firewall technology to minimize the risk of security breaches for individually identifiable information that is volunteered on the Site. Finally, we provide unique usernames and passwords that must be entered each time a customer, or one of our employees that has a business need to access the information, logs on to one of our products via the Site. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of all data. </p>
<p>While we strive to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and therefore we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us. You send any information via the Site at your own risk.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<a id="thirdparty"></a>
<h4>Third-Party Sites</h4>
<p>The Site contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites. Customers and visitors should check the privacy policy statements of these other websites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private and confidential.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<a id="optout"></a>
<h4>Opt-Out and Update Policies</h4>
<p><strong>Opt-Out Policy:</strong><br>
			 	 We offer visitors to the Site a means for controlling the use of session information. If, at any time after registering for information or ordering our services, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about the use of information volunteered by you, please send us a request specifying your new choice.
</p>

<p><strong>Updating Your Information:</strong><br>
	 	We provide all visitors to the Site options for reviewing, changing, deleting and modifying personally identifiable information previously provided. You can expect to receive a response to any such update request within thirty (30) days of our receipt of the same.</p>

<p>We will provide you with a copy of any personal information that you have provided in connection with your visit to the Site should you request it, but will require evidence of your identity. We may require a nominal administration fee to cover our costs in providing such information. If you wish to access the personal information we have about you, or to correct factual errors in our records, please contact us as set forth in the "Contact Us" section below. To protect your privacy, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. </p>
