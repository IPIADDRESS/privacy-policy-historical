<strong>What information does JNY.com collect?</strong></p><p>
JNY.com collects data that you provide to our sales associates in our JNY stores and outlets, or customer service center; or through licensed resellers both online and offline; or on JNY.com either through transactions, email registration, sweepstakes, contests, or online membership and general information requests; or through phone, mail and fax interactions or paper registrations that you submit.</p><p>

This includes information such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, any personal preferences you choose to provide, transaction details such as style, size, price, discount, date, store, your credit card number and expiration date used for transactions, and an encrypted password to ensure maximum protection of your privacy.</p><p>

JNY.com occasionally obtains email addresses of active JNY customers who requested fashion, promotional and/or general corporate information request emails on other websites. JNY.com also reserves the right to obtain publicly accessible customer demographics.</p><p>

<a name="use"></a>
<strong>How does JNY.com use this information?</strong></p><p>
JNY.com does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any personal information you provide to us both offline and online, or through any of our licensed sales and marketing channels.
JNY.com uses this information to confirm and process sales transactions or to contact you with questions or communications about your order, respond to your customer service inquiries, or to respond to general corporate-related information requests.</p><p>

JNY.com also uses this information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience, both online and in our stores, and to communicate with you for marketing and promotional purposes via targeted postal pieces, phone messages, or personalized emails. You may indicate your contact preferences regarding promotional communications either directly to us online or to customer service representatives or to the sales associates in our stores.</p><p>

<a name="access"></a>
<strong>How can you access your information?</strong></p><p>

Whenever you want to communicate with us to change, update or delete any personal information or to remove you from our e-mail or postal mailing lists, you can send us an e-mail to the e-mail address indicated under our Customer Service feature on our web site.</p><p>

Currently, we do not provide online access to information that you provided to JNY.com online or offline or through any of our licensed resellers. But at any time you may request access to your information from our customer service representatives.</p><p>

To alleviate any concern on your part, JNY.com does not store or provide access to credit card information, which is why you will be required to re-enter your credit card and expiration date with every online credit card transaction.</p><p>

<a name="protect"></a>
<strong>How does JNY.com protect your information?</strong></p><p>

All information input by you and transmitted to our website when you place an order or provide personal information is protected by password and by an encryption using Secure Socket Layer Technology ("SSL"). SSL encrypts your order and personal information before it is transmitted to us to avoid the decoding of your information by anyone other than JNY.com.</p><p>

<a name="disclose"></a>
<strong>Does JNY.com disclose your information to others?</strong></p><p>

JNY.com and Jones Apparel Group does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any personal information you provide to us online or at our licensed stores and distribution partners, nor do we share such information with third parties except for the express purpose of assisting us in fulfilling your transactions, responding to customer service inquiries, updating your customer information record in our database, deploying our promotional offers to you, or fulfilling your request to unsubscribe from our email. We do not authorize those third parties to make any other use of your information.</p><p>

Jones Apparel Group, Inc. is the parent company for JNY.com. Jones Apparel Group maintains a single database of customer information for several brands owned by the <a href="http://www.jny.com/">Jones Apparel Group</a> family of companies, including <a href="http://www.ninewest.com/">Nine West</a>, <a href="http://www.easyspirit.com/">Easy Spirit</a>, <a href="http://www.bandolino.com/">Bandolino</a>, <a href="http://www.kasper.com/">Kasper</a>, <a href="http://www.glojeans.com/">GLO Jeans</a>, <a href="http://www.anneklein.com/">Anne Klein</a> and <a href="http://www.jonesnewyork.com/">Jones New York</a> brands.  For each customer in this database, Jones Apparel Group maintains a separate set of contact preferences for each brand to which that customer has provided her customer information. When you establish or update your customer profile information with one of the Jones Apparel Group brands, whether through a purchase, registration or email sign-up at a company-owned or operated website, specialty store or outlet store for one of the Jones Apparel Group brands, through a customer service representative, or in any other communication you may have with us, we will update your customer record on the Jones Apparel Group database.  This does not in any way authorize use of your information by the other Jones Apparel Group brands for any other purpose, including marketing and promotional purposes.</p><p>

JNY.com honors every request to unsubscribe from receipt of emails within ten (10) days of receiving the request, not only for promotional emails that JNY.com sends, but also for emails about JNY.com that we permit other companies to send to their own list of subscribers. As such, in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, JNY.com will provide to such companies the email address of anyone who has submitted to JNY.com an unsubscribe request, provided such company agrees not to disclose or use such email address for any other purpose than honoring your request to not receive JNY.com promotional emails.</p><p>

JNY.com reserves the right to use and/or disclose to others information about your demographics and use of our website in a manner that does not reveal your identity.</p><p>

<a name="child"></a>
<strong>How does JNY.com protect a child's privacy?</strong></p><p>

In keeping with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, JNY.com will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from any person under the age of 13, without first seeking prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a user of our website is under the age of 13 and has provided an online registration without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove that child's personal information from our files.</p><p>
