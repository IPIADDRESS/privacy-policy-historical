<p>JDA Software, Inc. and all JDA Subsidiaries, including but not limited to, JDA Software UK Limited (for European operations) &nbsp;("<strong>JDA</strong>," “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”) are committed to protecting your privacy (see <a href="https://jda.com/contact-us">https://jda.com/contact-us</a> for further details of these Subsidiaries (including contact information).</p>
<p>This Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy (this “<strong>Policy</strong>”) explains how your Information (as defined below) is collected, used and disclosed by us and how we collect Information through the use of cookies and related technologies. JDA Software, Inc. is primarily responsible for the operations of the Platforms but all JDA Subsidiaries act as data controllers (as such term is defined in European data protection laws) for the data processing operations described in this Policy.</p>
<p>This Policy also tells you how you can access and update your Information and describes your data protection rights, including a right to object to some processing that we carry out or where we rely on consent, how to withdraw that consent.</p>
<p>This Policy applies to Information we obtain from or about you in an online and offline context such as when you (i) visit our website at <a href="http://jda.com/">http://jda.com</a> and other locations where this Policy appears (collectively, our “<strong>Sites</strong>”) and use the JDA mobile, cloud and other client applications (our “<strong>Applications</strong>”), (together, our “<strong>Platforms</strong>”); (iii) interact with our social media pages and adverts, customer support, online chats or community forums, surveys, webinars or blogs; (iv) participate in our training solutions, or attend our events and demonstrations; or (v) interact with us as vendors, Alliance Partners, resellers, technology partners or other professional advisors. Certain sections may not be applicable to you depending on how you provide your Information to us or interact with us. </p>
<p>We may provide additional information about our privacy practices at other points, for example, when we ask you to provide Information in connection with a particular service, and where this will help us provide more relevant and timely information.</p>
<p>If we need, or are required, to contact you concerning any event that involves your Information we may do so by email, telephone, or mail as appropriate (and in accordance with your communication preferences).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Introduction and Summary.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>This policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use your Information. Although we encourage you to read the entire Policy, the following provides a summary of some of the important aspects of our privacy practices:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
    <li>We use your Information primarily to provide you with access to our Platforms and other products, services, and information we offer. </li>
    <li>We combine or link Information that we collect about you from our different interactions with you, both online (e.g. via our Platforms) and offline (e.g. via our events or via calls to customer support).</li>
    <li>We share your Information across the JDA Subsidiaries in our organization and combine the Information we collect through one Subsidiary with Information collected through other Subsidiaries.</li>
    <li>We share your Information with certain trusted third parties as outlined below.</li>
    <li>We take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure your Information, but we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your Information will remain secure in all circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information Received, Collected, and Obtained by JDA.&nbsp; </strong>The information we receive, collect, and obtain includes information that is both Personal and Non-Personal.&nbsp; “<strong>Personal</strong>” information is a broad concept and refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable living individual. This includes references to obvious identifiers such as name but also non- obvious identifiers such as an identification number or an online identifier such as an IP address or cookie identifier.&nbsp;“<strong>Non-Personal</strong>” information refers to information that is anonymous whereby you are not or no longer identifiable from that information.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We receive, collect, and obtain the following general types of Personal and Non-Personal information (together, “<strong>Information</strong>”):&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Information Obtained Directly from You.&nbsp; </strong>We collect Information about you directly when you voluntarily provide it to us through the Platforms or other interactions with us such as your name, contact information, gender, preferred language, job title and function, user name and password, billing information and information about your access to and use of the Platforms and your contacts with other users through the Platforms, as well as other Information you may volunteer to us (e.g. event feedback, profile photo, business card).&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Information Automatically Collected about You.&nbsp; </strong>We automatically obtain Information about you when you access our Platforms. This includes (i) Information about the devices you use to access the Platforms including your device's IP address, your browser type and version, time zone setting, and operating system and platform; (ii) Information about your visit to our Platforms including the URL clickstream to, through and from our Platforms (including date and time); products and services you have viewed or searched for, your account activity (when logged in); the content (and any ads) you view or interact with, page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages and page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. Some of this Information is collected using cookies and related technologies (see Section on <strong>Cookies and Related Technologies</strong> below for more detail). </p>
<p><strong>Information Obtained from Third Parties.</strong>&nbsp;From time to time (where permitted by applicable law), we collect Information such as contact information, your preferences, and other demographic data from trusted third party sources that are either publicly or commercially available (e.g. business partners, payment and delivery services, event providers, data brokers, social media networks, advertising networks, analytics providers, and search information providers) which will be used for the purposes outlined in this Policy. </p>
<p>We also receive Information you provide to our authorized Resellers and Alliance Partners of our products and services which will be used for the purposes outlined in this Policy.</p>
<p>When you pay for our products and services (e.g. to attend an event or participate in an online training module), we get information from our payment processing service provider who will carry out credit and antifraud checks on you and the payment method you provide in order to verify your identity, to validate your credit or debit card, to obtain an initial credit or debit card authorization and/or to authorize the purchase. </p>
<p>In order to ensure data accuracy and to offer you a better experience, we link or combine the Information that we collect from the different sources and channels outlined above (e.g. to provide targeted communications and advertising and for the other purposes outlined below). This includes combining Information collected by the different JDA Subsidiaries.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You do not have to provide Personal Information to access the Platforms but certain functionalities (such as to get access to Customer Support or Training) will not otherwise be available to you. You may however choose whether or not to receive marketing communications from us and we will only send you such communications where we have the appropriate consent to do so. For more information on your preferences regarding how we use your Information for marketing purposes, please see Section on <strong>Your Rights and Choices</strong> below. </p>
