<p>This Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy (this “<strong>Policy</strong>”) explains how your Information (as defined below) is collected, used and disclosed by us and how we collect Information through the use of cookies and related technologies. JDA Software, Inc. is primarily responsible for the operations of the Platforms but all JDA Subsidiaries act as data controllers (as such term is defined in European data protection laws) for the data processing operations described in this Policy.</p>
<p>This Policy also tells you how you can access and update your Information and describes your data protection rights, including a right to object to some processing that we carry out or where we rely on consent, how to withdraw that consent.</p>
<p>This Policy applies to Information we obtain from or about you in an online and offline context such as when you (i) visit our website at <a href="http://jda.com/">http://jda.com</a> and other locations where this Policy appears (collectively, our “<strong>Sites</strong>”) and use the JDA mobile, cloud and other client applications (our “<strong>Applications</strong>”), (together, our “<strong>Platforms</strong>”); (iii) interact with our social media pages and adverts, customer support, online chats or community forums, surveys, webinars or blogs; (iv) participate in our training solutions, or attend our events and demonstrations; or (v) interact with us as vendors, Alliance Partners, resellers, technology partners or other professional advisors.

<p>If we need, or are required, to contact you concerning any event that involves your Information we may do so by email, telephone, or mail as appropriate (and in accordance with your communication preferences).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Introduction and Summary.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>This policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use your Information. Although we encourage you to read the entire Policy, the following provides a summary of some of the important aspects of our privacy practices:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
    <li>We use your Information primarily to provide you with access to our Platforms and other products, services, and information we offer. </li>
    <li>We combine or link Information that we collect about you from our different interactions with you, both online (e.g. via our Platforms) and offline (e.g. via our events or via calls to customer support).</li>

This includes references to obvious identifiers such as name but also non- obvious identifiers such as an identification number or an online identifier such as an IP address or cookie identifier.&nbsp;“<strong>Non-Personal</strong>” information refers to information that is anonymous whereby you are not or no longer identifiable from that information.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We receive, collect, and obtain the following general types of Personal and Non-Personal information (together, “<strong>Information</strong>”):&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Information Obtained Directly from You.&nbsp; </strong>We collect Information about you directly when you voluntarily provide it to us through the Platforms or other interactions with us such as your name, contact information, gender, preferred language, job title and function, user name and password, billing information and information about your access to and use of the Platforms and your contacts with other users through the Platforms, as well as other Information you may volunteer to us (e.g. event feedback, profile photo, business card).&nbsp; </p>

<p>We also receive Information you provide to our authorized Resellers and Alliance Partners of our products and services which will be used for the purposes outlined in this Policy.</p>
