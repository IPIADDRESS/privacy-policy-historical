<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a id="informationcollection"></a>INFORMATION COLLECTION</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a id="registration"></a>Registration and Other Information You Provide</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Services may collect "Personal Information" (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as your full name or e-mail address), account information (password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account) and demographic or other information (such as your ZIP or postal code and information about your interests and preferences). If we combine demographic or similar information with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Services are general audience services and are not intended for individuals younger than the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals younger than the age of 13 through our online services. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information online from anyone younger than the age of 13, we will use commercial reasonable efforts to delete that information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a id="informationthirdparties"></a>Information Third Parties Provide About You</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We may receive information about you from third parties. We may combine this information in our database and we may use it to offer you products or services, or for similar purposes. We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the Services, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a id="socialmedia"></a>Social Media/Integration with Third Party Platforms</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Services may permit you to interact with a third party site or service, such as enabling you to "like" us on another site or "share" content from Services with other sites (a “Social Networking Service”). If you choose to "like" or "share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the Services to a Social Networking Service, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Services. Similarly, if you interact with us through a Social Networking Service, we may have access to information about you (for example, if you "like" or "follow" our page on a third party site). Please note that if you mention or comment about us or the Services in your post to a third party platform, the third party platform may allow us to publish your post on the Services.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You may also choose to use a social media tool offered by a third party, but available on Services (such as posting a review or logging into the Services with your username and password for another site). Use of such a feature may allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. When you choose to use a social media tool available on a Service, you may be opting to link your activities on the Services with a third party site or service. That third party may collect information about your visits to the Services and may publish that activity to your profile or similar feature on that third party site. The information that we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy.
