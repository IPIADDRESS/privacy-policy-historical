However, please note that no method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of user information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.

<p>If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@jdsupra.com">info@jdsupra.com</a>. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your user information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development and, if so, will endeavor to do so as promptly as practicable under the circumstances.
