				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	
				<h2>Last updated: April 23, 2008:</h2><br>

				<p><a href="../index.aspx">This website</a> (the “Website”) provides users with access to JD Supra’s legal industry publishing services.  Our policies with regard to data collection and use of personal information of users and visitors to the Website are set forth in this statement (“Policy”).  By using this Website, you signify your acceptance of this Policy.</p>					
				
				
				<h2>Information Collection and Use by JD Supra</h2>
				<p>JD Supra collects users’ e-mail address and profession to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the JD Supra service. We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news or information regarding the service if you opt in to receive these emails during registration.</p>
				<p>JD Supra also logs IP addresses and aggregates non-personally identifiable user data and browser type from users and visitors to the Website. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.  This data is gathered using cookies and other similar technologies to customize the user’s experience and also provide us with information about how visitors use the Website. If you prefer not to enable cookies, you may change your browser settings to disable cookies; however, please note that rejecting cookies while visiting the Website may result in certain parts of the Website not operating correctly or as efficiently as if cookies were allowed.</p>
				
				<h2>Email Choice/Opt-out</h2>
				<p>Users who opt in to receive emails during the registration process may choose to no longer receive e-mail updates and newsletters by selecting the “opt-out of future email” option in the email they receive from JD Supra or in their JD Supra account management screen.</p>
				
				<h2>Security</h2>
				<p>JD Supra takes reasonable precautions to insure that user information is kept private. We restrict access to user information to those individuals who reasonably need access to perform their job functions, such as our third party email service, customer service personnel and technical staff. However, please note that no method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of user information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
				<p>If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@jdsupra.com">info@jdsupra.com</a>. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your user information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development and, if so, will endeavor to do so as promptly as practicable under the circumstances.</p>
				
				
				<h2>Sharing and Disclosure of Information JD Supra Collects</h2>
				<p>Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, JD Supra will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries or requests; (3) comply with valid legal process; (4) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of JD Supra, Website visitors or the public; (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (6) enforce our Terms &amp; Conditions of Use.</p>
				<p>In the event there is a change in the corporate structure of JD Supra such as, but not limited to, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of substantial assets, JD Supra may, in its sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected on and through this Website to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.</p>
