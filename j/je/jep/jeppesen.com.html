            <b>SCOPE</b><br>
            This privacy policy (“Policy”) applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of 
            personal information by Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates 
            ("Jeppesen", "we" or "us") when you use our Web sites operated by Jeppesen that link to this 
            Policy including <a class="contentlink" href="http://www.jeppesen.com" onfocus="this.blur()">www.jeppesen.com</a> and <a class="contentlink " href="http://www.jeppdirect.com" onfocus="this.blur()">www.jeppdirect.com</a> 
            (the “Sites”), and the services associated therewith.&nbsp; Please take a moment to 
            read this Policy to learn more about our information practices. When you use the Sites you are 
            interacting with a United States based company and the Sites are intended to meet the laws of the 
            United States.<br><br>

            <b>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</b><br>
            We reserve the right to change the provisions of this privacy policy at any time by posting the 
            revised Policy on the Sites and indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated.&nbsp; We 
            encourage you to review this Policy whenever you visit our Sites to determine if any changes have 
            been made and to make sure that you understand how personal information you provide will be treated.<br><br>

            <b>PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
            As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that specifically 
            identifies an individual (such as user’s name, address, e-mail address, telephone number 
            or other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual) or 
            that is associated with an identifiable person (such as demographic information or information 
            about a person’s activities when such information is linked to personally identifying 
            information). &nbsp;Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, 
            which is data we collect about the use of the Sites or categories of Sites users, from which any 
            personal information has been removed. &nbsp;We collect aggregate data for a number of purposes, 
            including helping us understand trends and user needs so that we can better consider new 
            publications, products and services, and tailor existing publications, products and services to 
            user desires. This policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information.<br><br>

            <b>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
            We may collect personal information in a number of ways when you visit our Sites or use the various 
            services available on our Sites.  We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us 
            which may contain personal information. For example, if you register for the Sites, we may collect 
            your name, address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, and city and country and we may 
            collect other demographic information that you provide.  Personal information may also be collected 
            if you purchase products or services using the Site or provide such information in your profile or 
            in connection with leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user 
            or participating in any interactive areas or features on the Sites.<br><br>

            In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal or demographic 
            information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, contests, promotional 
            offers and other activities on the Sites.<br><br>

            We may also receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships. If we 
            combine this information with the other personal information we have collected, this Policy governs 
            our use and disclosure of such information.<br><br>

            <b>SPECIAL NOTICE REGARDING CHILDREN</b><br>
            Our Sites are not designed for, nor do we knowingly collect, personal information from children 
            under the age of 13.  If you are under 13 years of age, please do not provide your personal 
            information to us.<br><br>

            <b>EU SAFE HARBOR</b><br>
            Jeppesen abides by the safe harbor framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding 
            the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected from the European Union.&nbsp;

            identifiable information, we will treat this information as personal information; otherwise it 
            is treated as and used in the aggregate. Clear gifs (also know as web bugs or web beacons) may 
            also be used on the Sites or in emails relating to the Sites. Clear gifs are small, invisible 
            graphic images that allow the collection of certain information and monitor user activity on 
            the Sites. We use cookies, clear gifs, frames, server log analysis and other technology to

            from your hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. 
            If you block cookies, some portions of the Sites may not function properly.<br><br>

            We do not control cookies in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies 
            of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology. We may 
            also use a third party advertising company to display ads on the Sites. These companies may use 
            information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on the

            <b>USAGE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
            In general, we use personal information we collect to facilitate your use of the Sites, to provide 
            you with information, products and services you request, to inform you about other information, 
            events, promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to administer and 
            assist us with the operation of the Sites and of our business, and for the purpose for which the 
            information was provided. For example, we may use the information we collect to:

                <li>contact you about your use of the Sites, such as for administrative purposes or to provide

                <li>request feedback and to enable us to develop, customize and improve our information and

            </ul>

            <b>SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
            If we collect any personal information, we share and disclose such personal information only as 
            described in this Policy (as amended from time to time). We may share personal information with 
            third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who are engaged by or working with 
            us in connection with the operation of the Sites or performing any services on our behalf. For 
            example, we may use a third party to screen certain content before it is posted to the Sites. In 
            addition, we may offer various features through a third party service provider. When you use these 
            services, you are providing information directly to the provider of these services, and the 
            provision of such information is subject to such party's own privacy policy. We are not responsible 
            for any information you provide to these parties directly, and we encourage you to become familiar 
            with their practices before disclosing information directly to such third parties with which you 
            come into contact.<br><br>

            We also may disclose personal information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to 
            comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this 
            privacy policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts 
            owed to us; to protect our or our customers' rights, property or safety; to protect our customers from 
            fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Site; or if we believe that an emergency involving the 
            danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or 
            justifies disclosure of personal information. In addition, information about our customers, including 
            personal information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of any merger, acquisition, debt 
            financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership 
            in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of the 
            business assets of the Company.<br><br>

            The Sites may contain links to other sites, or other interactive forums hosted by a third party. 
            Please be aware that although we may participate in or utilize such other sites, we are not responsible 
            for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Sites 
            and to read the privacy policies of any Web site that collects personally identifiable information. 
            Similarly, if you entered the Sites through another Web site, we are also not responsible for the 
            privacy practices of that site, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating site 
            before providing any personal information to that site. This privacy policy applies solely to 
            information collected by us.<br><br>

            <b>ONLINE COMMUNITIES</b><br>
            The Sites may include certain online communities and other interactive features, such as user 
            profiles, forums, message boards and chat rooms.  You may be asked to choose a user or member name 
            and password in order to participate in certain features of the Services, which will be available 
            to the general public while you participate in some features of the Services, such as the online 
            communities. Please do not use your real name. Information you post in such public areas of the 
            Sites is publicly available and may be viewed by and shared with other users. You can restrict 
            user access to certain information through the privacy preferences setting on your account. However, 
            although we strive to use commercially reasonable efforts to implement these privacy preferences, 
            no system or security measure is perfect or impenetrable.  You should always be cautious when giving 
            out personal information to others in public online forums.  We are not responsible for protecting 
            such information that you may disclose to third parties through the Sites (e.g. sending your contact 
            information to another user through the chat service).<br><br>

            <b>PROTECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
            We strive to protect personal information while it is under our control. Your account information is 
            accessible online only through the use of a password. To help protect the confidentiality of personal 
            information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You 
            are responsible for all uses of the Sites by any person using your password. Please advise us 
            immediately if you believe your password has been compromised or misused.<br><br>

            <b>CHOICE REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</b><br>
            You may "opt out" to not receive promotional and marketing emails by viewing your profile on the My 
            Jeppesen link. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out" 
            of receiving service or account-related emails from Jeppesen.<br><br>

           <b>CORRECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, QUESTIONS</b><br>
           If you would like to verify, correct or delete any personal information we have collected or if you 
           have any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or Jeppesen's treatment of personal information, 
           please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@jeppesen.com" onfocus="this.blur()">privacy@jeppesen.com</a>, 
           or by writing to us at Jeppesen, BGA Sales &amp; Service, 55 Inverness Drive East, Englewood, CO 80112. You 
           may also correct certain information by using the "Account" and "Profile" section of the Sites. Please 
           note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain 
           information. When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Jeppesen's policy to 
           contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. For Safe Harbor related concerns, if we are 
           unable to reach a resolution, we will utilize a third party independent recourse mechanism to investigate 
           and resolve the dispute.
