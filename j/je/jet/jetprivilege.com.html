<p>8. <strong>Transferring Personal Information Globally</strong></p>
<p>8.1 We operate our business on a global basis. The countries to which we commonly disclose your personal information include India, where we and Jet Airways (our principal programme partner) have our head offices, and the countries where you are flying to and from. Some of these countries, for example, the UAE and the USA, have laws which do not offer, in the opinion of the European Commission or other supervisory authorities, an adequate level of data protection.</p>
<p>8.2 We will always strive to adopt the highest standards of privacy protection, wherever your personal information is located and adopt appropriate measures (consistent with locally applicable laws) to secure an adequate level of privacy protection. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable laws and carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests. Transfers will be limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. To this end:</p>
<p>8.2.1 we ensure that transfers within our group of companies will be covered by an agreement entered into by its members (called an “intra-group agreement”). This agreement contractually obliges each member of the Etihad Aviation Group to ensure that personal information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group;</p>
<p>8.2.2 where we transfer your personal information outside JetPrivilege or to third parties who help provide our products and services, we obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your personal information. Some of these assurances are well recognized certification schemes like the "EU - US Privacy Shield" for the protection of personal information transferred from within the European Union ("EU") to the USA; or</p>
<p>8.2.3 where we receive requests for information from government entities, international organisations or regulators, we carefully validate these requests to ensure that it is legally appropriate to share the requested personal information.</p>
<p>8.3 You have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your personal information when this is transferred as mentioned above. See also the section titled "Your Rights", below.</p>
