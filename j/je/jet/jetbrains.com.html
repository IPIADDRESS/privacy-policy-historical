<h2>JetBrains Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>JetBrains strongly believes that the protection of individualsâ€™ privacy is a critical issue when doing business
    via the Internet. We have created this policy to inform our site visitors and customers of the measures we employ to
    keep private and confidential the information they may choose to share with us.</p>

<p>JetBrains does collect some kinds of information from visitors to this Web site. By using this site, you agree to
    allow us to collect the kinds of information information described later on this page, and to use it in the ways
    described.</p>

<p>Should we ever need to change this policy, we will post the changes on this page and send an e-mail notification to
    customers and others who may have shared their e-mail addresses with us. We will also post a notification on our
    <a href="http://jetbrains.com/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> with a link to this file.</p>

<div class="feature">
    <h4>Handing of Personally Identifiable Information</h4>

    <p>On JetBrains Web sites, we store personal information about you ONLY after you have given us permission to do so.
        You may choose to provide information to us if, for example, you register for a trial license, purchase a
        product, or subscribe to a newsletter.</p>

    <p>JetBrains may use the information collected via this Web site anywhere in our international organization in order
        to process your inquiries and orders and/or to help improve our products. For example, information collected by
        our European headquarters may be shared with one of our offices in the United States and vice versa.</p>

    <p>Employees of JetBrains s.r.o. or approved contractors or resellers (collectively referred to as "JetBrains") have
        access to personally identifiable customer information. All employees, contractors, and resellers are legally
        bound to uphold this policy and observe your right to privacy and confidentiality. We will never share your
        information with third parties outside "JetBrains" unless you give express permission for us to do so, or unless
        we are required to do so under applicable law.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature">
    <h4>Privacy Across the Company</h4>

    <p>As an international company, JetBrains s.r.o. maintains databases in several countries. Any information that you
        submit to us via this Web site may be sent electronically to a database maintained in a different country. We
        protect your privacy around the world by ensuring that this Website and all JetBrains networks adhere to
        data-protection principles described in this page.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature">
    <h4>Third-party Order Procesing</h4>

    <p>Orders for JetBrains products are securely processed by Element 5. Their privacy policy is published on
        the Web at
        <a href="http://www.element5.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.element5.com/privacy.html</a>.
        Element 5 employs state-of-the art security arrangements and facilities to prevent security abuse. You can
        read more about this on the Web at <a href="http://www.element5.com/security.html">http://www.element5.com/security.html</a>.
        Element 5 furnishes customer and purchase data directly to JetBrains, and we may share that data inside our
        organization as described above.</p>
</div>

<h4>Online Information Collection</h4>
<br>

<div class="feature">
    <h4>IP Addresses</h4>

    <p>JetBtains uses IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our Website, and to gather usage information. When you
        visit our site, we recognize only your domain name and not your e-mail address. The only way we will ever obtain
        your e-mail address is if you give it to us by filling out an on-line form or by sending us an e-mail
        message.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature">
    <h4>Cookies</h4>

    <p>We use "cookies" on some (but not all) pages to deliver personalized content or to tailor our information
        offerings or responses according to the way you use the site, and/or your current context on the site. We do not
        use cookies to gather or transmit any personally identifiable information about you.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature">
    <h4>Registration, Subscription, and Support Forms</h4>

    <p>Our site includes electronic forms that you may choose to fill out to request information or support, or to
        register to obtain trial licenses for JetBrains products, or to participate in product Early Access Programs, or
        to subscribe to our Announcements newsletter. If you choose to send us information via these forms, this enables
        us to send you requested information, product licenses, product information, news, or notice of special
        promotions, or to respond to your support questions.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature">
    <h4>Data Protection</h4>

    <p>JetBrains takes precautions to ensure the safety and confidentiality of the information we collect via our
        Website. We employ the latest data security technologies including firewalls, encryption, password protection,
        intrusion monitoring, and other techniques to keep your information as safe as modern networking technology can
        make it.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature">
    <h4>Use of E-mail Addresses</h4>

    <p>If you choose to give us your e-mail address, we will communicate with you via e-mail. We will not share your
        e-mail address with others outside JetBrains and its approved contractors and resellers. You can choose not to
        receive any more e-mail at any time.</p>

    <p>Depending on which e-mail program you use and how it is configured, information about you may be sent
        automatically when you send us e-mail. JetBrains has no control over this and recommends that you consult your
        system administrator if you have concerns about what information is being sent by your e-mail program.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature">
    <h4>Online Surveys</h4>

    <p>We may occasionally conduct online surveys that may ask you for demographic information (your location, position,
        tool use, etc.) If the online survey collects contact data such as your e-mail address (although generally they
        do not), we will use that data to send you further information only if the form specifically asks for your
        permission and you give it. You are free to revoke any such permission at any time.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature">
    <h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>

    <p>The JetBrains Web site contains links to other sites. JetBrains is not responsible for the privacy practices or
        the content of these linked Web sites.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature">
    <h4>Choice/Opt-Out</h4>

    <p>You can opt out of receiving e-mail communications from JetBrains at any time. You only need to e-mail us to have
        your name and details removed from our e-mail list or registration database. Please allow 7 business days for
        the removal to be processed.</p>
</div>

<h4>Inquiries and Feedback</h4>

<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, or if you wish to inspect or update the information we hold
    about you, please feel free to contact us at:
