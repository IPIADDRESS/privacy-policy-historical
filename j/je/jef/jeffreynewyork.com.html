This tool allows us to personalize our ads based on your shopping experience with us. We do not share any of your personal information, including your shopping history, with Facebook. The tool lets Jeffrey convert your e-mail address to a unique number that Facebook uses to match to unique numbers Facebook generates from e-mail addresses of its users.

<h5><a name="social_media_interactions"></a><strong>Social Media Interactions</strong></h5>

<p class="infoTXT">Jeffrey invites you to socialize and share your fashion inspiration, finds and purchases with your friends using Social Media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram. If you choose to use these tools, you may be sharing certain profile elements, including your comments. This sharing is subject to each social media program's privacy policies. We also use Facebook Social Plugins to allow Facebook to share information and friends' activities with its members while they are on our website. For example, Social Plugins allow Facebook to show you and your friends' "Likes" on our product pages if you are logged into Facebook while shopping at Jeffreynewyork.com. Jeffrey does not receive or control any of the content from Facebook Social Plugins. To remove a Facebook "Like" through Jeffrey, place your cursor in the "grayed out" Like button and click on the "X" that appears. This removes the "Like" from your Facebook Page, as well as from Jeffrey websites. You can also delete comments made while at Jeffreynewyork.com from your Facebook Page.</p>
