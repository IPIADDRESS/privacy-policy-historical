Jesus Daily&nbsp;does not sell, rent, trade, or share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties except as disclosed within this privacy policy. “Personally identifiable information” includes any information that could personally identify you, including but not limited to your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.</p><p>While the Jesus Daily website and related services is available to, and can be used by, anyone with internet access, the website and related services are intended to be accessed and used by individuals from the United States of America, and Jesus Daily, LLC hereby disclaims any representations and/or warranties it makes in this Privacy Policy that such policy satisfies the requirements of users accessing and using the Service from outside the United States of America. Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize Jesus Daily to use your information in, and as a result to transfer it to and store it in,&nbsp;the United States, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.</p><p><strong>BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ARE HEREBY CONSENTING TO JESUS DAILY’S COLLECTION, USE, DISCLOSURE, TRANSFER AND STORAGE OF INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></p><p><strong>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SITE</strong><br> <strong><br> EMAIL PRODUCT OR PETITION TO A FRIEND</strong></p><p>If you choose to email a product description to a friend, we will ask you for your name and email address, and for your recipient’s name and email address. If you choose to send a petition description to a friend, only the friend’s email address is required. We will automatically send your chosen recipient(s) a one-time email to view the product or petition. Jesus Daily&nbsp;does not store, sell, trade or otherwise use any name or email address you share here for purposes other than to deliver your message.</p><p><strong>E-NEWSLETTERS</strong></p><p>If you wish to subscribe to our e-newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send a periodic email to you. For some audio book downloads and giveaways, your email may be shared with the original publishing company. We provide unsubscribe options with each and every email sent in this manner. This is also summarized in the&nbsp;“Choice and Opt-out”&nbsp;section below.</p><p><strong>SERVICE-RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong></p><p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.</p><p><strong>LINKS/SOCIAL MEDIA WIDGETS/ELECTRONIC LOG FILES/COOKIES/CLEAR GIFS/WEB BEACONS/RETARGETING</strong></p><p>Our Web site may contain links to other Web sites, including sponsor sites and other philanthropic sites. Jesus Daily&nbsp;is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites and encourages you to review these companies’ privacy policies.</p><p><strong>ACTIVELY SUBMITTED INFORMATION</strong></p><p>For most of the browsing on our service, you are not required to actively submit any personally identifiable information. However, in the following instances, you are required to actively submit your information: (1) when you opt-in to our email list for marketing communications; (2) when you want to contact us via electronic means or website submission; or (3) if available, when you purchase something through our e-commerce store.</p><p><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA WIDGETS</strong></p><p>Our Web site includes social media features such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, “Share this” button, and other interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p><p><strong>ELECTRONIC LOG FILES</strong></p><p>As is true of most sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in electronic log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, approximate geographic location, the type of mobile device you are using, mobile device IDs or other persistent identifiers, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.<br> We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. We use this information to understand how our websites are used to better meet the needs of our visitors and customers. We use IP address to identify and block malicious behavior like click fraud or denial of service attacks. We may also use this data to conduct statistical analyses on visitors’ usage patterns and other aggregated data.</p><p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p><p>We use electronic cookies to recognize your computer as a returning visitor. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.</p><p>For an enhanced site visitor experience, we may also use a cookie to store your click history. This would only be used to display your click history to you and is purely optional.</p><p>Third party ad servers and ad networks also use cookies to serve ads at the Jesus Daily&nbsp;Web site. For example, Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you based on your visit to Jesus Daily&nbsp;and other sites on the Internet. These third party ad servers automatically receive your IP address when this occurs. We have no access to or control over these third party cookies.</p><p>You may disable cookies from your browser’s configuration menu at any time. Information gathered by Jesus Daily&nbsp;cookies is considered personal and proprietary, and is encompassed in our commitment to your privacy and security of data.</p><p>Users may opt out of the use of the Google cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.</p><p><strong>CLEAR GIFS (WEB BEACONS/WEB BUGS)</strong></p><p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that helps us manage content on our site by letting us know which content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p><p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see&nbsp;“Choice and Opt-out.”</p><p>Our third party partners also employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to personally identifiable information.</p><p><strong>BEHAVIORAL TARGETING/RETARGETING</strong></p><p>Jesus Daily&nbsp;partners with a third party ad network to both display advertising on our own Web sites and to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites in order to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests, and to provide you relevant advertising through retargeting when you leave our sites. If you do not want this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here&nbsp;http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/, or by using the&nbsp;NAI opt-out mechanism. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served advertising — you will continue to see general ads that are not targeted to your interests.</p><p>Due to technological limitations at this time, Jesus Daily&nbsp;does not respond to browser Do Not Track signals.</p><p>Jesus Daily&nbsp;constantly uses aggregate and non-personally recognizable data about our customers both internally and using external providers, including Facebook and Google, to try to understand customer concerns and provide better products and promotions. We segment our data and email lists by issue area of concern, and also by type of product purchased, recency, frequency, and monetary value of purchase, which charitable gifts have been given, and other demographic and geographic data.</p><p><strong>THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS</strong></p><p>We may also receive or collect information about you from our trusted third party service providers. The information you provide to these third party service providers are governed by their separate privacy policies. We are not responsible for, and will assume no liability, for how these service providers use or share any information you have submitted to them. Nevertheless, we treat information we collect or receive from these third party service providers in accordance with the privacy policies set forth herein.</p><p><strong>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p><p>Except where we otherwise obtain your express permission or as otherwise set forth in this policy, we share your personally identifiable information with third parties only under the limited circumstances stated below:<br> Information is subject to disclosure in response to judicial or other governmental subpoenas, warrants and court orders served on us in accordance with their terms, as otherwise required by applicable law, or in response to requests by law enforcement.</p><p>Information is subject to disclosure to protect our rights or property, protect its legitimate business interests, to enforce the provisions of our Privacy Policy, and/or to prevent harm to you or others.</p><p>Information may be disclosed to carefully selected third-party service providers in order to provide services to you, such as to: provide customer service; send or email marketing communications; monitor the activity of our service; and conduct surveys. We will share your information with our carefully selected third-party services providers on a confidential basis. These service providers are prohibited from using your information for any purpose other than providing our services.</p><p>In the event that all or substantially all of Jesus Daily, LLC’s assets are acquired by a third party through sale, merger, or otherwise, your information will be transferred to that third party, subject to the same terms and conditions of the then-existing Privacy Policy for the site. This section remains subject to any restrictions placed by third party vendors.</p><p><strong>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN</strong></p><p>Jesus Daily&nbsp;does not knowingly collect individually identifiable information from or about children under 13. However, we hereby advise all visitors to our site under the age of 13 not to disclose or provide any personally identifiable information on our site. If Jesus Daily&nbsp;later learns that we have personally identifiable information about a child under 13, we will take steps to remove that child’s information from our databases to the extent technologically possible. If you have questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@jesusdaily.com">admin@jesusdaily.com</a></p><p><strong>UPDATING/ACCESSING/AMENDING/CORRECTING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</strong></p><p>If your personally identifiable information changes, you may contact us to amend, correct, or delete it. We will respond to your request within 1 business day. See below for our contact information.</p><p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
