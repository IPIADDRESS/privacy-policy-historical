LAST UPDATED: Mar 19, 2015<br>
<br>
Egg.fm wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose Personal 
Information and Non-Personal Information (each as defined below). This Privacy 
Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect 
through our website located at www.egg.fm. This Privacy Policy does not address 
the collection, use or disclosure of information by any third parties.<br>
<br>
By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. 
If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please 
do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy without 
prior notice. You can find out when this Privacy Policy was last revised by 
referring to the "Last Updated" legend at the top of this page. Any changes to 
our Privacy Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Privacy 
Policy on the Site. Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your 
acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy then in effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. What Types of Information Do We Collect from You?<br>
<br>
Personal Information is information that identifies an individual. In order for 
you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for 
example, to receive white papers, participate in certain forums on the Site or 
sign-up for the Egg.fm Service), we may require that you furnish Personal 
Information. We collect Personal Information from you, such as your name, postal 
address, telephone number and email address, only when you voluntarily provide 
it to us. We may also combine Personal Information you provide to us with 
publicly available information, such as your organization's name, in the event 
you provide us with an email address from your organization. Non-Personal 
Information is aggregated information, demographic information and any other 
information that does not reveal an individual's specific identity. <br>
<br>
- Environmental Variables.<br>
<br>
We may collect certain environmental variables, such as your MAC address, 
computer type, screen resolution, OS version and browser type and version. These 
environmental variables are collected by most websites and can be used to 
optimize your experience on the Site.<br>
<br>
- Cookies.<br>
<br>
We and service providers acting on our behalf may set and access cookies on your 
computer. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification 
number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of your computer so 
that the website administrator may identify your computer and passively track 
its activities on the website. This unique number identifies your web browser to 
our computer system. Cookies allow us to automatically remember your web browser 
when you use the Site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and they are 
currently used on most major websites. It is possible to adjust your web browser 
preferences to alert you when a cookie is sent to your hard drive, or to refuse 
cookies altogether. While we do not require you to use cookies, certain parts of 
the Site will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse all 
cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit 
http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.<br>
<br>
- Web Beacons.<br>
<br>
Web beacons, also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image 
files that we, or service providers acting on our behalf, may place in our Web 
pages, in our advertisements and in our emails. Working in conjunction with 
cookies, web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who 
have visited a specific Site page or section, clicked on one of our 
advertisements, or opened or acted upon an email. They also tell us the number 
of times advertisements or pages are displayed. This allows us to measure the 
performance of our Site, our advertising and our email campaigns.<br>
<br>
- Information That You Provide.<br>
<br>
We may also collect Non-Personal Information, such as your interests, geographic 
location and website address, when you provide it to us. Unless combined with 
Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you. In 
addition, we may aggregate Personal Information in a manner such that the end 
product does not identify you or any other Site user. Such aggregate information 
is considered Non-Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. IP Addresses.<br>
<br>
Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned 
to the computer you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and in 
many cases, IP addresses are shared by multiple people. This number is 
identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit 
the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) you visited. 
Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done 
automatically by many websites.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. How Does Egg.fm Use Information Collected From Me?<br>
<br>
Personal Information. We may use Personal Information: <br>
<br>
- to fulfill your requests, such as to create an Egg.fm account, send a 
requested white paper or send online video updates;<br>
- to operate the Egg.fm Service, to send you important information regarding the 
Site and issues specifically affecting the Egg.fm and your use of the 
Egg.fm Service, including changes to Site terms, conditions and policies. 
Because this information may be important, you may not opt out of receiving it;<br>
- to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions from us and/or 
our marketing partners that we believe may be of interest to you;<br>
- for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing 
new products, enhancing our Site, improving our services, identifying usage 
trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Non-Personal Information.<br>
<br>
Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use 
such information for any purpose, at our sole discretion, unless otherwise noted 
in this Privacy Policy. In addition, we reserve the right to share Non-Personal 
Information with affiliates and other third parties, for any purpose. In some 
instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information 
(such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we do combine 
any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, we will treat the 
combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined. <br>
<br>
- Delivery of Online Advertising.<br>
<br>
We may use third party ad serving technology to help us deliver ads on the Site 
or to educate users on ad serving technology. This technology may use 
information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone 
number) about your visit to the Site in order to identify and display 
advertisements that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving these 
advertisements, a unique cookie may be placed and/or recognized on your browser. <br>
<br>
- Third Party Advertisements. <br>
<br>
Third parties may display advertisements on the Site or offer you products and 
services in connection with the Site. Any such party's use of cookies and other 
technologies is subject to such party's own privacy policy. Third parties that 
are not our service providers do not have access to our cookies.<br>
<br>
<br>
5. IP Addresses.<br>
<br>
We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping 
diagnose server problems and administering the Site. We may also use and 
disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose 
Personal Information. Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files 
and related information as Non-Personal Information, except where we are 
required to do otherwise under applicable law.<br>

<br>
We may disclose Personal Information: <br>

Egg.fm to upload, manage and publish videos to a customer's own website or to 
third party websites. Please note that any information you disclose through 
videos uploaded via the Egg.fm Service may become public information and may be 
available to visitors to the website where they are posted and to the general 
public. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose 
Personal Information, or any other sensitive information, via the Egg.fm 
Service. We are not responsible for the use of any Personal Information you

responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third 
parties, or of other websites or services operated by third parties. Your 
activities, including your provision of Personal Information, with any such 
third parties or such third partie's websites or services will be governed by 
the privacy policy of such third parties. The inclusion of a link on the Site

are not responsible for the use of any Personal Information you disclose to 
third party sites or services.<br>
<br>
Security. We use reasonable organizational, 
technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our 
control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage 
system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please do not send us sensitive 
information through email. If you have reason to believe that your interaction 
with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any 
account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately 
notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the "Contacting Us" 
section below.<br>

Changing or Suppressing Personal Information. If you would like to request to

Information that has been previously provided to us, you may contact us by email. We will respond to your request in accordance with 
applicable law. For your protection, we will only implement requests with 
respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address 
that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity 
before implementing your request. You also may review, correct and update 
certain information that you provided by logging into your Egg.fm account and editing your profile information. In each event, you must clearly 
indicate the information that you wish to have changed or suppressed. We will 
endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in 
compliance with applicable law. We may need to retain certain information for 
record-keeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will 
remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed. 
Finally, we are not responsible for removing or suppressing information from the 
databases of third parties with whom we have already shared your Personal 
Information, or limiting their use of your Personal Information. If you wish to 
change or suppress information provided to an affiliate or third party, please 
contact them directly.<br>
<br>
Retention Period. We will retain your Personal Information for the period 
necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a 
longer retention period is permitted or required by law.<br>
