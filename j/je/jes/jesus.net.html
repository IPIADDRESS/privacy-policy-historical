<h1>Privacy Policy for www.Christ.com</h1>


The Lord of Hosts website (www.Christ.com and its associated domains), and its advertisers and affiliates, are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.
<br><br>
<hr width="50%">
<br><br>
We require names and addresses, including e-mail addresses, for all premium services. Premium services are those services available through the Lord of Hosts website that require payment. Any personal information collected at the Lord of Hosts website to establish accounts for premium services is kept in confidence, and is not made available to third parties.  This information is used to contact you for billing purposes, and for sending other notices regarding service.
<br><br>
Information may be voluntarily posted in the public areas by website visitors.  This information may include your e-mail address and other contact information.  The public areas include areas like the bulletin board system (BBS or message board), prayer request and praise report pages, biographies, devotionals, and other areas where website users voluntarily post information. It is important to realize that any information posted in the public areas can be read by anybody on the internet. Do not submit personal information for posting in the public areas of the website unless you intend to make this information publically available.
<br><br>
As stated on our prayer request and praise report submission pages, we routinely delete last names, or names that appear to be last names, before posting the messages, even though the user may wish to have the full names posted.  This is to protect the privacy of the individuals involved.  If you would like to reveal your last name to others on the internet, it will have to be done via private e-mail.
<br><br>
The Lord of Hosts website, as well as most sites on the Internet, uses "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. The Lord of Hosts website does not use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a 
text string, along with a unique identifier, that may be used to store information about your interaction with the website. This information is stored in a cookie file on your computer.
<br><br>
The most common example of cookie usage on the Lord of Hosts website is found in the <a href="http://www.Christ.com/audiolinks.html">Audio Surfboard</a>.  The top frame of the Audio Surfboard allows you to preselect a custom list of favorite links and audio programs.  If you choose to generate a custom list of audio links on the surfboard, then your selections are stored in a cookie on your computer.  Your personal selection of audio links is not stored on the Lord of Hosts website.
<br><br>
Other banner ads on the Lord of Hosts website may also store cookies on your computer. This information is used for targeted advertising by the individual banner advertisers.
<br><br>
While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience, you may choose at any time to disable cookies on your PC. If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually
delete your cookies, and disable their use while browsing. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information.
