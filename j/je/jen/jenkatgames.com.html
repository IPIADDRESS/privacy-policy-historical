									<p>Last Updated April 28, 2014</p><p>We have created this Privacy Policy in order to show our commitment 
to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and 
dissemination practices. This policy covers all Jenkat Media, Inc. 
properties including, but not limited to the following domains: 
http://www.jenkatmedia.com, http://www.jenkatgames.com,http://www.gamehug.com, Jenkat Games Arcade and Jenkat Games Arcade Plus, and all other websites and products owned and/or operated by Jenkat Media, Inc. (\\\"the Network\\\").</p>

<h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Any personal information that you provide to our Jenkat Media website(s) will stay safe and secure. </p>

<h3>INFORMATION THAT WE MAY COLLECT
FROM OUR USERS</h3>

<p>We may collect the following
information when you sign up for a service: </p>

<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;- First name, last name, e-mail, postal address, country, phone 
number, gender, birth date, age, username, zip code, password, and game 
category preferences. </li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;- For processing transactions, we also collect either credit card
 information or bank information, depending on your form of payment. </li></ul>

<h3>IP Address:</h3>

<p>When a user visits any website owned or operated by Jenkat Media, 
Inc., we may collect the IP address that requested the display of one of
 our sites. This address is collected primarily for two purposes. The 
first purpose is to exercise our ability to restrict access to the site 
by users who have violated our Terms of Service. The second purpose is 
to support our advertising partners, so that the partners will be able 
to accurately count the number of unique visitors to our sites who may 
have viewed a given advertisement. When a user accesses a Network 
website, our web server may also automatically collect and store the 
user\\\'s domain name, the date and time of access to the site and the 
Internet address of the website that linked you to our site.</p>

<h3>Sign Up and Survey information:</h3>

<p>Any information you provide to us
as part of your use of any Jenkat Media website will be stored as entered. </p>

<h3>Cookies:</h3>

<p>The sole purpose of cookies is to enhance your online experience. 
Cookies are small data files that are stored on your computer by 
websites. Through your Web browser, cookies are only used by the website
 that wrote the cookie. Data stored in a cookie from Jenkat Media is 
only accessible by the Jenkat Media websites. Data in cookies may be 
read to authenticate user sessions or provide services.  The information
 in our cookies is kept private and secure.  </p>

<h3>USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Your username, e-mail address, and password will be used to uniquely 
identify you as a user on any Jenkat Media website. We may use or 
display your username for such purposes including, but not limited to, 
rankings, competitions, lottery winnings, chat identification, or game 
high scores.  </p>

<p>Other identifying information collected during the sign up process or
 through other voluntary means (e.g., via surveys) may be used to 
calculate aggregate demographics figures.</p>

<p>We use the information that we collect from users in a variety of 
ways, including to improve the content of the website, to address user 
preferences and to attract new users, to track user trends and patterns 
on the Internet so that users may be informed about products and 
services of interest and, in some instances, to properly credit third 
parties that have referred users to the site. Stored information is also
 used to pre-populate information fields for purchases, contests or 
promotions.<br>
<br>
Our advertisers and marketing partners who contract directly with the 
Network are required to confirm that they will comply with the Network\\\'s
 Privacy Policy with respect to information collected through ads 
displayed on any Network site. Third-party advertising companies use 
cookies to measure and improve the effectiveness of their clients\\\' ads. 
To do this, advertisers may use anonymous information about a user\\\'s 
visit to a website (as well as other websites) including what banner ad 
was shown, the date and time it was shown, the cookie and the IP 
address. This information may also be used for online preference 
marketing purposes. The Network does not control these third party 
cookies and users of the Network should check the privacy policy of the 
advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses 
cookies.   </p>

<p>A pixel tag is a tiny image inserted in a webpage and used to record 
the number and types of views for that page. The Network may allow third
 party pixel tags to be present on the Network for purposes of 
advertising, providing services or data and statistics collection. You 
can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, 
block third party cookies or block all cookies. However, by blocking all
 cookies you may not have access to certain features on the Network.  
Visit Network Advertising Initiative\\\'s (\\\"NAI\\\") gateway opt-out site 
www.networkadvertising.org to review the privacy policies of third-party
 advertising companies and/or opt-out of third-party advertising 
cookies. 
<br>
<br>
</p><p>In the event that Jenkat Media, Inc. merges with another company 
or transfers or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party, 
all information stored on the web server would be included in the 
merger, transfer or sale. Also, if required by law, information may be 
disclosed to a third party. <br>
<br>
Jenkat Media, Inc. reserves the right to change its privacy policy at any time.
</p>
<h3>SECURITY OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</h3>

<p>All data that we collect is stored on one or more secure database 
servers that cannot be accessed from outside our corporate network. 
Outside of our network, the only access to this data is that provided 
through our Jenkat Media websites. Through our sites, access to personal
 information is completely controlled by user-defined e-mail addresses 
and passwords. Within our corporation, access to data is secured through
 a private user ID and password known only to key personnel who maintain
 the database. 
</p>
<p>
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, the Network will get your 
permission before we use any personally identifiable information you 
provide to us in a way that is inconsistent with the purpose for which 
it was submitted or share your personally identifiable information with 
third parties that are not affiliated with the Network.
</p>

<h3>E-MAIL/OPT-OUT</h3>

<p>When you sign up as a Jenkat Media user, or download any software 
from Jenkat Media, Inc., by default the option will be selected to allow
 us to communicate with you via e-mail about news, games, special 
offers, and events. You have the option to uncheck or check a box during
 the sign up process that will prevent this, although by doing so you 
are potentially asking us to not inform you of events and prize awards 
that may have tangible value to you. Any e-mail we send to you will 
contain information about opting-out of any further mailings, and all 
Jenkat Media websites have areas where you may manually opt-out of 
receiving further communications. Jenkat Media treats each of its 
consumer offerings individually, so if you have opted to receive 
mailings from more than one business entity, if you want to unsubscribe 
you must do so from each entity individually. 
</p>

<p>A second communication option is chosen by default, allowing Jenkat 
Media to share your information with trusted partners who may also 
choose to communicate with you. You also have the choice to uncheck the 
box for this option during the sign up process.</p><h3>CHILDREN\'S PRIVACY</h3><p>Jenkat Games is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. Jenkat Games does not permit the registration on the Sites by, and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13 years of age. &nbsp;In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from our records.</p><p></p><h3>FACEBOOK PLATFORM</h3><p></p><p></p><div><p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;">This site makes use of Facebook Platform which lets you log
into other applications and websites using your Facebook account. When you log
in using Facebook, Facebook gives Jenkat Media your User ID, but they do not
share your email address or password with Jenkat Media without you giving
permission.<br></p><p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;">If you already have an account with Jenkat Media, you may
also be able to connect that account with your Facebook account. This can be
done using techniques like an \\\"email hash\\\", which is similar to
searching for someone on Facebook using an email address. The email addresses
in this case are encrypted, so no email addresses are actually shared between
Facebook and Jenkat Media.<br></p><p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;">How It Works<br></p><p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;">The website (Jenkat Media) sends over an encrypted version
of your email address, and Facebook matches it with a database of email
addresses that they have also encrypted. If there is a match, then Facebook
tells the website the User ID associated with the email address. This way, when
you log into our website using Facebook, we can link your Facebook account to
your account on Jenkat Media.</p><p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;">About Social Plugins<br></p><p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;">When
you go to a game or application, or connect with a website using the Facebook
Platform, Facebook gives the game, application, or website (sometimes referred
to as just \\\"Applications\\\" or \\\"Apps\\\") your <u><span style="\&quot;\\&quot;color:blue\\&quot;\&quot;">User ID</span></u>, as well your friends\\\' User IDs (or your
friend list).</p><p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;">Your
friend list helps us make your experience more social because it lets you find
your friends on our website. Your User ID helps us personalize your experience
because it can connect your account on our website with your Facebook account,
and it can access your <u><span style="\&quot;\\&quot;color:blue\\&quot;\&quot;">public information</span></u>.
This includes the information you choose to make public, as well as information
that is always publicly available. If the application needs additional
information, it will have to ask you for specific permission.<br></p><p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;">The <u><span style="\&quot;\\&quot;color:blue\\&quot;\&quot;">Apps you Use</span></u> setting in Facebook lets you control
the applications you use. You can see the permissions you have given these
applications, as well as the last time an application accessed your
information. You can also remove applications you no longer want, or turn off
all Facebook applications.<br></p><p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;">Jenkat
Media might also ask for permission to share specific information with the
games and applications you use on our site (such as your public information).
If you say okay, we will not be able to access any other information about you
without asking specific permission from you or your friends.<br></p><p class="\&quot;\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\&quot;"><o:p></o:p></p></div><p></p>

<h3>OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>

<p>Your Web browser or client software that you use to access Jenkat 
Media may transmit certain geographic information and information 
regarding the capabilities or features of your computer and/or software 
to us. We may also track other types of information, such as what games a
 user plays, how long our users have been members of any Jenkat Media 
businesses or programs, the last time a user visited Jenkat Media 
websites, and whether a user has won any of our games, lotteries, 
jackpots, or contests. We may use this information to calculate 
aggregate statistics about our user community or for security purposes, 
and may provide such information to advertisers and/or partners in
