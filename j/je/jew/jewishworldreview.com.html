<h2>Privacy Statement for Jewish World Review</h2>
<p>
<input type="hidden" name="page" value="4">
 Jewish World Review has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices. </p>

<p>We take your privacy seriously. Information which you provide us is not passed on to others, save on an ‘aggregate basis.’ This means that we will only say "we have X thousand subscribers, including X in [your country and/or your age group].", but not disclose information about you in particular. Our subscription lists have been secured, as have all our registration tables, in order to keep your information private.</p>

<p>We record your IP address when you visit. The IP address indicates which computer network you are using, and in some cases (usually in a corporate setting) your unique machine. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to gather broad demographic information about our users. </p>

<p>Our site delivers a cookie to your browser, if you permit it in your browser settings. A ‘cookie’ is a small packet of information stored by your web browser. It is unique to each user, and this permits us to deliver content specific to your interests. </p>

<p>Our site's registration form requests contact information (like their name and email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact information from the registration form to offer you relevant information on Jewish programming, both on the web and via email. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.</p>

<p>Our site uses an "order form" for credit-card donations, and our bookstore uses an order form for purchasing. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services.</p>

<p>Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary.</p>

<p>We may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. </p>
