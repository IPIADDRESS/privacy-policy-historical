        <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
        <p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in
        the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell
        your personal information to third parties.</p>
        <p>We may provide your personal information to companies that provide
        services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your
        order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to
        use your personal information only as necessary to provide these
        services to us.</p>

        <p>We may also disclose your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or
            similar legal process</li>
            <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
            protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,

            <li>if BeachMint is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of

        <h3>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
        <p>We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences
        and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general usage
        and volume statistical information that does not include personal
        information.</p>

        <h3>Web beacons</h3>
        <p>Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons
        (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies
        to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and
        may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and
        links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the
        effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
        <p>We use a third party to gather information about how you and
        others use our Web site. For example, we will know how many users
        access a specific page and which links they clicked on. We use this
        aggregated information to understand and optimize how our site is
        used.</p>

        <h3>Targeted Advertising</h3>
        <p>Targeted Advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising)
        uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior
        such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made.
        Third parties collect this information by placing or accessing cookies
        in your browser when you visit this, or other, websites.  If you would
        like to learn more about the third party advertisers that may be aware
        of the fact that you visit this website, and to understand your choices
        about having such advertisers' cookies turned off, please visit
        www.networkadvertising.org.</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.
        When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number)
        on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information
        using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
        <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the
        personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and
        once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet,
        or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore,
        we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you
        can contact us at customercare@beachmint.com</p>

        Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your
        identity and provide you the option to share certain personal
        information with us such as your name and email address to
        pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect
        give you the option to post information about your activities on
        this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your
        network.</p>
