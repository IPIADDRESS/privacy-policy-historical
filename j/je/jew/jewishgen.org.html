<p>JewishGen has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate
our firm commitment to privacy.  The following discloses the information
gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: </p>


<h3>Site Use</h3>

<p>All information contained on this site is being provided by
JewishGen, Inc. as a public service for the furtherance of your
<b>personal</b> genealogical research.  Any information contained
as part of any database, text file or HTML file is not intended
nor should it be used for the solicitation of paid research,
solicitation for contributions or support for a non-JewishGen
project or for any commercial use, school related projects,
term papers or interviews for the purpose of publication without
the express written permission of the appropriate copyright
holder. </p>


<h3>Information Automatically Logged</h3>

<p>For purposes of analyzing the traffic we receive at our Web site, we
log your domain name.  For example, if you are an America On-line user,
we retain that there was a visit from a AOL user, but we do not even
know your complete e-mail address. </p>


<h3>Use of Your Personal Information</h3>

<ul>

<li>
<p><b>JewishGen Discussion Group</b>:
If you submit messages to the <a href="DiscussionGroup.htm">JewishGen
Discussion Group</a>, it will include your name and e-mail address.
This information is retained in the
<a href="/wconnect/wc.isa?jg~jgsys~archpop">Discussion Group archives</a>.
JewishGen does not use this information, but we cannot prevent other persons
from using it.  In fact, the purpose of the archives is to allow other
genealogists to contact you if you have provided information of interest
to them.  The JewishGen Discussion Group is also mirrored to the Usenet
newsgroup <a href="news:soc.genealogy.jewish">soc.genealogy.jewish</a>,
thus all posted messages (which include the name and e-mail address
of the poster) are available to those who reads newsgroups.  We have
no way of preventing anyone from using this information to contact you.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>JewishGen Family Finder (JGFF)</b>: If you participate in the
<a href="/jgff">JewishGen Family Finder (JGFF)</a> project,
you will provide your name, e-mail address, postal address and
telephone number to JewishGen.  When you enter your address data,
you determine which parts of your address information will be
displayed to other users of the JGFF.  The information you decide
to have displayed can be captured for uses beyond our control, by
anyone searching the JGFF.  To maximize your privacy, without
lessening your chances of being contacted by someone with the
same research interest, you can opt to display only your Researcher
Code.  When you use this method, the contact is processed through
our third party blind contact system, which can be effective in
protecting you from spam. </p>

<p>JewishGen may provide JGFF information, on a very limited basis,
to other genealogy groups, but only if you have given us explicit
permission to do so.  For example, if a group requests a list of
all persons with interests in Lithuania, and in our judgement their
planned use is to further the interests of Jewish genealogy, we
provide such a list.  If we turn down the request, the group is
still capable of gathering the names and addresses by capturing
your name and address information from the computer screen as
described above. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Family Tree of the Jewish People (FTJP)</b>:
If you participate in the <a href="/gedcom">Family Tree of the Jewish
People (FTJP)</a> by submitting a GEDCOM file, the personal information
you have already provided to the JewishGen Family Finder (JGFF) is
automatically linked.
This information consists of your researcher code, your e-mail address
and postal address as well as a telephone number if supplied.  None of
this private information is provided to anyone.  If an FTJP user wishes
to communicate with you, we forward their initial message to you without
giving them your name or address.  It is your decision to reply or not.
</p>

<p>If at any future date JewishGen determines that the FTJP will be used
for anything other than personal genealogical pursuits, you will be
notified and can then determine if you wish to participate or not. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Contributions</b>: If you contribute money to JewishGen through
our <a href="/JewishGen-erosity">JewishGen-erosity program</a>, we
ask if JewishGen may place your name in the list of contributors
displayed on our web site.  You have the option of chosing Yes or No.
If you select Yes, your name will be added to the list of contributors;
If you select No, you are listed as 'Anonymous'.  In either case,
we do not share any other information you provide to us with any
other person or organization. </p>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>External Links</h3>

of the privacy practices or content of such Web sites. </p>
