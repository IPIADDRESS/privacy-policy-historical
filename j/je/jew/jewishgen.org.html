<p>JewishGen has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate 
our firm commitment to privacy.  The following discloses the information 
gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: </p>


<h3>Site Use</h3>

<p>All information contained on this site is being provided by
JewishGen, Inc. as a public service for the furtherance of your
<b>personal</b> genealogical research.  Any information contained 
as part of any database, text file or HTML file is not intended 
nor should it be used for the solicitation of paid research, 
solicitation for contributions or support for a non-JewishGen 
project or for any commercial use, school related projects, 
term papers or interviews for the purpose of publication without 
the express written permission of the appropriate copyright 
holder. </p>


<h3>Information Automatically Logged</h3>

<p>For purposes of analyzing the traffic we receive at our Web site, we 
log your domain name.  For example, if you are an America On-line user, 
we retain that there was a visit from a AOL user, but we do not even 
know your complete e-mail address. </p>


<h3>Use of Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>If you submit messages to the JewishGen Discussion group, it will
include your name and e-mail address. We retain this information in
the Discussion Group archives.  We do not use this information, but
we cannot prevent other persons from using it.  In fact, the purpose
of the archives is to allow other genealogists to contact you if you 
have provided information of interest to them. </p>

<p>If you participate in the JewishGen Family Finder (JGFF) project,
you will provide your name, e-mail address, postal address and
telephone number.  When you enter your data, you determine 
which address information will be displayed to any user of the JGFF.  
The information you decide to have displayed can be captured for uses 
beyond our control by anyone searching the JGFF.  JewishGen may provide 
this information, on a very limited basis, to other genealogy groups, 
but only if you have given us permission to do so.  For example if a 
group requests a list of all persons with interests in Lithuania, and 
in our judgement the planned use is to further the interests of Jewish 
genealogy, we provide such a list.  If we turn down the request, the 
group is still capable of gathering the names and addresses by capturing 
your name and address information from the computer screen as described 
above. </p> 

<p>If you participate in the Family Tree of the Jewish People (FTJP) by 
submitting a GEDCOM file, the personal information you have already 
provided to the JewishGen Family Finder (JGFF) is automatically linked. 
This information consists of your researcher code, your e-mail address 
and postal address as well as a telephone number if supplied.  None of 
this private information is provided to anyone.  If an FTJP user wishes 
to communicate with you, we forward the initial message without
giving your name or address.  It is your decision to reply or not.  </p>

<p>If at any future date JewishGen determines that the FTJP will be used 
for anything other than personal genealogical pursuits, you will be 
notified and can then determine if you wish to participate or not. </p>

<p>If you contribute money to JewishGen through our JewishGen-erosity
program, we do not share your name or other information provided to
us with any other person or organization. </p>


<h3>External Links</h3>

<p>This site contains links to other sites.  JewishGen has no knowledge
of the privacy practices or content of such Web sites. </p>
