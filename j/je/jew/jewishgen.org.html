<h1><font color="#800080">Disclaimer, Site Use and Privacy Policy</font></h1>
</center>

<p>JewishGen has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate
our firm commitment to privacy.&nbsp;  The following discloses the information
gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: </p>


<h3>Site Use</h3>

<p>All information contained on this site is being provided by
JewishGen, Inc. as a public service for the furtherance of your
<b>personal</b> genealogical research.&nbsp;   Any information contained
as part of any database, text file or HTML file is not intended
nor should it be used for the solicitation of paid research,
solicitation for contributions or support for a non-JewishGen
project or for any commercial use, school related projects,
term papers or interviews for the purpose of publication without
the express written permission of the appropriate copyright
holder.</p>

<p>The photographs and images ("Works") contained in this website are
copyrighted by third parties from whom we have obtained permission to
publish their Works on JewishGen's website.&nbsp;
JewishGen cannot convey the right to use these Works in any form;
they may not be copied or used without prior permission from the holder
of the underlying copyright.&nbsp;
For information concerning permissions, please contact JewishGen
at the e-mail address below.</p>


<h3>Information Automatically Logged</h3>

<p>For purposes of analyzing the traffic we receive at our Web site,
we log your domain name and IP address.&nbsp;  For example, if you
are an America On-line user, we retain that there was a visit from
an AOL user, but we do not know your e-mail address.</p>


<h3>Use of Your Personal Information</h3>

<ul>

<li>
<p><b>JewishGen Discussion Group</b>:
If you submit messages to the <a href="DiscussionGroup.htm">JewishGen
Discussion Group</a>, it will include your name and e-mail address.
This information is retained in the
<a href="/wconnect/wc.isa?jg~jgsys~archpop">Discussion Group archives</a>.&nbsp;
JewishGen does not use this information, but we cannot prevent other persons
from using it.&nbsp;  In fact, the purpose of the archives is to allow other
genealogists to contact you if you have provided information of interest
to them.&nbsp;  The JewishGen Discussion Group is also mirrored to the Usenet
newsgroup <a href="news:soc.genealogy.jewish">soc.genealogy.jewish</a>,
thus all posted messages (which include the name and e-mail address
of the poster) are available to those who reads newsgroups.&nbsp;  We have
no way of preventing anyone from using this information to contact you.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>JewishGen Family Finder (JGFF)</b>:&nbsp;
If you participate in the <a href="/jgff">JewishGen Family Finder (JGFF)</a>
project, you provide your name, e-mail address, postal address and
telephone number to JewishGen.&nbsp;  When you enter your address
data, you determine which parts of your address information, if any,
will be displayed to other registered users of the JGFF.&nbsp;
In no cases will your e-mail address or telephone number ever
be displayed.&nbsp;
The information you decide to have displayed can be captured for
uses beyond our control, by anyone searching the JGFF.&nbsp;
To maximize your privacy, without lessening your chances of being
contacted by someone with the same research interest, you can opt
to display only your JewishGen ID Number.</p>

<p>JewishGen may provide JGFF information, on a very limited basis,
to other genealogy groups, but only if you have given us explicit
permission to do so.&nbsp;  For example, if a group requests a list of
all persons with interests in Lithuania, and in our judgement their
planned use is to further the interests of Jewish genealogy, we
provide such a list.&nbsp;  If we turn down the request, the group is
still capable of gathering the names and addresses by capturing
your name and address information from the computer screen as
described above.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Family Tree of the Jewish People (FTJP)</b>:&nbsp;
If you participate in the <a href="/gedcom">Family Tree of the Jewish
People (FTJP)</a> by submitting a GEDCOM file,
none of your contact information is provided to anyone.&nbsp;
If a user searching the FTJP wishes to communicate with you,
we forward their initial message to you without giving them
your name, email address, or postal address.&nbsp;
It is your decision to reply or not.
</p>

<p>If at any future date JewishGen determines that the FTJP will be used
for anything other than personal genealogical pursuits, you will be
notified and can then determine if you wish to participate or not.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Contributions</b>:&nbsp; If you contribute money to JewishGen
through our <a href="/JewishGen-erosity">JewishGen-erosity program</a>,
we ask if JewishGen may place your name in the list of contributors
displayed on our web site.&nbsp;  You have the option of chosing
Yes or No.&nbsp; If you select Yes, your name will be added to the
list of contributors; If you select No, you are listed as 'Anonymous'.&nbsp;
In either case, we do not share any other information you provide
to us with any other person or organization.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>External Links</h3>

knowledge of the privacy practices or content of such Web sites.</p>
