        This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by 
        InteSoft Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies. Sometimes, we may post 
        product specific privacy notices or materials to explain our products in more detail.

    </p>
    <h3>Information we collect and how we use it</h3> 
    <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>
            <strong>Information you provide</strong> – When you sign up for a Forum Account, 
            we ask you for personal information. We may combine the information you submit under 
            your account with information from other InteSoft services or third parties in order 
            to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. 
            For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such 
            information.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cookies</strong> – When you visit InteSoft, we send one or more cookies to 
            your computer or other device. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, 
            including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, 
            and tracking user trends, such as how people browse. InteSoft also uses cookies in 
            its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads 
            across the web and on InteSoft services.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Log information</strong> – When you access InteSoft services via a browser, 
            application or other client our servers automatically record certain information. 
            These server logs may include information such as your web request, your interaction 
            with a service, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date 
            and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your 
            browser or your account.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>User communications</strong> – When you send email or other communications 
            to InteSoft, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, 
            respond to your requests and improve our services. When you send and receive SMS 
            messages to or from one of our services that provides SMS functionality, we may 
            collect and maintain information associated with those messages, such as the phone 
            number, the wireless carrier associated with the phone number, the content of the 
            message, and the date and time of the transaction. We may use your email address 
            to communicate with you about our services.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Affiliated InteSoft Services on other sites</strong> – We offer some of our 
            services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to 
            those sites may be sent to InteSoft in order to deliver the service. We process 
            such information under this Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Third Party Applications</strong> – InteSoft may make available third party 
            applications, such as gadgets or extensions, through its services. The information 
            collected by InteSoft when you enable a third party application is processed under 
            this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the third party application provider 
            is governed by their privacy policies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Location data</strong> – InteSoft offers location-enabled services, such as 
            InteSoft Forums. If you use those services, InteSoft may receive information 
            about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information 
            that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Other sites</strong> – This Privacy Policy applies to InteSoft services only. 
            We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that 
            include InteSoft applications, products or services, or links from within our various 
            services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, 
            collect data or solicit personal information from you.
        </li>
    </ul> 
    <p>In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services (including advertising services) and develop new services; and</li>
        <li>Protect the rights or property of InteSoft or our users.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
        If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, 
        then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.
    </p>
    <p>
        InteSoft processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and 
        in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information outside your own country.
    </p>
    <h3>Choices</h3> 
    <p>
        You can use the <a href="/account ">Profile Page</a> to review 
        and control the information stored in your Forum Account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse 
        all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some InteSoft features and 
        services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
        InteSoft uses the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">DoubleClick 
        advertising cookie</a> on AdSense partner sites and certain InteSoft services to help advertisers 
        and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can view and manage your ads preferences 
        associated with this cookie by accessing the 
        <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/?hl=en">Ads Preferences Manager</a>. In addition, 
        you may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using 
        <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/ads/">DoubleClick’s opt-out cookie</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Information sharing</h3> 
    <p>
        InteSoft only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of InteSoft 
        in the following limited circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul> 
        <li>
            We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal 
            information.
        </li>
        <li>
            We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted 
            businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. 
            We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions 
            and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and 
            security measures.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information 
            is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or 
            enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including 
            investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address 
            fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property 
            or safety of InteSoft, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If InteSoft becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of
        its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such 
        transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject 
        to a different privacy policy.
    </p>
    <h3>Information security</h3> 
    <p>
        We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized 
        alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, 
        storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and 
        physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal 
        data.
    </p>
    <p>
        We restrict access to personal information to InteSoft employees, contractors and agents who 
        need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound 
        by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal 
        prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
    </p>
    <h3>Accessing and updating personal information</h3> 
    <p>
        When you use InteSoft services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your 
        personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data 
        at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business 
        purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, 
        corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that 
        are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize 
        the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning 
        information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case 
        where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except 
        if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, 
        after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted 
        from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems. Please review the service Help Centers 
        for more information.
    </p>
    <h3>Enforcement</h3> 
    <p>
        InteSoft adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, 
        Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement.
    </p>
    <p>
        InteSoft regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written 
        complaints, it is InteSoft’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns.
        We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, 
        to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between 
        InteSoft and an individual.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3> 
    <p>
        Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights 
        under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on 
        this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, 
        for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes).
