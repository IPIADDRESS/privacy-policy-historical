<p><b>Browsing our site</b><br> 

Morris 4x4 Center obtains some basic information when you visit jeep 4x4center.com to improve the quality of your experience. The information that we obtain depends upon where you travel within our site. Anytime that you visit our site to browse, read or download information, we obtain and store the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet (for example, msn.com, aol.com, etcâ€¦); the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.

<b>Cookies</b><br> 

Morris 4x4 Center uses "cookies" on our site to enable you to save your Jeep information and to expedite any future orders. A "cookie" is a small text file that a website can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your activities on the site or to make it possible for you to use an online "shopping cart" to keep track of items you wish to purchase. The cookie transmits this information back to the Web site's computer, which, generally speaking, is the only computer that can read it. Most consumers do not know that "cookies" are being placed on their computers when they visit websites. If you want to know when this happens, or to prevent it from happening, you can set your browser to warn you when a website attempts to place a "cookie" on your computer. Our site relies upon the use of cookies to enhance your shopping experience, but our cookies do not contain nor track your personally identifiable information.<br><br> 

<b>E-Mail Newsletter Registration Request</b><br> 

If you choose to provide more information to us through our e-mail registration, we will periodically send you newsletters in which you will find special offers, new product announcements and other related information. Your registration information will enable us to provide you information regarding future products and services that may suit your particular interests.  You may â€œopt-out" of our e-mail newsletter at any time by calling us at 1-877-553-5337.

We do NOT sell, trade or share our e-mail list with any other person or organization.  Note: Our e-mail accounts are hosted by our sister site www.cyberjeep.com.<br>

<b>Product Purchases</b><br> 

If you choose to purchase a product from us, we will collect your personally identifiable information, such as your name, e-mail address, billing postal address, shipping postal address, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date ("Purchase Information") in order to properly process your purchase.
