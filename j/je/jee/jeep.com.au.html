Consequently, CA cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to CA and you do so at your own risk. Once CA receives your transmission, CA makes reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. CA uses secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.

By using this website or providing Personal Information to CA, you agree that CA can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of this website. CA may send an email to you at the email address you have provided to CA if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>
