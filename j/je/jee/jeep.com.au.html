    FCAA offers a variety of services and functions through its Websites and Applications. Personal Information that is collected through a Website or Application may be used and/or disclosed to third parties in order to enable us to provide functionality or services to you. For example, some FCAA Websites and Applications allow you to interface with third party websites or applications.

If you are a contractor, your personnel records, which may contain Sensitive Information may be sent overseas to other FCAG entities and/or FCAG database storage services.

  <p>
    An overseas recipient may also be subject to a foreign law which could compel disclosure of personal information to a third party, for example, an overseas government or regulatory authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you consent to the disclosure in circumstances where we have informed you that we will not take any steps to ensure that the overseas recipient deals with your Personal Information in accordance with the APPs the overseas recipient handles the information in breach of the APPs you will not be able to seek redress under the Privacy Act, may not be able to seek redress in the overseas jurisdiction and we will not be accountable under the Privacy Act.

  <p>
    FCAA takes all reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is kept safe from misuse, interference, loss and unauthorised access, modification and disclosure. The electronic database that holds the information is designed to restrict access to unauthorised persons.
  </p>
  <p>
    No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, FCAA cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to FCAA and you do so at your own risk. Once FCAA receives your transmission, FCAA makes reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. FCAA uses secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. If FCAA learns of a security system's breach, FCAA may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using one of our Websites or Application, you agree that FCAA can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Website or Application. FCAA may send an email to you at the email address you have provided to FCAA if a security breach occurs. If you become aware of any breach of security involving your Personal Information, please contact us immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
    Except to the extent liability cannot be excluded under statute, we exclude all liability (including in negligence) for the consequences of any unauthorised access to, disclosure of, misuse of or loss or corruption of your Personal Information. Nothing in this Privacy Policy restricts, excludes or modifies or purports to restrict, exclude or modify any statutory consumer rights under any applicable law including the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).
  </p>
  <p>
    FCAA takes all reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify Personal Information that is no longer needed for a permitted purpose and it is not required to be retained by law.
  </p>

  <h3>Public areas</h3>
  <p>
    Any information disclosed in public areas of a FCAA Website or Application or other website (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.) will become public information. FCAA cannot control the use of information disclosed in public forums, such as social media forums, platforms, bulletin boards, blogs, wikis, chat rooms, and networking functions of mobile-device applications. You should exercise caution when disclosing information in these public areas, especially your location-data, and be careful how you disclose your Personal Information. Content posted in public areas of FCAA Websites or Applications, including advice and opinions, represent the views and is the responsibility of those who post the content. FCAA does not necessarily endorse, support, verify, or agree with the content posted and reserves the right to remove comments that FCAA considers to be offensive, derogatory or otherwise inappropriate.

  <p>
    FCAG Websites and Applications are not directed at children. If you are under 18 or otherwise would be required to have parent or guardian consent to share information with FCAA, you should not send any information about yourself to FCAA. If a person under 18 submits information through any part of a FCAG Website or Application, and FCAA learns the person submitting the information is a child, FCAA will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible. Because FCAA does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from persons under 18, FCAA does not knowingly use or disclose such information to third parties.
