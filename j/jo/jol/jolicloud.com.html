<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>March 16th 2011</strong></p>

<p>We value your privacy and will take all reasonable steps to safeguard the security of any information you input or send to us by using secure services and encryption technology.</p>

<p>Jolicloud is committed to respecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal data. By using the Jolicloud site, Jolicloud services, you agree to abide and be bound by this Privacy Policy, which may be modified or updated from time to time without notice. In this event the update will be displayed on the Site.</p>

<h2>What information is collected or used?</h2>

<h3>Personal information provided by you</h3>

<p>When you sign up for Jolicloud you provide us with your name and email address. During the registration process we give you the opportunity to provide additional profile information, including (but not limited to) your birthday, gender, country where you live, as well as a picture of yourself. We also provide you with tools including (but not limited to) Facebook Connect to help you retrieve your profile information from third party services you may use. We may from time to time ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. Once you register you can visit your profile at any time to add or remove personal information about yourself.</p>

<h3>Information we collect when you interact with Jolicloud</h3>

<p>We may collect information about your usage of and interaction with the Jolicloud services and Jolicloud sites including computer and connection information, device capability, bandwidth, statistics on page views, and traffic to and from our websites and services.</p>

<p>We may also collect data pertaining to your “Friends” and list you as a “Follower” on their profile or collect and share other information for your activity, including (but not limited to) friends you have connected with, upgrades you have made and applications you have installed, removed, created and accessed. We do not collect data relating to your use of third party applications. We offer search tools to help you find and connect with your friends already on Jolicloud, as well as tools to invite your friends who do not have Jolicloud accounts to join. In addition we provide contact importer tools such as Facebook Connect to help connect with your friends who are members of both Facebook &amp; Jolicloud.</p>

<h3>Information that gets shared publicly</h3>
 
<p>When you “star” an application it will appear in your stream and be visible for all your “Followers” inside Jolicloud. In addition it will appear on your “Public Page” which can be accessed by everyone on the Internet, be indexed by third party search engines, and be imported, exported, distributed, and redistributed by us and others without privacy limitations.  The default privacy setting is to share your “starred” applications on your “Public Page”. You can deactivate the sharing of this information.</p>

<h3>Information we receive from third parties</h3>

<p>We do not own or operate the applications that you use through the Jolicloud application directory or the websites that you interact with through Jolicloud. Whenever you install one of these applications or use one of these website, we may receive information from them, including information about actions you take. In some cases, in order to personalize the process of connecting, we may receive a limited amount of information even before you authorize the application or website.</p>

<p>Some applications may be co-branded and offered together with or via a partner company. If you register for or use such applications, you consent to both Jolicloud and the partner company’s use of personal data collected in connection with the co-branded product.</p>

<p>Jolicloud uses <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> to help understand use of our Services. The type of information collected includes (but is not limited to) cookies and your IP address. Google also receives this information and their use of it is governed by their <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>What we use your information for</h2>

<p>The reason we collect information is to provide you with a reliable, safe, efficient and personalized experience. Jolicloud collects and uses, or has third party service providers acting on Jolicloud’s behalf collecting and using, personal data relating to you, as permitted or necessary to (i) deliver services for you (as described when we collect the information), (ii) provide you with help &amp; support, (iii) let you know about service status, updates and faults, (iv) compare information for accuracy, (v) get your feedback on our services and on how we are doing, (vi) resolve disputes, (vii) verify your identity, (viii) evolve, enhance and measure the Jolicloud distribution &amp; related services and websites; and (ix) set up and undertake Jolicloud's marketing or promotional activities and events.</p>

<p><u>We do not sell your personal data.</u></p>

<p>We do not disclose your private information except in the limited following situations : (i) when we have your consent to do so, such as when you use a third party service to connect to your Jolicloud account, (ii) when we work with trusted third parties partners who carry out specific functions and services for us, we may share your personal information with them. However this is only done to the extent necessary for them to perform the functions and services we require of them, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy and (iii) when required to do so by a law regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to tackle fraud, security or technical issues; or to perserve Jolicloud's rights or property.</p>

<h2>Information security</h2>

<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>

<h2>Transfer of your Information outside the EEA</h2>

<p>Your Information may be collected, stored, accessed and further processed (by us or data processors acting on our behalf) in the United States and other territories both inside and outside the EEA. If we process your Information on servers or using service providers based in such territories, we will ensure that your Information is afforded the same level of protection as in the EEA.</p>

<h2>Enforcement (right of access and modification)</h2>

<p>According to the French data protection law dated 6th January 1978, you have a right to access and modify your personal data stored by Jolicloud. Accordingly, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. To access and modify your personal data, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@jolicloud.com">privacy@jolicloud.com</a> and follow these instructions. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>The Privacy policy is governed by French law. The privacy policy may be modified or updated from time to time without prior notice to you. The most current version will always be at <a href="http://www.jolicloud.com/privacy">http://www.jolicloud.com/privacy</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us any time at <a href="mailto:privacy@jolicloud.com">privacy@jolicloud.com</a>.</p>
