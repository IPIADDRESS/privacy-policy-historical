<p>
    I recognize that privacy of your personal information is
    important.  Here is information on what types of personal
    information I receive and collect when you use visit
    johnbokma.com, and how I safeguard your information.
</p>
<p>
    Information I collect through log files or comments posted
    on this site will never be sold to third parties.
</p>
<h2>Log Files</h2>
<p class="first">
    As with most other websites, I collect and use the data
    contained in log files. The information in the log files
    include your IP address, the browser you used to visit our
    site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you
    visited our site and which pages you visited throughout my
    web site.
</p>
<h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
<p class="first">
    Currently I use third party advertisements (Google AdSense) on
    johnbokma.com to support my site. Some of these
    advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web
    beacons when they advertise on my site, which will also
    send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google
    AdSense program) information including your IP address,
    the browser you used to visit my site, and in some cases,
    whether you have Flash installed.  This is generally used
    for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate
    ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing
    certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as
    showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking
    sites).
</p>
<h3>Google and the DoubleClick DART cookie</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
		Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve
		ads on my site.
	    </li>
    <li>
		Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve
		ads to my users based on their visit to this site
		and other sites on the Internet.
	    </li>
    <li>
		You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by
		visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" rel="nofollow">Google
		ad and content network privacy policy</a>.
	    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Disabling Cookies</h2>
<p class="first">
    You can chose to disable or selectively turn off
    third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by
    managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet
    Security.  However, this can affect how you are able to
    interact with other websites.  This could include the
    inability to login to services or programs, such as
    logging into forums or accounts.
