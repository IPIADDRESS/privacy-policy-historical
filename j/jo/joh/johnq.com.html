		<h1>Information we collect and how we use it:</h1>
		
		<p>We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as searching for 
		content on JohnQ.com. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
		
		<p><strong>Information you provide</strong> - When you sign up for a <a href="/privacyfaq.htm#accountinfo">JohnQ Account</a> or 
		other JohnQ service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). 
		For certain services, such as our paid and subscription programs, we also request credit card or other payment account information which are maintained in 
		encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other JohnQ services or third parties 
		in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt 
		out of combining such information.</p>
		
		<p><strong>JohnQ cookies</strong> - When you visit JohnQ, we send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - 
		to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user 
		trends, such as what people watch on our site(s). Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies 
		or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some JohnQ features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Log information</strong> - When you use JohnQ services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends 
		whenever you visit a website. These <a href="/privacyfaq.htm#serverlogs">server logs</a> may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol 
		address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more <a href="/privacyfaq.htm#cookies">cookies</a> that may uniquely 
		identify your browser.</p>
		
		<p><strong>User communications</strong> - When you send email or other communication to JohnQ, we may retain those communications in order 
		to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Affiliated sites</strong> - We offer some of our services in connection with other web sites. Personal information that you 
		provide to those sites may be sent to JohnQ in order to deliver the service. We process such information in accordance with this Policy. The affiliated sites 
		may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Links</strong> - JohnQ may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. 
		We use this information to improve the quality of our content merchandizing, customized content and advertising. For more information about links and redirected 
		URLs, please see our <a href="/privacyfaq.htm#urls">FAQs</a>.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Other sites</strong> - This Privacy Policy applies to web sites and services that are owned and operated by John Q Media, 
		LLC. We do not exercise control over many of the sites displayed as links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or 
		other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.</p>
		
		<p>JohnQ only processes personal information for the purposes described in the applicable Privacy Policy and/or privacy notice for specific services. In addition 
		to the above, such purposes include:</p>
		
		<p>Providing our products and services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising; </p>
		
		<p>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;</p>
		
		<p>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and</p>
		
		<p>Developing new services.</p>
		
		<p>You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the privacy notices for particular services.</p>
		
		<p>JohnQ processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information 
		on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information 
		on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners.</p>
		
		<h1>Choices for personal information </h1>
		
		<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner 
		different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>
		
		<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer 
		you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or 
		use <a href="/privacyfaq.htm#sensitiveinfo">sensitive information</a> for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service 
		notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.</p>
		
		<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case JohnQ may not be able to provide those services to you.</p>
		
		<h1>Information sharing </h1>
		
		<p>JohnQ only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of JohnQ in the following limited circumstances:</p>
		
		<p>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</p>
		
		<p>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal 
		information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and 
		any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
		
		<p>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, 
		legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable <a href="/terms.htm">Terms of Service</a>, including investigation of potential 
		violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, 
		property or safety of JohnQ, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
		
		<p>If JohnQ becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information 
		is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
		
		<p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of <a href="/privacyfaq.html#aggregatedinfo">aggregated, non-personal information</a>, such as the number of 
		users who watched a particular content item, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.</p>
		
		<p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.</p>
		
		<h1>Information security </h1>
		
		<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. 
		These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to 
		guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
		
		<p>We restrict access to personal information to JohnQ employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or 
		improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal 
		prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
		
		<h1>Data integrity </h1>
		
		<p>JohnQ processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific 
		privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information 
		needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, 
		but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>
		
		<h1>Accessing and updating personal information </h1>
		
		<p>When you use JohnQ services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is 
		inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual 
		users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process 
		requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely 
		impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we 
		provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our 
		services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific 
		privacy notices or FAQs for these services.</p>
		
		<h1>Enforcement </h1>
		
		<p>JohnQ regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or JohnQ's treatment of 
		personal information by <a href="http://server.iad.liveperson.net/hc/s-19981037/web/ticketpub/msgcontroller.jsp" onclick="javascript:window.open('http://server.iad.liveperson.net/hc/s-19981037/web/ticketpub/msgcontroller.jsp','email','width=600,height=600,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes');return false;">contacting 
		us</a> through this web site or by writing to us at Privacy Matters, c/o John Q Media, LLC, 272 Water Street, Suite 3R, NY, NY 10038 USA. When we receive 
		formal written complaints at this address, it is JohnQ's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the 
		appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that 
		cannot be resolved between JohnQ and an individual. </p>
		
		<h1>Changes to this policy</h1> 
		
		<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, 
		and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will 
		provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified 
		at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep <a href="/privacy.htm">prior versions of this Privacy Policy</a> in an archive for your review.</p>
