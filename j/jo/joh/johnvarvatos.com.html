<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6;">In addition, you may provide certain Personal Information about third-parties on or through the Web Site. For example, you must provide us with Personal Information about a third-party when you request that we ship an order to a third-party or request that we send your information to a third-party.

<section>
<h2><strong><span style="font-size:14px;">Use of Cookies/Web Beacons:</span></strong></h2>

<p>Like many other web sites, we may collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage by using cookies, web beacons (also called pixel tags, Internet tags and clear GIFs) and related tracking technologies. A “cookie” is a small text file that a web site sends through the browser to a user's hard drive for data storage. The information collected by cookies and related technology may include technical information about your computer (including your computer’s Internet protocol address, your operating system, your browser type and date and time of your visit), and the pages you view, the features you use, the searches you conduct and queries you make, the links you click, the purchases you make and the third-party sites you have visited or visit later.&nbsp; We use the information gathered from cookies, web beacons and related technologies to analyze and understand how the Web Site is used, to enhance your visits to the Web Site, for web analytics, behavioral tracking and to create and deliver use-tailored advertising to provide you with information on products, services or offers that may be of interest to you. &nbsp;For example, we may use cookies and related technologies to: (i) customize account pages for you, (ii) track user visits and account features, (iii) determine what features and pages are most frequently requested or visited, (iv) save your password so you do not have to provide it each time you visit the Web Site, and (v) for Internet-Based Advertising (as described below). Most browsers accept cookies automatically, however, can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on our computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. By disabling or otherwise rejecting cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings on this Web Site. We recommend that you leave cookies “turned on” so that we can offer you a better shopping experience on this Web Site.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6;">We may use third-party service providers and outside companies to provide Internet data hosting and to help us measure and determine how visitors use our Web Site and the effectiveness of our Web Site and promotion in order to help us improve and optimize our Web Site and the products and services we offer.&nbsp; We may also use third-parties, including but not limited to certain advertising intermediaries, to collect your Personal Information and information regarding your online behavior for the purpose of behavioral tracking and Internet-Based Advertising (as described below) to provide you with use-tailored advertisements.&nbsp; Such advertising intermediaries may include advertising networks, advertising exchanges, analytics providers, data brokers, re-targeters and/or market researchers.&nbsp; Those third-parties may place web beacons or pixel tags on certain pages of our Web Site or use cookies in order to facilitate collection of your Personal Information and information regarding your use of the Web Site each time you visit the Web Site.&nbsp; Third-parties collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different web sites as a result of accessing this Web Site.&nbsp; Any such third-party’s data collection and data handling practices are defined by the third-party and not by John Varvatos.&nbsp; We make no representations or warranties about any third-party web sites.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6;">In addition, some of our e-mail communications to you may include a “click-through URL” linked to a particular page on the Web Site. By clicking on one of the URLs, you will automatically enter our Web Site and we may collect information related to the “click-through”. You may avoid having this information collected by not clicking on URL links in our e-mail communications.</span></p>

<section>
<h2><span style="font-size:14px;">Interest-Based Advertising:</span></h2>

<p>We and/or our third-party service providers (as described above) may use cookies, web beacons or related technology to collect information about you and your online browsing behavior for the purposes of Interest-Based Advertising.&nbsp; For example, we and/or such third-party service providers may receive information through your browser when you access the Web Site and/or click on a John Varvatos advertisement or banner displayed on a third-party web site.&nbsp; Such information may include technical information about your computer (including your computer’s Internet protocol address, your operating system, your browser type and date and time of your visit), the pages you view, the features you use, the searches you conduct and queries you make, the links you click, the purchases you make, the URL of pages you link to from the Web Site, the URL of pages you come from when accessing the Web Site, third-party web sites you have visited or visit later and the advertisements or banners you click on in order to access the Web Site.&nbsp; We and/or our third-party service providers may store, analyze and utilize such information for the purpose of predicting which John Varvatos products, advertisements and banners may be of most interest to you in the future and providing you with use-tailored advertisements regarding products, services or offers that may be of interest to you.</p>

<h2>How is Information Used and Disclosed?</h2>

<h3><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>Personal Information:</strong></span></h3>

<p>Personal Information collected on or through this Web Site is used to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations and to provide customer service. If you sign up to our e-mail list or otherwise opt-in to receive promotional communications in connection with this Web Site, we may also use the Personal Information you provide to contact you about sales, special offers and new site features and to send you other promotional communications. You may manage your preferences as described below.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6;">If you request us to ship products to a third-party and we are able to determine the information you provided pertains to a third-party, we will use the Personal Information you provide regarding that third-party only to process and ship the product to that third-party and to confirm shipment. In addition, we may retain that Personal Information as reasonably necessary to appropriately document our business activities and for archival and record retention purposes.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:14px;">Aggregate and Automatically collected Information:</span></strong></h3>

<p>Automatically collected information is used to analyze and improve this Web Site, gauge the effectiveness of our email communications and your level of interest in particular areas and to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.</p>

<p>We may on occasion combine information we received through this Web Site with information obtained from other sources and outside records to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.</p>

<p>We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Web Site and e-mails to third-parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user. Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about you, such as age, gender, types of products purchased, pages you access most frequently or search terms you enter. Aggregate information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. For example, the number of people who visit our Web Site who are 25 years of age is aggregate information that does not personally identify a specific user.</p>

<h3><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>Interest-Based Advertising:</strong></span></h3>

<p>Information we collect and store from your browser by use of cookies or related technology may be used for the purpose of predicting which John Varvatos products, advertisements and banners may be of most interest to you in the future and showing you such products, advertisements and banners on this Web Site and/or on third-party sites.</p>

<p>We may disclose user information to government authorities, and to other third-parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required by law in our good faith belief, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas and as otherwise required in connection with a judicial or government proceeding or legal process. We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of the Web Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities or to verify or enforce compliance with the terms of use and policies that govern our Web Site or as otherwise required or permitted by law or where we believe it is necessary to investigate or address unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of a consumer or the general public.
