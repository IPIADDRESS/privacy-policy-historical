<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p class="p1"><strong></strong>At JFS Inc. (“JFS”, “we”, “us”, “our”), your privacy is of great importance to us. &nbsp;We have provided this Privacy Policy to describe our online data practices so you can better understand how we collect and use information you provide to us through www.joefresh.com (the “Web Site”).</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong></strong>You may provide us with information about you when you register at our Web Site, request information, purchase products from us, or otherwise actively interact with the Web Site. &nbsp;By providing us with this information, you consent to our collection of the data. &nbsp;For purposes of this Privacy Policy, personal information may include such information as your name, mailing address, email address, billing information, and phone number. &nbsp;The type of personal information that is provided by you also depends on the nature of the transaction. &nbsp;Here are some examples of where you may provide us information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you sign up for an account through the Web Site;</li>
<li>When you enter a prize promotion or contest offered through this Web Site;</li>
<li>When you share with your friends content you have created through the Web Site; or</li>
<li>When you request information, products or services from us or join our mailing lists.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Personal information provided by you through the Web Site will be used, with your consent if required, for purposes consistent with those purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, or for the purpose(s) authorized when it was submitted. &nbsp;We use information about you for various purposes, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>To verify your identity and protect each party from error and fraud;</li>
<li>To respond to your inquiries;</li>
<li>To verify your eligibility for, and to provide you with, products and services;</li>
<li>To help us serve you better, and to provide you with information about other products and services which we believe may be of interest to you;</li>
<li>To better understand your shopping interests and purchase history so we can provide you offers and promotions that we believe may of interest to you;</li>
<li>To manage and develop our business and operations;</li>
<li>To manage and administer contests, promotions, or sweepstakes;</li>
<li>To generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal use;</li>
<li>To meet legal and regulatory requirements; and</li>
<li>To fulfill any other purpose consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SERVICE PROVIDERS &amp; THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We may share information about you with carefully selected third-party service providers who may assist us in responding to your inquires or requests or otherwise serve you, fulfill your requests for products, or for the purpose(s) authorized when it was submitted.&nbsp; For example, if you voluntarily submit personal information to enter a sweepstakes on the Web Site, the information that you submit may be used as part of your entry to that sweepstakes. &nbsp;These third parties are required to treat this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may also share information about you with carefully selected third parties so that they may provide you relevant advertising on this Site and elsewhere on the Internet or to offer you their products or services. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN CONTROL DATA ABOUT YOU</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>You may choose at any time to remove any of your personal information from any lists we might use to send you marketing communications by contacting us using the contact information provided below. &nbsp;You may also elect to remove your information from lists we may share with third parties for their own marketing purposes by contacting us through the means described in the Contact Us section. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>E-Mail</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">You can subscribe to receive coupons, promotions, and other product offers (“Promotion Emails”) from us by email by visiting joefresh.com and clicking on ‘subscribe’ within the bottom navigation. If you no longer wish to receive emails from us, you can unsubscribe through a link provided in a Promotion Email from us or contacting us through the means described in the Contact Us section. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">You may still receive emails from us if you elect to unsubscribe, but you will no longer receive Promotion Emails. &nbsp;For example, if you provide your email in order to participate in an optional feature or function of the Website such as a sweepstakes, contest or online offer, even if you opt to unsubscribe from Promotion Emails or change your preferences not to receive any marketing communications, you may still receive emails about the specific sweepstakes, contest or online offer you entered until the sweepstakes, contest or online offer has expired, but you will not receive other emails if you opt to “Unsubscribe”.</p>
<p class="p1">If you elect to share content with your friends through tools or features provided through the Web site, you may be required to provide your friends’ email addresses. &nbsp;We will only use this information to send your message and will not retain the information for our own use. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong></strong>When you visit the Web Site, you do not have to provide us with any personal information. &nbsp;However, certain non-identifying information may be automatically collected. &nbsp;We do not consider this information to be personal information. &nbsp;For example, our web server may collect the internet protocol (“IP”) address and the name of the Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) associated with the computer from which you accessed the Web Site, the type and version of web browser and operating system that you are using, and the address of the web site that you visited prior to visiting the Web Site. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">We use this information to better understand how visitors interact with the Web Site so that we can improve your experience when you visit this site. We may use this information to better design our Website and enhance your shopping experience. &nbsp;For example, we may track your location in order to provide you with location-specific offers and promotions.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong></strong>We may use cookies or other similar technology to enhance your online experience. &nbsp;A “cookie” is a small piece of information that our web server automatically sends to your browser that permits our web server to recall information about your settings and preferences (such as the settings of your web browser and language preference). &nbsp;Please note that portions of the Web Site may not function if you do not accept cookies.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>SECURITY &amp; RETENTION</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong></strong>We use security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the information to help protect personal information against loss or theft and against unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</p>
<p class="p1">Personal information will be retained only as long as necessary to fulfill a legitimate business need or as required by law. &nbsp;All destruction or removal of personal information from our records is done securely with due regard to the sensitivity of the information concerned.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>OPENNESS</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong></strong>We make information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information available to you, including by posting the current version of this Privacy Policy on the Web Site.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>INDIVIDUAL ACCESS</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong></strong>We want to ensure that we keep only the most accurate and up-to-date information about you in our records. &nbsp;Accordingly, whenever you believe that information you have given to us needs to be updated or corrected, you can contact us using the contact information provided below to correct or update your contact information.</p>
<p class="p1">Upon receipt by us of your written request, you will be informed, within a reasonable time following such request, of the existence, use and disclosure of your personal information collected through the Web Site and will be given access to that information. &nbsp;We may need to verify your identity before providing you with the personal information we hold about you. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">We may not be able to provide you with access to your personal information where the information cannot be disclosed for reasons of security or commercial confidentiality, where the information is protected by legal privilege or when access is prohibited by law. &nbsp;If we cannot provide access, we will inform you of the reasons why access has been denied, except when we are prohibited from doing so by law.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong></strong>The Web Site is for a general audience and is not intended for use by or targeted to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally information from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>A NOTE ABOUT PRIZE PROMOTIONS</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong></strong>Promotions (such as contests, sweepstakes or giveaways) that are hosted on the Web Site may be sponsored by JFS, may be co-sponsored by JFS and another company, or may be sponsored by companies other than JFS. &nbsp;JFS may also sponsor or co-sponsor promotions hosted by third parties on linked third party web sites. When you enter a promotion hosted or sponsored by JFS and/or our partners, you may be asked to provide registration information, which may include your name, address, and email address, and other information, some of which may be optional, in order to participate. If you voluntarily submit personally identifying information to enter a sweepstakes on the Website, the information that your submit may be used as part of your entry, for sweepstakes administration and prize fulfillment purposes, and/or for future marketing by Sponsor, such as to notify you of a product or promotion that Sponsor thinks may be of interest. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Third parties that host promotions alone or in conjunction with JFS may collect and use your information. Some promotion sites may use Cookies in order to track your progress or number of entries in a promotion. If information is collected and used by a third party in conjunction with a promotion, please review the third party’s Privacy Policy to learn about its information practices.</p>
<p class="p1">When you participate in a promotion, you are subject to the Official Rules of that promotion, which may contain additional information about the specific privacy practices associated with that promotion.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>THIRD-PARTY LINKS</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong></strong>For your convenience, the Web Site may contain links to other web sites operated by third parties. &nbsp;Any such web sites are wholly independent from our Web Site and we have no control over those web sites and their operators, including their privacy policies and practices. &nbsp;Before providing any of your personal information on any such other web site, you should review their policies on privacy and security.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>UPDATES</strong></p>
