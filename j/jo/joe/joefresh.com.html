<p><a style="color:#999" href="/terms"><span style="font-size: large;">TERMS OF USE</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>At Loblaw Companies Limited, we respect your privacy and take great  care in protecting your Personal Information. This policy demonstrates  our commitment to your privacy. Read on to discover how your Personal  Information is being protected.</p>
<h3>A. Scope &amp; Interpretation</h3>
<p>This policy applies to Loblaw Companies Limited and its subsidiaries  in Canada (collectively referred to in this document as “Loblaw”, “we”,  “us” or “our”). Subsidiaries of Loblaw means Loblaws Inc., President’s  Choice Services Inc., President’s Choice Bank, PC Financial Insurance  Broker Inc., PC Financial Insurance Agency Inc. and other subsidiaries  of Loblaw. Subsidiaries of Loblaw does not include T&amp;T Supermarket  Inc.</p>
<p>In this policy, we explain what Personal Information we collect, and how we use, share and manage it.</p>
<p>Please note that when you sign up for, participate in or purchase a  specific product, service, program, contest, promotion or event  available through Loblaw, additional terms and conditions may be  provided regarding the collection, use or sharing of Personal  Information in connection with that product, service, program, contest,  promotion or event. Those terms and conditions will apply together with  this policy.</p>
<p><b>Personal Information</b></p>
<p>“Personal Information” as used in this policy means information about  an identifiable individual, such as the name and date of birth of that  individual, and includes non-personal information that we link to  Personal Information.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to the collection, use and disclosure of  Personal Information by our franchisees, or companies with which we have  business relationships. However, if we receive from such entities  Personal Information or non-personal information that we link to  Personal Information, then this privacy policy will apply to our  collection, use and sharing of that information.</p>
<p><b>What Personal Information is not</b></p>
<p>This policy does not cover non-personal information, which is  information that does not identify you. However, as stated above, when  we collect non-personal information and link that non-personal  information to an identifiable individual, then that information will  become Personal Information and become subject to this policy.</p>
<h3>B. Consent</h3>
<p>Unless permitted or required by law, Loblaw will not collect, use or  share Personal Information without first obtaining consent. We will  obtain consent when we want to use Personal Information for a new  purpose or for a purpose other than those stated at the time of  collection, in this policy or in the terms and conditions of a specific  product, service, program, contest, promotion or event you signed up  for, participated in or purchased.</p>
<p>Consent can be “express” through words or by specific acts or  “implied” by the conduct of the individual whose Personal Information is  being collected, used or shared. Unless we determine that we require an  additional consent for specific products, services, programs, contests,  promotions or events, you agree and consent that as a customer of  Loblaw we may collect, use, share or otherwise process your Personal  Information in accordance with this policy.</p>
<p>You may withdraw your consent for certain purposes. For example, you may choose not to receive:</p>
<ul>
    <li>information addressed to you personally about products, services,  programs, contests, promotions or events offered by Loblaw or companies  with whom we have business relationships; or</li>
    <li>invitations addressed to you personally to comment on the products,  services, programs, contests, promotions or events that you use or that  are available to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a President’s Choice Financial<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;or PC  Financial&nbsp;(each referred to as “PC Financial” in this policy) product,  such as a credit card account, you may withdraw consent to the sharing  of Personal Information or non-personal information about your PC  Financial account, such as your account or card number information, with  any merchants with whom you have set up pre-authorized payments from  your account.</p>
<p>However, because of legal or regulatory requirements that we have or  contractual obligations you have with us, there are limited  circumstances where you may not withdraw your consent to the collection,  use or sharing of your Personal Information. For example, to obtain  credit products, you are required to provide consent on your application  to the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information to  allow us to obtain and to update credit reports and other credit history  information about you from time to time with credit bureau agencies and  other entities that support the credit reporting system. Your consent  for these purposes cannot be withdrawn during the time you have credit  with us and for a reasonable period of time afterwards.</p>
<p>If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information or  if you withdraw your consent, where such withdrawal is available, we may  not be able to offer you the products, services, programs, contests,  promotions, events or information that you requested or that could be  offered to you. For example, if you withdraw your consent to the sharing  by our pharmacy of your Personal Information with your provincial drug  benefit program or your private health insurance provider, we may be  unable to transmit drug benefit claims, which means you will have to pay  for your prescription and seek reimbursement yourself afterwards.  Similarly, if our pharmacists are unable to consult with others who  provide you with care, they may, using their professional judgment,  decline to fill a prescription. Please also be aware that, even if you  have withdrawn your consent to receive marketing communications from us,  we may continue to contact you for certain non-marketing purposes  necessary for the management of our businesses, as required by law or  related to products, services, programs, contests, promotions or events  that you had signed up for, agreed to participate in or purchased.</p>
<p>To withdraw or limit your consent, you can contact us as described  below in “Answering Your Privacy Questions”. If you have a product,  service or program, such as an insurance policy, or are participating in  a contest, promotion or event, that is offered by a third party  together with Loblaw or under a Loblaw brand, you may also have to  provide your consent preferences or withdraw your consent with that  third party separately.</p>
<p>Please note that it may take some time for all of our records to  reflect changes in your preferences. For example, if you request that  you not receive personalized marketing communications from Loblaw, your  preference may not be captured for a promotion already in progress.</p>
<h3>C. How We Collect Personal Information</h3>
<p>Loblaw collects Personal Information in a variety of ways such as  during the course of your purchase of, or application or request for a  quote for, our products and services or your participation in one or  more of our programs, contests, promotions or events. Loblaw limits the  collection of Personal Information to what is reasonably required.</p>
<p>Loblaw collects Personal Information in the following ways:</p>
<p><b>Directly From you.</b>&nbsp;You may provide Personal Information to us  in person, by mail, over the telephone, through our websites or in any  other direct manner. For example, Personal Information may be collected  through our monitoring and recording of communications, such as  telephone calls to our call centres.</p>
<p><b>From Third Parties.</b>&nbsp;We may receive Personal Information from  other sources. For instance, with respect to PC Financial products,  services or programs, these sources may include credit reporting  agencies or other financial institutions.</p>
<p><b>Through Technology.</b>&nbsp;We may collect Personal Information and  non-personal information through various technologies directly from you  or from third parties.</p>
<p><u>Point-of-Sale</u>: We may receive non-personal information from  sources such as our own and third party point-of-sale-systems and when  we link that non-personal information to an identifiable individual it  will become Personal Information.</p>
<p><u>Video surveillance</u>: We may collect Personal Information  through video surveillance in areas surrounding our stores, kiosks,  pavilions, bank machines, parking lots and other locations for security  purposes, to protect against theft, damage to property and fraud, and  may use this information to help us better understand the flow of  traffic in our stores.</p>
<p><u>Websites, Social Media, Applications and other electronic means</u>:  We may collect Personal Information and non-personal information  electronically, directly from you or through third parties. For  instance, we may access Personal Information about you when you share  information about yourself on social media networks and also when you  interact with us electronically such as through our information  technology systems, websites, email, mobile applications, social media  properties or online advertising. For example, when you visit one of our  social media sites, we may collect Personal Information that you choose  to submit to us such as your name, contact information, opinions or any  other information you choose to provide for the purposes of responding  to an enquiry you have made, or for any other purpose disclosed to you  at the time of the collection. Third parties may provide information  about you to us, such as search terms you used, or refer you to us as a  result of a search you conducted.</p>
<p>When you interact with us, such as when you visit our websites or  click on our ads, we may use, and send to your device or computer,  cookies, web beacons, single-pixel gifs and other technologies to help  us collect and store Personal Information or non-personal information  about you or to enable us to present offers to you, including  interest-based ads. These technologies are used to help us understand  what actions you take on our own and on third parties’ websites and  applications. For instance, we may store Personal Information and  non-personal information, such as your name, email address, province and  language preference, on one of these technologies to enable us to  populate entry fields that you have previously completed, or present you  with content specific to your region and language preference. We may  also record user and usage data, such as where users click on a page,  the internet protocol (“IP”) address, operating system, which website or  ad the user clicked on to reach our website and which search terms were  used, to help us optimize our websites, generate reports, display  interest based advertisements, or understand which key words result in  visits to our websites. You may delete or disable certain of these  technologies, such as cookies, at any time via your browser. However, if  you do so, you may not be able to use some of the features of our  websites.</p>
<p>If you choose to download or use a mobile or location based  application (“app”) created by or for Loblaw, we may receive Personal  Information and non-personal information about your current location and  about your mobile device, tablet, or browser, such as a unique  identifier for your device. Most devices, tablets and browsers allow you  to turn off the tracking of your location. However, if you do so, you  may not be able to use some or all of our apps.</p>

    <li>Using information (which is non-personal information to the extent  possible) from these marketing, research and statistical analyses to  improve or to develop new products, services, programs, promotions,  contests or events, to better understand you and communicate with you as  set out above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that sensitive Personal Information, which includes  health related information such as a prescription or a medical  condition, and certain financial information, such as account balances,  are not shared among Loblaw and its subsidiaries for this purpose.</p>
<h3>E. How We Share Personal Information</h3>
<p>We are a group of related companies that are governed by this policy.  Where permitted by law, we share Personal Information within our group  of companies for the purposes described in this policy. Please note,  however, that sensitive Personal Information, such as health or  financial information, is only shared within our group of companies on a  limited basis, such as to process a prescription related claim or a  credit card transaction, and not for marketing purposes. For instance,  health information would not be shared between a Loblaw pharmacist and  the provider of health-related insurance such as through PC Financial  travel medical insurance.</p>
<p>We may also share Personal Information about you with other  organizations outside of Loblaw that help Loblaw provide products,  services, programs, promotions, contests or events or help us with our  business operations. These other organizations may include  sub-contractors, third party service providers, third parties that offer  products, services, programs, promotions, contests or events under one  of our brands, or organizations that help us improve our products,  services, programs, promotions, contests or events as well as our  business and technology systems, procedures and infrastructure. When  Loblaw shares Personal Information with any such party, we limit the use  of such Personal Information to those purposes requested by us and we  require that the party has appropriate safeguards for the protection of  that Personal Information.</p>
<p>If you have a product, service or program that involves another  person (e.g. a bank account that is jointly owned, or where you have a  guarantor for a loan or if you add household members to your loyalty or  financial account), we may share certain of your Personal Information  with that person in connection with that product, service or program. In  addition, if you apply for a PC Financial product, service or program,  we may share your Personal Information with the financial institutions,  insurance service providers, underwriters or other financial  intermediaries that we work with to offer the product, service or  program.</p>
<p><b>Healthcare.</b>&nbsp;When we provide you with healthcare services, we  may share your Personal Information with your healthcare providers  (which may also be referred to as your “circle of care”) or, with your  consent, in a manner consistent with this policy. We may also share  Personal Information as permitted or required by law. For example, if  you fill a prescription order in one of our pharmacies, we may share  Personal Information with your provincial drug benefit program, private  health insurance provider, or other health claim adjudicator as  necessary in order to process your claim. We also, as required by law,  provide prescription-related information to regulatory authorities,  government bodies and/or registries.</p>
<p><b>Other sharing.</b>&nbsp;Canadian law permits or requires the use or  sharing of Personal Information without consent in specific  circumstances. These circumstances include situations when required by  law or necessary to protect Loblaw, our employees, our customers, or  others. Should this occur, Loblaw will not share more Personal  Information than is required to fulfill that particular purpose.</p>
<p><b>Sale or transfer of business.</b>&nbsp;From time to time, Loblaw may  decide to sell or transfer all or part of its business to a related  company or to a third party, to merge with another entity, to insure or  securitize its assets, or to engage in another form of corporate or  financing transaction. In addition, the manner in which products,  services, programs, contests, promotions and events are provided to you,  and the organization providing those products, services, programs,  contests, promotions or events, may also change. If your Personal  Information is required in connection with any such transactions, we  will require that the parties involved, including affiliates, advisors  or other service providers, agree to protect your Personal Information  with policies meeting standards equivalent to those set out in this  policy both during and after completion of the transaction.</p>
<p>Similarly, the relationship between Loblaw and a third party that  provides a product, service, program, contest, promotion or event under a  Loblaw brand may cease. If that third party continues to provide a  product, service, program, contest, promotion or event to you, your  Personal Information will be subject to that third party’s privacy  policy.</p>
<p>Other than as stated in this policy or as stated in terms and  conditions or as part of a consent in relation to a product, service,  program, contest, promotion or event, Loblaw does not sell, trade or  share for financial or other benefit any Personal Information with third  parties.</p>
<h3>F. Retention</h3>
<p><b>How We Protect Personal Information</b></p>
<p>Loblaw strives to maintain appropriate physical, procedural and  technical safeguards with respect to its stores, pavilions, kiosks,  offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent loss,  misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of Personal  Information in Loblaw’s custody. Our safeguards also apply to our  disposal or destruction of Personal Information.</p>
<p>We also seek to ensure that any Personal Information in our custody  is as accurate, current and complete as necessary for the purposes for  which we use that Personal Information.</p>
<p><b>Where We Keep Personal Information</b></p>
<p>We store, access and use Personal Information in Canada. Unless there  is a legal or regulatory requirement to keep such information in  Canada, Personal Information may also be stored, accessed, or used  outside of Canada. For instance, when we engage a service provider  outside of Canada, Personal Information may be stored, accessed or used  in any country where the service provider is located, or from which it  provides services, including the United States, India, and the  Philippines. Where Personal Information is located outside of Canada, it  is subject to the laws of that jurisdiction.</p>
<p><b>How Long We Keep Personal Information</b></p>
<p>We actively retain Personal Information only as long as it is  required for our relationship and a certain period of time afterwards to  respond to queries or as required by federal and provincial laws. When  this period ends, Personal Information is scheduled for destruction  according to our record retention policies. Depending on the nature of  the Personal Information and the purpose for which it was collected,  this schedule may vary.</p>
<h3>G. Access And Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>Depending on the product, service or program you receive, you may be  able to access and verify most of the Personal Information we hold about  you by reviewing your account statements or accessing your account  online, or calling the applicable customer service telephone number for  the program, product or service about which you are enquiring.</p>
<p>For Personal Information not available online or via telephone,  Loblaw provides a right of access and review in accordance with  applicable laws, and will endeavour to provide the Personal Information  in question within a reasonable time. You will be asked for  identification so that we may verify your identity before providing you  with your Personal Information. If you require the documents in an  alternative format, we will make reasonable efforts to provide you with  your Personal Information in that format. If there will be charges for  us to retrieve or provide you with specific information that you have  requested, we will advise you of the charges that you would be  responsible for and obtain your authorization before proceeding.</p>
<p>Our policy is to respond to access requests as required by applicable  laws. Loblawmay decline access to Personal Information in certain  circumstances. These include where the information requested would  reveal confidential information or Personal Information about someone  else, or if legal or regulatory requirements prohibit providing access  or permit not providing access to such information.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about how we treat your Personal Information,  please contact the appropriate Privacy Office using the contact  information set out below in “Answering Your Privacy Questions”.</p>
<p>If the Privacy Office is unable to address your concern to your  satisfaction, arbitration may be an option recommended to you to settle  the dispute. Arbitration is a form of dispute resolution. If the parties  decide to pursue arbitration, then the parties would refer the dispute  to an arbitrator who would take into account the evidence of each of the  parties and render a decision.</p>
<p>If you remain unsatisfied, you may bring the matter to the attention  of the appropriate Privacy Commissioner. Some of our activities are  subject to the jurisdiction of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of  Canada; other activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the Privacy  Commissioner of your province of residence.</p>

       and will be interpreted left-to-right as least specific (highest-level attribution) to most specific. 

       For example...
       
       data.attribution = jirafe_parseAttribution(["atr1", "atr2", "atr3", "atr4"]);       

       ...will extract url parameters from...

       http://www.store.com?atr1=email&atr2=newsletter&atr3=2013-05&atr4=cta_button

       ...and set data.attribution to the following...

       data.attribution = ["email", "newsletter", "2013-05", "cta_button"];

    */
    data.attribution = jirafe_parseAttribution(["jirafe_atr1", "jirafe_atr2", "jirafe_atr3", "jirafe_atr4", "jirafe_atr5"]);

    
            var type = "other";
        

    jirafe_api.pageview(jirafe_org_id, jirafe_site_id, type, data);
}
