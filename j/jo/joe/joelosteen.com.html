						<p class="header"> Privacy Policy </p>
						<p>Your privacy on the Internet is extremely important to us. Because you
						  give us personal information, we believe you should fully understand
						  the terms and conditions surrounding what we do with that information.
						  This privacy statement discloses the information we gather, how we use
						  it, and how you can correct or change it. </p>
						<h4>Here's What We Do With Your Internet Provider (IP) Address </h4>
						<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and
						  to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify
						  you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. </p>
						<h4>Here's Why We Place A Cookie On Your Hard Drive </h4>
						<p>JoelOsteen.com uses a feature of your Internet Web browser that is called
						  a "cookie." A "cookie" is a file that your Web browser
						  places on your computer's hard drive. When you initially log on to JoelOsteen.com,
						  we create a "cookie" for your computer and then use it to track
						  your clicks as you go through the Web site. Approximately 95% of eCommerce
						  websites use "cookies" to help make their shopping cart work.

                          <li>To remember who you are. This allows us to auto
                            fill-in forms with information that you have previously
                            entered. </li>

						  you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have
						  the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
						  cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage
						  of some of JoelOsteen.com's coolest features, and we recommend that you
