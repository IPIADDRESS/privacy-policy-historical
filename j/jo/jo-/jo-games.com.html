            <h1 class="light-color-text">When Does BigRebelMedia Collect Personal Information?</h1>
            
            <p>BigRebelMedia collects personal information from you when you voluntarily submit that information to BigRebelMedia, for example: when you register on a Site; sign up for a subscription service; register for our e-newsletter service; participate in one of our sweepstakes, contests, or surveys; respond to an offer; purchase or rent products; or request to be on a mailing list. After you have registered your e-mail address on the Site and if you have clicked "Remember Me" or signed in to the Site, BigRebelMedia collects Site behavior and browser information as you navigate through the Site. This information may be used to create a profile that we keep on individual Users that details their preferences, personal information and behavior. Consequently, collected information is tied to the User's personally identifiable information and may be used to provide offers and improve the content of the Site for the User. This profile may also be used to tailor a User's visit to our Web Site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.</p>
            
            
            <h1 class="light-color-text">What Happens When I Register On The Web Site?</h1>
            
            <p>In order to use certain features of this Web Site, a User must first complete a registration process. During registration a User is required to provide basic contact information (such as name and e-mail address) and establish a password. Depending on the feature being used, the User may be required to provide other information associated with the use of that particular feature. For example, a User signing up for our subscription service will be required to provide an address for proof of location and financial information in the form of a credit card and expiration date for billing purposes,licensing porposes and future charges. Users signing up for our e-newsletter service may enter the types of games or games in which they are interested and about which they wish to receive information in the newsletter.</p>
            
            
            <h1 class="light-color-text">What Happens When I Place An Order On The Web Site?</h1>
            
            <p>Certain features of the Web Site do not require registration but may still require personal information to be entered, such as placing an order for a product. We request information from the User during the ordering process. For example, a User will be required to provide contact information (such as name, e-mail, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill Users' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the User.</p>
            
            <h1 class="light-color-text">Does BigRebelMedia Use Cookie Technology?</h1>
            
            <p>BigRebelMedia uses cookie technology to make your use of the Sites more convenient and to support our internal business purposes. A cookie is a piece of information that is transferred to a User's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. For example, BigRebelMedia uses cookies to remember your e-mail address so that you will not have to re-enter this information each time you visit the Site. BigRebelMedia also uses cookies to help track referrals from third party web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can set up your browser to alert you every time a cookie is offered, letting you decide whether or not to accept it. You can use and visit the Site with cookies disabled, but you will not automatically be recognized by the Site upon re-visiting. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our Sites' best features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>
            
            <h1 class="light-color-text">What Other Mechanisms Does BigRebelMedia Use to Track User Behavior?</h1>
            
            <p>Some Site web pages and HTML-formatted e-mails and e-newsletters use web beacons to compile statistics about Web Site usage. A web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. You may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies. </p>
            <p>BigRebelMedia and its third party vendors use web beacons to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage information and to compile statistical information about our Users in order to improve the Web Site's quality and to support our business. All data collected on behalf of BigRebelMedia is owned and used by BigRebelMedia. BigRebelMedia reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its Web Site visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for business partners.</p>
            <p>We also collect information in log files that include data such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We and our business partners use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track User's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. </p>
            
            <h1 class="light-color-text">How Does BigRebelMedia Handle Information from Children?</h1>
            
            <p>Please note that BigRebelMedia has no intention of collecting personal information from individuals under the age of 13 ("children"). We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

If a parent becomes aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we ask that the parent or legal guardian of the child contact us by visiting www.jo-games.com, selecting 'Contact Us'</p>
            
           
            <h1 class="light-color-text">How Does BigRebelMedia Use Personal Information?</h1>
            
            <p>Use of Personal Information is for our internal business purposes.

            <p>You may receive products and communications associated with your transactions with BigRebelMedia, such as rentals, purchases, subscriptions, sweepstakes and contests. You may also receive communications from BigRebelMedia related to transactions that appear to be from you or which appear to be fraudulent.

            <p>BigRebelMedia, its affiliates and franchisees (if permitted by BigRebelMedia) on occasion may disclose to their business partners certain data, such as names and addresses and the genre of products rented or purchased by Users or Members, so that the business partner may send their own direct marketing communications to Users and Members.
