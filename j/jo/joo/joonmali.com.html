										</p>
                <p>Use of Personal Subscriber Information.</p>
                <p>By the subscriber's use of the site, the subscriber expressly agrees that the site may use any personal information that has been provided by the subscriber or that has been collected by the site about the subscriber for any purpose, including without limitation, technical, administration, research and development, customer administration, marketing, trading in personal data, age verification, promotional and advertising use by the site or third parties authorized to use the information by the site.</p>

                <p>"OPT-IN" -- Some offers may be presented to the subscriber with the option to express the subscriberâ€™s preference by either clicking or entering "accept" (alternatively "yes") or "decline" (alternatively "no").
