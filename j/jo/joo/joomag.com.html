    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <strong>Updated as of December 20, 2009</strong>
    <section>
        <h2>Information we collect from you</h2>
        <p>
            Joomag’s servers automatically log standard technical information, such as your IP address,
browser type and language, and the date and time of your request. If you choose to register
with us, Joomag requires you to provide your name, email address, and each user has a user ID
and password that they choose. To maintain privacy it is important not to share your password
with anyone. Selecting a longer password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols makes it more
difficult for others to guess your password. It is also helpful to change passwords on a regular
basis. Joomag also uses “cookies” – small files containing a string of characters sent to your
computer that uniquely identifies your browser – in addition to Flash shared browser objects to
administer its website to enhance your online experience and to learn about how you use Joomag
services in order to improve the quality of our services.        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Information disclosure</h2>
        <p>
            Joomag does not share your personally identifiable information, including any of your user
profile data that you create, with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses.
<br><br>
Joomag may share personally identifiable information about our users with third parties, including:
(a) with your consent or as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy; (b) when we have a good faith
belief it is necessary pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order; (c)
where required by law; or (d) at our sole discretion, where we deem necessary to respond to
claims, to protect the safety of any individual or the public, or to protect the rights or
property of Joomag or any third party. We may disclose personally identifiable information
to affiliated companies, sub-contractors, other agents or businesses or persons to: provide
web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis
and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Joomag in improving it and creating
new service features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with
this Privacy Notice, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these
parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures to keep your information secure. Joomag may
also disclose to third parties anonymous aggregated user information that is not personally
identifiable.        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Joomag will take appropriate security measures designed to protect against unauthorized access to
or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of
our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical
security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
Joomag processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in
accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. Joomag takes
reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete,
and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever
necessary.
<br><br>
We endeavor to restrict access to personal information to Joomag employees, contractors and agents
who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These
individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and are required to meet these obligations.
<br><br>
If Joomag learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically
so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Joomag may post a notice on the website if a
security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice
of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should
notify us at privacy@joomag.com.        </p>

        <h2>Children Under 13</h2>
        <p>
            IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS JOOMAG AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.
<br><br>
Joomag complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and does not knowingly
collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such
persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us,
including your name, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal
information to or on Joomag. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has

change of control or any form of sale or transfer of some or all of its assets, we reserve the
right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected
from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.        </p>

or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will make reasonable efforts
to notify you and obtain your consent before implementing revisions with respect to such
information.        </p>
