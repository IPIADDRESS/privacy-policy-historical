<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the JOOR web site, which is located at http://jooraccess.com, as operated by JOOR, Inc. (the “Web Site”). The following Terms of Service (“TOS”) contain the terms and conditions that govern your use of the Web Site and the JOOR Service (as defined below). These TOS describe your rights and responsibilities and what you can expect from the JOOR Service. If you do not read, understand, and agree to all of the TOS, you may not use the Web Site.<br>
Given the dynamic nature of the JOOR Service, JOOR reserves the right to add to, delete or change these TOS at any time. As such, you should check these TOS from time to time for such changes.</p>
<p><strong>PRINCIPLES OF THE JOOR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>We don’t share your Personal Information with anyone except to comply with the law, to provide a service you have requested, to protect our rights, or as provided in this Privacy Policy.<br>
We don’t store Personal Information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS</strong></p>
<p>This privacy policy governs the use of the JOOR Web Site at http://jooraccess.com/ as operated by JOOR, Inc. (the “Web Site”). The Web Site, its operation by JOOR, Inc., and the services it provides (the “JOOR Services”) are collectively known as “JOOR” in this Privacy Policy.<br>
It covers how JOOR treats “Personal Information” — that is, personally identifiable like your name, address, and email address.<br>
This Privacy Policy is a part of the Terms of Service (“TOS”). Accordingly, when you click the “I Agree” button or access or use the Web Site or the JOOR Services, you agree that we can collect, use and disclose your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree or are not comfortable with any part of this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Web Site or the JOOR Services.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>JOOR collects Personal Information when you register with JOOR to use JOOR Services, or to post content on JOOR.</p>
<p>When you register, we ask for your email address.<br>
JOOR receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie, and the page you request in order to operate the JOOR Service.<br>
JOOR may use analytic tools or services to view aggregate statistics about the usage of the JOOR Service.</p>
<p><strong>IP ADDRESSES</strong></p>
<p>IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including:<br>
To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.<br>
To tailor advertising based on geographic area or other information derived from your IP address. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.<br>
To estimate the total number of users visiting JOOR from specific geographical regions.</p>
<p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a Web Site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive.<br>
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.<br>
JOOR uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:<br>
Access your information when you “sign in”.<br>
Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using JOOR’s services.<br>
Keep track of your Design File choices.<br>
Store credentials you may use to enable posting to other sites.<br>
Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.<br>
Conduct research to improve JOOR’s content and services.<br>
Since JOOR uses cookies to track, diagnose and service technology problems reported by our users or engineers, if you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use JOOR products or services that require you to “sign in,” and you may not be able to take full advantage of the JOOR Service.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE<br>
</strong><br>
Any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on message boards, in reviews and discussion areas, and within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others.<br>
We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send marketing messages unless you’ve opted in to receive such messages. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major JOOR Site changes, alerting you to messages from other JOOR members, or for customer service purposes).<br>
We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of JOORACCESS.com and to create new features, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends.<br>
If you post Personal Information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. JOOR does not rent or sell your Personal Information.<br>
JOOR will not share Personal Information about you with other people or other companies without your consent except to provide products or services you’ve requested and in the following circumstances:<br>
JOOR may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders or legal process or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;<br>
It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of JOOR’s terms of use, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. We will transfer information about you if JOOR is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, JOOR will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the JOOR Web Site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. JOOR may share demographic information with business partners, such as “53% of users who regularly use JOOR are boutiques” or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission (i.e. we will ask you for a quote or testimonial).<br>
We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.<br>
JOOR reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that JOOR believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our TOS, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our Web Site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of JOOR, our users or others.<br>
JOOR may contract with various third parties who help us provide and maintain the Web Site or the JOOR Service. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such third parties from disclosing your Personal Information, except for the purposes of providing the services in question. We cannot, however, guarantee that such parties will not disclose our Personal Information and will not be liable for any unauthorized use or disclosure by any third party.</p>
<p><strong>EDITING AND DELETING ACCOUNT INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>You can delete your JOOR username at any time. You can edit and change other account information at any time.<br>
We may send you certain communications relating to the JOOR Service, such as service announcements and administrative messages that are considered part of your JOOR account.<br>
You can delete your JOOR account at any time from your account page; however, please note that your identification and contact information may remain in JOOR’s records for some period.<br>
We limit access to Personal Information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.<br>
Your JOOR account information is password-protected.<br>
In certain areas, JOOR uses commercially available encryption protocols to protect data transmissions.</p>
<p><strong>DATA SECURITY AND CHANGE OF CONTROL</strong></p>
<p>JOOR uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to JOOR and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, JOOR makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<br>
If JOOR learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. JOOR may post a notice on the JOOR Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using by completing the Contact Us form with the appropriate request.<br>
In the event that JOOR is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES AND UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the “effective date” below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. In general, we only use your Personal Information in the manner described in the Privacy Notice in effect when we received the Personal Information you provided. Your continued use of the JOOR Site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Notice and any future revisions.<br>
For revisions to this Privacy Notice that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of the Personal Information you have already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.<br>
