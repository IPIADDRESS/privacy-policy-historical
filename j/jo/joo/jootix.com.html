Privacy Policy
</p>
<p>
The privacy of our visitors is important to us.
</p>
<p>
At jootix.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal information 
is important. Here is information on what types of personal information 
we receive and collect when you use and visit jootix.com, and how we 
safeguard your information. We never sell your personal information to 
third parties - except official investigation cases.
</p>
<p>
Log Files<br>
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in 
log files.&nbsp; The information in the log files include&nbsp; your IP (internet 
protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet 
Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you 
visited throughout our site.
</p>
<p>
Cookies and Web Beacons<br>
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal 
preferences when you visit our site.&nbsp; This could include only showing 
you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our 
features, such as forums.
</p>
<p>
We also use third party advertisements on jootix.com to support our 
site.&nbsp; Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and 
web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these 
advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) 
information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used 
to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.&nbsp;
This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real
estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads 
based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone 
who frequents cooking sites).
</p>
<p>
DoubleClick DART cookies<br>
We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s 
DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are 
browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising 
(including some Google AdSense advertisements).&nbsp; This cookie is used to 
serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based 
targeting”).&nbsp; The ads served will be targeted based on your previous 
browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about 
visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when 
viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey).&nbsp; DART uses 
“non personally identifiable information”.&nbsp; It does NOT track personal 
information about you, such as your name, email address, physical 
address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers
or credit card numbers.&nbsp; You can opt-out of this ad serving on all 
sites using this advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or 
third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences
in programs such as Norton Internet Security.&nbsp; However, this can affect
how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.&nbsp; 
This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such 
as logging into forums or accounts.
</p>
<p>
Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any 
advertising program.&nbsp; Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, 
the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie 
will be added.
