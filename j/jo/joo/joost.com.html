          <h1>Joost<sup>®</sup> Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>Last Updated: January 2009</p>
          <p>Joost is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the Joost® website located at www.joost.com and its directly associated domains (the "<em><strong>Site</strong></em>") and has established and implemented this Privacy Policy to help you make informed decisions when using the Site (we refer to the services made available through the Site, collectively, as the "<em><strong>Joost Features"). "<em><strong>Joost" (and "<em><strong>we", "<em><strong>us" and "<em><strong>our") means Joost Technologies B.V. This Privacy Policy also applies to your use of the Joost® Application for the Apple® iPhone™ (the "<em><strong>Joost Application</strong></em>"). Any reference to the Site will also refer to the Joost Application.</strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></p><em><strong><em><strong>
          <p>This policy answers the following questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</p></li>
            <li><p>Will we share your personal information with third parties?</p></li>
            <li><p>What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</p></li>
            <li><p>Who can I contact if I have any questions about this Privacy Policy?</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>By accessing the Site or using any of the Joost Features, you consent to Joost's collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site and not to any other website that you may be able to access from the Site which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.</p>
          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          <h3>Registration and Your Personal Profile</h3>
          <p>When you register with the Site, you provide us with certain personal information, such as a username (which may or may not be your real name), email address, gender, zip/postal code and date of birth.</p>
          <p>When you use the Site or Joost Features, you will have the option of setting up a personal profile by providing general information about yourself, the URL of your website, address of your blog and a mood message.  Additionally, when using the Site or Joost Features, you will have the option to form relationships, send messages to your friends and other users, perform searches and queries, form groups, add applications, and transmit information through various channels.</p>
          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <p>Like many websites, we employ "cookies" in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information which is targeted to your interests and to make your online experience more convenient.  Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor's browser and are stored on the visitor's hard drive.  We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>to store a user's log-in identity so that your session won't expire unless you actively log out</p></li>
            <li><p>to keep a record of the programming or advertisements you were watching when you last left the Site</p></li>
            <li><p>to keep a record of any widgets or other additional applications that you have installed. </p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however, if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site or Joost Features.</p>
          <h3>Log Information</h3>
          <p>We also keep track of your interaction with the Site and other users. Specifically, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Site.  This information includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, which Joost Features you use and when and how long you use them, what programming and advertising you view and share with friends and how long you view it, your browsing history on the Site (including any links that you may click within the Site), your search history, and any social connections you have (i.e., your friends and the groups you have joined). </p>
          <h3>Slurping</h3>
          <p>You will have the opportunity to connect with friends from your other networks, such as AOL, Gmail, LinkedIn, Hotmail and Yahoo.</p>
          <p>The Site will identify the email addresses of the friends in your other networks, and if any of these friends are already Joost® users, we will offer you the opportunity to connect as friends on Joost®, and if you choose to do so, a friend request will be sent by email. If any of your friends are not Joost® users, we will enable you to invite those friends to join Joost®. You will be able to select those friends in your other networks that you wish to invite (if any), and Joost will send one email on your behalf to each of these friends inviting them to visit the Site and register as a Joost® user. If any of your friends respond to your invitation, and subsequently register as Joost® users, you will offered the opportunity to connect as friends on Joost®. If you choose to connect, a friend request will be sent by email.</p>
          <p>After this process is complete, and any email invitation(s) have been sent, your friends' email addresses will be deleted from our servers (unless they have registered separately as Joost® users). We will not retain or use these email addresses for any purpose whatsoever, and will not contact your friends or create any connections unless you ask us to.</p>
          <p>If your email address appears in anyone else's network, Joost may use your email address for the purposes described above.</p>

Where these third parties process information on our or your behalf, we require these third parties to comply with the provisions of this Privacy Policy, to the extent applicable, and require that they maintain high levels of security and do not use your information for any purpose other than to provide their services to us.  If these third parties need to collect personally identifiable information or personal data direct from you, we require them to do so under the terms of an effective and publicly available privacy policy.  Joost is not responsible for their compliance with such a policy.</p>
          <h3>With our Affiliated Companies</h3>

The sections below headed "Using Your Personal Information In Other Countries" and "EU Safe Harbor Compliance" provide more information in this regard.</p>
          <h3>As Otherwise Required</h3>
          <p>We will share personal information we collect from you if we believe it is reasonably necessary to make available the Site and Joost Features, legally required, or otherwise permitted by you.  For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p><em>Protection of rights</em>.  We will share personal information if we have a good faith belief that (i) access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process anywhere in the world, such as a court order or subpoena, or a request by law enforcement or governmental authorities, (ii) such action is appropriate to enforce the Terms of Service for the Site, including any investigation of potential violations thereof, (iii) such action is necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues associated with the Joost Features, or (iv) such action is appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of Joost, its employees, users of the Joost Features or others.</p></li>

If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our or our affiliates' assets or voting securities, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of the Site and Joost Features, may be included in the transferred assets or securities.  If this occurs, your personal information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Third Parties Who Collect and Receive Your Information</h2>
          <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
          <p>The Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on Site activity for us and providing other services relating to Site activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.  Google's use of this data is governed by the Google Analytics Terms of Service (<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html</a>) and Privacy Policy (<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html">http://www.google.com/privacy.html</a>).</p>
          <h3>Facebook Connect</h3>
          <p>If you have a Facebook account, Joost allows you to log in using Facebook Connect ("Connect"), a Facebook, Inc. application that enables the Site to work just like the platform applications you find on Facebook.com ("Facebook"). Once you allow the Site to connect with Facebook, you will be able to use your Facebook login information to log into the Site, and you will be able to publish your activity on the Site to your Facebook profile.  Whenever to do anything on the Site that you might want to publish to Facebook, such as watching or commenting on a video, we will ask you whether you want to publish that activity on your Facebook news feed.  We will not generate or publish any Facebook news feed and/or other stories about actions you take on the Site without your permission. Additionally, by using Connect, you permit the Site to: access Facebook information related to you (including your profile information, friends, and privacy settings) so you can use your Facebook information on the Site, and so that we can help improve your use of the Site and the Joost Features (for example, by recommending programming or delivering advertising that we think will be of most interest to you); and allow you to interact with your Facebook friends on the Site. In order to make Connect possible, you agree to allow Facebook to check your Facebook cookies when you are visiting the Site, and allow Facebook to receive information concerning the actions you take on the Site (which we will only send with your permission). The information shared with Facebook will be transmitted to and stored by Facebook on servers in the United States.  In the event you no longer want the Site to publish stories about you, or want to otherwise limit the ways in which the Site interacts with your Facebook account, you can always disable this feature by changing your application settings in Facebook.</p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by Joost through your Facebook Connect login, however, your activities on Facebook are covered by the Facebook privacy policy and other terms of use (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php">http://www.facebook.com/terms.php</a>; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">http://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>).</p>
          <h3>Third Party Applications</h3>
          <p>We, and third parties, may from time to time make small software applications – that we sometimes call "widgets" – available for your use on or through the Site. These applications may separately access, and allow a third party to view, your identifiable information, such as your name, your username, your computer's IP Address or other information such as what you are watching during any given session, and any cookies that you may previously have installed or that were installed for you by a third party software application or website. Additionally, these applications may ask you to provide additional information directly to third parties. Third party products or services provided through these applications are not owned or controlled by Joost. You are encouraged to read the terms of use and other policies published by such third parties on their websites or otherwise before you use such applications.</p>
          <p>By using the Site and Joost Features, you consent to the processing of data about you by us, Google, Facebook or other third parties in the manner set out above. </p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third party websites.  Although we encourage third parties to adopt and follow their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of your personal information.  You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.</p>
          <h2>Control of Your Information</h2>
          <p>You post content on the Site at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your profile, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your profile and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your content.</p>
          <p>You can access and update most of your personal information through the use of the Site. If you wish to review and/or correct any personal information not yet available through the use of the Site, please send a request to <a href="mailto:privacy@joost.com" title="Send email to: privacy@joost.com">privacy@joost.com</a> and we will attempt to fulfill your request.  We may choose not to fulfill any request that we determine is unreasonable, unduly burdensome or impractical or that constitutes a threat to the privacy or rights of others. </p>
          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>We take many precautions to keep your personal information secure from unauthorized access, such as internal corporate policies to limit access to systems that store your personal information. We continue to store your personal information for so long as it is necessary to provide you our service and periodically destroy old personal information in accordance with our company policies, including when it is no longer necessary in order to offer you the same high quality service. In most cases, we will keep one archival copy of your information to allow us to comply with laws or respond to legal processes.</p>
          <h2>Using Your Personal Information in Other Countries</h2>
          <p>Your country's privacy laws may require your consent before your personal information can be exported to countries with weaker privacy laws. This Privacy Policy requires your consent to this practice so that we can enhance our service quality by operating in multiple countries. No matter where your information is processed, this Privacy Policy will remain in effect.</p>
          <p>By accessing or using the Site or any Joost Features, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States, any Member State of the European Union, and at Joost's discretion, any other country of the world.</p>
          <h2>EU Safe Harbor Compliance</h2>
          <p>Our US affiliates adhere to the European Safe Harbor principles as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information collected from citizens of the European Union.
