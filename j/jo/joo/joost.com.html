</ul>

<p>By using the Site or Services you consent to this Privacy Policy.  We may sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may work with other third party businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members via direct mail, email and telemarketing. </p>

<h2 id="infomanage">Managing Your Information Preferences</h2>
<p>You can always review, correct, update, or change your personal information, or opt out of our direct marketing
  efforts, by changing the relevant setting in your Joost profile or account (if available), or by e-mailing us at
  <a href="mailto:privacy@joost.com">privacy@joost.com</a>.  If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy
  Policy, please e-mail us at
  <a href="mailto:privacy@joost.com">privacy@joost.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="infocollect">Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Registration and Your Personal Profile</h3>

<p>When you register with the Site or the Service, you provide us with certain personal information, such as a username
  (which may or may not be your real name), email address, gender, zip/postal code and date of birth. The decision to
  provide this information is optional.  However, if you choose not provide the requested information, you may not be able
  to use certain features of the Site or Services.</p>

<p>When you use the Site or the Services, you will have the option of setting up a personal profile by providing general
  information about yourself, the URL of your website, address of your blog and a mood message. Additionally, when using
  the Site or the Services, you will have the option to form relationships, send messages to your friends and other users,
  perform searches and queries, form groups, add applications, comment on particular content, and transmit information
  through various channels.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Like many websites, we employ "cookies" in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information which is
  targeted to your interests and to make your online experience more convenient. Cookies are small bits of electronic
  information that a website sends to a visitor's browser and are stored on the visitor's hard drive. We use cookies for
  the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to store a user's log-in identity so that your session won't expire unless you actively log out</li>
  <li>to keep a record of the programming or advertisements you were watching when you last left the Site</li>
  <li>to keep a record of any widgets or other additional applications that you have installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Certain third parties will also place and read cookies in your browser. Further information on this can be found
  below in the section "Third Parties Who Collect And Receive Your Information".</p>

<p>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however, if you do this,
  you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site or the Services. For further information on cookies and
  how to disable cookies, please visit
  <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.
</p>

<h3>Log Information</h3>
<p>We also keep track of your interaction with the Site, the Services, and other users. Specifically, our servers
  automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Site or Services. This information
  includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, which features you use and when and how
  long you use them, what programming and advertising you view and share with friends and how long you view it, your
  browsing history on the Site and the Services (including any links that you may click within the Site or the
  Services), your search history, and any social connections you have (i.e., your friends and the groups you have
  joined).</p>

<h3>Slurping</h3>
<p>You will have the opportunity to connect with friends from your other networks, such as AOL, Gmail, LinkedIn,
  Hotmail, Netlog and Yahoo.</p>

<p>The Site will identify the email addresses of the friends in your other networks, and if any of these friends are
  already Joost® users, we will offer you the opportunity to connect as friends on Joost®, and if you choose to do so, a
  friend request will be sent by email. If any of your friends are not Joost® users, we will enable you to invite those
  friends to join Joost®. You will be able to select those friends in your other networks that you wish to invite (if
  any), and Joost will send one email on your behalf to each of these friends inviting them to visit the Site and
  register as a Joost® user. If any of your friends respond to your invitation, and subsequently register as Joost®

  commenting on a video, we will ask you whether you want to publish that activity on your Facebook news feed. We will
  not generate or publish any Facebook news feed and/or other stories about actions you take on the Site without your
  permission. Additionally, by using Connect, you permit the Site to: access Facebook information related to you
  (including your profile information, friends, and privacy settings) so you can use your Facebook information on the
  Site, and so that we can help improve your use of the Site and the Joost Features (for example, by recommending
  programming or delivering advertising that we think will be of most interest to you); and allow you to interact with
  your Facebook friends on the Site. In order to make Connect possible, you agree to allow Facebook to check your
  Facebook cookies when you are visiting the Site, and allow Facebook to receive information concerning the actions you
  take on the Site (which we will only send with your permission). The information shared with Facebook will be
  transmitted to and stored by Facebook on servers in the United States. In the event you no longer want the Site to
  publish stories about you, or want to otherwise limit the ways in which the Site interacts with your Facebook account,
  you can always disable this feature by changing your application settings in Facebook.</p>

  such as what you are watching during any given session, and any cookies that you may previously have installed or that
  were installed for you by a third party software application or website. Additionally, these applications may ask you
