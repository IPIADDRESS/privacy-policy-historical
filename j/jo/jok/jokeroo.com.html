<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Jokeroo.com is operated by Jolted Media Group Ltd. In this Policy, we will refer
to Jolted Media Group or Jokeroo.com as “Jokeroo”, “our”,
“us” or “we.”</p>

<p>We
take your privacy seriously. We are providing this Policy to inform
you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and
disclosure of information on our Service. We also want to inform you
about your choices regarding information. If you have any questions
or concerns, please let us know (see “How to contact us”
section below).</p>

<p>Note
that this Policy may be modified from time to time in our sole
discretion, so check back frequently.</p>

<a name="s1"></a>
<h3>1. How we collect information</h3>
<p>We collect information in three basic ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>We collect information that you voluntarily provide to become a
	registered User of our Service, and when you use certain aspects of
	our Service (e.g., entering an email address on a form to send an
	email from your Jokeroo account).</li>

<li>We
	collect information when you register to join Jokeroo by logging
	into an account that you already have with certain third-party
	social networking sites (“SNS”) (including, but not
	limited to, Facebook and Twitter) via our Service. For example, our
	Service allows you to create an account and login to the Service
	using your Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect. If
	you are not currently registered as a User on the Service and you
	click on “Sign in Using Facebook,” you will first be
	asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the
	option to register and join Jokeroo.</li>
<li>When
	you browse or use our Service, technological tools including “Log
	Data” and “Cookies” collect certain information,
	as explained in the following section.</li>
</ol>

<a name="s2"></a>
<h3>2. What information we collect and how we use it</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Personal Information.</strong>
	When
	you register with us through the Service to become a registered User
	of Jokeroo, we will ask you for certain information about you that
	can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal
	Information”). Personal Information may include, but is not
	limited to, your name, gender, profile photo, free-form biography,
	location/hometown, website and email address. If you decide to
	create your User account by logging into a SNS via the Service, you
	are using the Personal Information you have already provided to the
	SNS (such as your “real” name, email address and other
	information you make publicly available via the SNS) to create your
	User account on our Service; the information we collect may depend
	on the privacy settings you have with the SNS, so please consult the
	SNS’s privacy and data practices. For example, by using
	Facebook Connect, you are allowing Jokeroo to access the Personal
	Information in your Facebook account pursuant to the Facebook Terms
	of Use regarding your use of the Service via Facebook.
	We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with
	your “Non-Identifying Information,” see below) to
	provide the Service to you. For example:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Account registration.</strong>
		We create your User account for your use of the Service based upon the Personal Information you provide.
	</li><li>
		<strong>Communications.</strong>
		We use your Personal Information to contact you with Jokeroo
		newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other
		information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any
		time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from
		us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of
		the communications or update your “preferences”
		information in your account settings. (See “Your choices
		regarding information,” below.)
	</li><li>
		<strong>Customer service.</strong>
		We use your Personal Information to respond to your questions and/or inquiries.
	</li><li>
		<strong>Finding friends.</strong>
		You also have the option to import your personal contacts (including
		email addresses of friend lists via SNS) to the Service so that you
		can find your friends on the Service, and your friends can find you
		on the Service.
	</li><li><strong>Emailing via a Jokeroo Account.</strong>
		As part of the Service, Jokeroo Users may communicate with other
		registered and non-registered Users through use of their Jokeroo
		accounts. Where Users have selected the option of adding one or
		more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in
		the corresponding template will be sent from Jokeroo to those email
		addresses on their behalf.
	</li>
</ol>
</li><li><strong>Non-Identifying Information.</strong>
	We also collect other information that you provide as part of
	registration, the operation, and personalization of your boards on
	Jokeroo that cannot reasonably be used to identify or contact you
	(e.g., without limitation, age and individual preferences)
	(“Non-Identifying Information”). Certain Non-Identifying
	Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information
	if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining
	your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to
	be personally identified or contacted. But the same pieces of
	information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are
	taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying Information
	(for example, your viewing preferences) 
	We
	may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying
	Information and aggregate it with information collected from other
	Jokeroo Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to
	improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and
	understand how our Service is used. We may also use the combined
	information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for
	instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences
	or restrictions.
</li><li>
	<strong>Mobile Software.</strong>
	Our Mobile Software allows Users to access and use the Service from
	their mobile devices. From the Mobile Software, in the event that
	our Mobile Software crashes on your mobile device, we will receive
	information about your mobile device model, software version and
	device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and
	otherwise improve the performance of our Mobile Software.
</li><li>
	<strong>Log Data.</strong>
	When you visit the Service, whether as a registered User or a
	non-registered User just browsing, our servers automatically record
	information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website
	(“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such
	as the browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came
	to our Service, pages of our Service that you visit, the time spent
	on those pages, information you search for on our Service, access
	times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to
	monitor and analyze use of the Service and the Service’s
	technical administration, to increase our Service’s
	functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our
	Service to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this
	information is collected so that when you visit the Service again,
	it will recognize you and the information could then be used to
	serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your
	interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to
	the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests.
</li><li><strong>Cookies.</strong>
	Like many online services, Jokeroo uses “cookies” on our
	Service to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that
	we transfer to your computer or mobile device’s hard disk. We
	use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize “persistent”
	cookies to save your login information for future logins to the
	Service. Second, we utilize “session ID” cookies to
	enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you
	interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage by Jokeroo
	Users and web traffic routing on the Service. Unlike persistent
	cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log
	off from the Service and then close your browser.a
	You
	can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop
	accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from
	the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you
	may not be able to use all portions of the Service or all
	functionality of the Service. (See “Your choices regarding
	information,” below.)
</li></ol>

<a name="s3"></a>
<h3>3. Sharing of your information</h3>
<ol><li>
	<strong>Jokeroo Users.</strong>
	When you register through the Service and submit Personal Information to
	create a profile or visual collection, other Jokeroo Users will see
	your name. If you choose to provide additional Personal Information
	in your profile, Jokeroo Users will see such additional Personal
	Information, including, but not limited to, your photo, location,
	website and biography. Providing additional Personal Information is
	voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you
	want to have with Jokeroo Users. We recommend that you guard and
	refrain from disclosing any information you consider sensitive and
	confidential.
</li><li>
	<strong>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</strong>
	We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal
	Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying
	Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis,
	demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information
	shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
</li><li>
	<strong>Service Providers.</strong>
	We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our
	Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform
	Service-related services (e.g., maintenance services, database
	management, web analytics and improvement of the Service’s
	features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Service are used.
	These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to
	perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose
	or use it for any other purpose.
</li><li>
	<strong>Social Networking Sites.</strong>
	We may share the information in your Jokeroo account (including your
	Personal Information) with the SNSs that you have linked to your
	Jokeroo account. These third parties have access to your Personal
	Information only for this purpose (unless the SNS has received your
	Personal Information independently of the Service) and not for other
	purposes.
	<ul><li>
		<strong>Facebook Connect and Twitter.</strong>
		We allow Users to link their Facebook and Twitter accounts to our
		Service. Users can then post recent activity on our Service back to
		their Facebook and Twitter accounts. You will be prompted to decide
		whether or not your activity on the Service will be shared and
		disclosed on your Facebook/Twitter service. You can disable the
		foregoing feature at any time by logging into your profile and
		selecting the option to disable Facebook Connect and/or Twitter.
		Further, you may be able to edit your privacy settings for the
		content that you post which appears on Facebook/Twitter by making
		selections in your “Edit Profile” settings via the
		Service.
	</li></ul>
</li><li>
	<strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</strong>
	Jokeroo cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private
	parties to enforce and comply with the law. We can disclose any
	information about you to government or law enforcement officials or
	private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or
	appropriate to respond to claims and legal process including, but
	not limited to, subpoenas, to protect the property and rights of
	Jokeroo or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any
	person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to
	pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable
	activity.
</li><li>
	<strong>Business Transfers.</strong>
	Jokeroo may sell, divest, transfer, assign, share or otherwise engage in a
	transaction that involves, some or all of our assets, including any
	or all of the information described in this Policy, in the course of
	a corporate divestiture, merger, acquisition, joint venture,
	bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or any other similar
	transaction or proceeding.
</li></ol>

<a name="s4"></a>
<h3>4. Your choices regarding information</h3>
<p>You have several choices regarding the use of information on our Service:</p>

<ol><li>
	<strong>Email Communications.</strong>
	If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive email
	communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions
	provided in any of the communications or update your “preferences”
	information in your account settings
</li><li>
	<strong>Cookies.</strong>
	If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies
	from our Service for any of the purposes described above, then you
	can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop
	accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from
	the websites you visit. Consult your browser’s technical
	information. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be
	able to use all portions of the Service or all functionality of the
	Service. If you have any questions about how to disable or modify
	cookies, please let us know at the contact information provided
	below.
</li><li>
	<strong>De-Linking SNS.</strong>
	If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to have your SNS
	account (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) linked to your Jokeroo account,
	then you may de-link the SNS account in the “preferences”
	section in your account settings.
</li><li>
	<strong>Changing or Deleting Your Information.</strong>
	All Users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information
	in their User account (including any imported contacts) by
	contacting us or by editing their profile via the Service. If you
	completely delete all of your Personal Information, then your User
	account may become deactivated. We will use commercially reasonable
	efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of
	your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
	(For more information on how to control your User Content on the
	Jokeroo Service, including information regarding the use and storage
	of your User Content, please see the “Sharing Your Content”
	section in our <a href="http://www.jokeroo.com/s/terms.html">Terms of Service.</a> )
</li></ol>

<a name="s5"></a>
<h3>5. Links to other sites and services</h3>
<p>Our Service contains links to other third-party websites and online
services. If you choose to visit another website or online service by
clicking on a link, you will be directed to that third party’s
website or online service. The fact that we may link to a website or
online service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation
of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of
their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do
not exercise control over third party websites and online services,
and these third parties may place their own cookies or other files on
your computer and collect data or solicit Personal Information and
Non-Identifying Information from you. Other sites and online services
follow different rules regarding the collection, use and/or
disclosure of Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the
other websites or online services you visit before providing any
information or using such websites or services.</p>

<a name="s6"></a>
<h3>6. How we store and protect information</h3>
<ol><li>
	<strong>Information Security.</strong>
	We care about the security of your information. We use commercially
	reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of
	information collected and maintained through the Service. However,
	we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
	provide to us or guarantee that information on the Service may not
	be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized
	persons.
</li><li>
	<strong>Phishing.</strong>
	Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are
	of great concern to Jokeroo. Safeguarding information to help
	protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not request
	your credit card information, login information, or national
	identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or
	telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit
	the Federal Trade Commission’s <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">website</a>.
</li><li>
	<strong>Breach Notification.</strong>
	We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the
	security, confidentiality, or integrity of stored “personal
	data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security
	breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this
	Service in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable
	delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law
	enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of
	the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
</li><li>
	<strong>International Transfer</strong>
	Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on —
	computers located outside of your state, province, country or other
	governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as
	protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside
	the United States and choose to provide information to us, Jokeroo
	transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it
	there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your
	submission of such information represents your agreement to that
	transfer.
</li></ol>

<a name="s7"></a>
<h3>7. Advertising Policies</h3>
<p>We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may
contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site,
cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and
we do not have access to this information. To try and bring you
offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other
companies that we allow to place ads on our Web pages. As a result of
your visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information
such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream
information.</p>
<p>We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain
anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies
may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream
information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements
clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web
sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically
use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.
To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to
opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/">networkadvertising.org</a></p>

<h3>8. Our policy towards children’s information</h3>
<p>This Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly
collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has
provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or
she should contact us at
