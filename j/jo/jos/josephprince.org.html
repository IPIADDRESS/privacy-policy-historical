We may use such information or any information you do provide  to monitor our website’s performance, and to make improvements where necessary. </p>
      <p class="content"><strong>Information Stored Automatically</strong><br>
      By default,  all web server log files capture Internet Provider (IP) addresses. We may use  your IP address internally to help diagnose problems with our server,  administer our website and to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorised  attempts to upload or change information, or cause damage.</p>
      <p class="content"> A cookie is a small amount of information sent from a web  server to your computer. We use cookies when someone logs onto our website to  maintain that login, to retain login information (if requested) and for the  maintenance of our shopping cart service. Any activity you engage in while you  are at the Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc. website may be tracked. We do not use  cookies to track your Internet activity before you enter or after you leave our  website. </p>

      <p class="content"> When you  place an online order or make an online donation, you will be required to  provide your name, email address, mailing address, contact number, payment card  details and/or other information (e.g. special delivery instructions). We may  share selected information with our agents, sub-contractors (e.g. shipping  company) and/or third parties (e.g. the issuer of your payment card) for the  sole purpose of delivering the product(s) you requested or processing your  donation.</p>
      <p class="content"> When you participate in any contest or promotion, we may ask  for your name, address, email address and/or other information so we can  administer the contest/promotion and notify winners.</p>

      <p class="content">To  make online giving and shopping at the Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc. website a safe  and secure experience, we use a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) capable browser.  This means that any credit/debit card information you send is encrypted by your  computer, and then decrypted again on our server, making it extremely difficult  for others to access your private information during transmission.</p>
      <p class="content">While we will make reasonable efforts to store any personal information which we hold  in a secure server or in secure files, and to keep this information accurate  and up-to-date, the Internet is not a secure medium for the transmission of  information. Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc. cannot accept responsibility for the  security of information you send to or receive from us over the Internet or for  any unauthorised access to or use of that information.</p>
