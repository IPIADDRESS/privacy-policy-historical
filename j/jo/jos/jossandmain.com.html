      How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="margin_med_left med_copy one_and_a_half_space">
      Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to
      have his or her online activity and behavior tracked.  If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting
      certain information about the browser's user.  Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.  For this reason, many digital service operators, including Wayfair,
      do not recognize or respond to DNT signals.
