      <p>Jostens, Inc., located at 3601 Minnesota Drive, Suite 400, Minneapolis, MN 55435, and its corporate affiliates  (collectively, "<strong>Jostens</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>our</strong>," <strong>or</strong> "<strong>us</strong>") are your most trusted partners in celebrating moments that matter, and we value that trust.  This Privacy Policy (the "<strong>Policy</strong>") explains how we collect and use information  through jostens.com, services available through jostens.com such as Yearbook  Avenue and YearTech Online, and our other websites, applications, widgets,  services, and interactive properties on which this Policy appears (each, a "<strong>Property</strong>"), and your choices with respect to our collection and use of information.

          <td width="565"> <p class="tab3"><strong>Information Provided to Us.</strong></p>
            <p class="tab3"><em>Information from You</em>. We collect personal information (information that identifies you as an individual) and other information from you through your use of this Property. This includes, but is not limited to, where you request information about, register for, or use a product or service available through this Property; where you purchase a product or service through this Property; where you respond to a survey; where you register or create a user profile on a Property; and where you are entering a contest or a promotion, ordering a newsletter or utilizing other informational tools.  Examples of the type of information we collect include, but are not limited to, your name, e-mail address, Internet Protocol (IP) address, age, gender, the name of the school you attend, billing and/or shipping address, phone number, payment account information, and other information about you, your preferences and interests.  We also collect information that you provide to Jostens directly through your contact with our customer service representatives and sales associates, and that you provide to Jostens via Jostens independent sales representatives.</p>   
      <p class="tab3"><em>User Content.</em> If you use this Property to submit photographs, user profiles, audiovisual materials, questions, comments or other content (collectively, "<strong>User Content</strong>"), we can reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use submitted User Content in any media or format currently existing or later developed. We can also provide access to User Content to others. Certain personal information, such as your name and email address, can be publicly displayed along with and/or associated with your User Content.  Please think carefully before deciding what information you share as User Content. Please note that we do not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you provide.  If you provide us with any ideas, comments, suggestions, or other feedback related to Jostens' products, services or business, you grant us a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide right to use it for any purpose related to our business without compensation to you. Please note that your use of Properties through which you can provide User Content is subject to our <br><a href="http://www.jostens.com/apps/shop/help/shared/terms.asp" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
      <p class="tab3"><em>Information You Provide About Others</em>.  If you initiate a communication to someone else through a Property such as through a "send-to-a-friend" feature, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we expressly advise otherwise. Please be aware that your name and/or email address could be included in any send-to-a-friend communication.</p>
      <p class="tab3"> <em>Information from Schools and Other Third Parties</em>.  In the course of our business and in providing our products and services, we receive personal information about individuals from our customers and partners, including schools.  We use this information to provide our products and services to our customers and consumers, and can use it for other purposes permitted under this Policy except to the extent the providing party has restricted our rights to use provided personal information.  Jostens will not sell or rent to any third party personal information provided by schools to Jostens.</p>
      <p class="tab3">We also acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information that you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to inform you of products, services and offers of interest, to target our communications, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.</p>
      <p class="tab3"><em>Information from Social Networking and Third Party Services</em>.  Functionality on a Property can permit interactions with social networking and other third party services  ("<strong>Social Features</strong>").  Examples of Social Features include enabling you to "like" or "share" content to other websites; to "like" or "share" our page on a third party service; or to log into a Property using your third party service username and password authenticated by the third party service.  If you connect your Jostens account with a third party service provider, it may share information about you with us.  If you choose to "like" or share content, that information and other information about you may be publicly displayed.  You should review the privacy policy of that third party service provider and check your privacy settings through that provider.  If you post information on a social networking or third party service that references Jostens or its products or services (e.g., via a Twitter hashtag), your post may be cross-published on a Property.</p>

        <tbody><tr>
          <td width="35" valign="top"><p align="right" class="tab"><strong>B</strong>.</p></td>
          <td width="565"><p class="tab3"><strong>Information Collected as You Access and Use a Property</strong>.  Like most websites and applications, we and our third-party service providers and advertisers use cookies and similar technologies to make our websites and applications work, as well as to learn more about our users and their likely interests as well as information relating to their visits and interactions with a Property.  These technologies include cookies, flash cookies, HTML5 cookies, tracking pixels, web beacons, and embedded scripts (collectively, "<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>"). We also collect information regarding your web browser or device, and collect geolocation information where you have allowed us or a third party advertiser or service provider to do so.</p>
          <p class="tab3"><em>Web Browser or Device Information</em>.  We collect information sent to us by your web browser or device, including your IP address, other information that does not identify you personally such as a device or browser token, the date and time of your visit, information about your web browser or device type, etc. The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser or device. If you have created a user identity or profile on one of your visits to a Property, we link the information provided by your browser or device to information that identifies you personally and use it for the purposes described in this Policy. Please review the settings of your web browser or device if you want to learn and change what information is sent by your browser or device.  If you access content on a Property via email, we or our third party provider can "hash" your email address, which converts your email address into a string of text that uniquely identifies your email address in a way that cannot be easily reversed.</p>
          <p class="tab3"><em>"Do Not Track" Headers</em>.  Some third party browsers provide "do not track" machine readable signals for websites which are automatically applied by default, and therefore do not necessarily properly reflect the choices of visitors to our property with respect to the collection of information via Tracking Technologies.  As a result, we do not respond to these signals.</p>
          <p class="tab3"><em>Geolocation Information</em>. We use your device's location services to determine your coarse (network-based) and fine (GPS-based) location via your device ("geolocation") in order to provide you with customized or geographically-specific content.  For example, ReplayIt® uses location services to provide users with a list of schools in the user's geographic area to make it easier for users to select an affiliated school. You can control whether your device allows applications to use location services through the mobile device settings for your device.  ReplayIt users can turn off these location services within the App by selecting the option to turn off location services in the application bar or other available functionality.</p>
          <p class="tab3"><em>Cookies</em>. A cookie is a data file placed on a computer.  We use both "session cookies" and "persistent cookies" to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier for you to use a Property, and to customize information that is presented to you through a Property. Session cookies are used to store information while a user accesses a Property, and expire when the user closes his/her browser "session." Persistent cookies store information across sessions (for example, to make it easier to log into a Property) and stay on your computer until the expiration date set in the cookie (for example, at the end of a calendar month) or until you delete it. We also use HTML5 local storage (also called "HTML5 cookies"), which is a newer, faster and more secure cookie technology used with the HTML5 web language.  Like traditional cookies, HTML5 local storage can be used as session storage or persistent storage.  We also use "Flash cookies," locally-stored data files used to personalize your use of a Property through Adobe Flash technologies. Flash cookies can also be used by our third party service providers to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.</p>
          <p class="tab3"><em>Web Beacons</em>. We use small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs," "clear GIFs," "single-pixel GIFs," "pixel tags," and "action tags") on a Property or in our email communications to you. We use web beacons for a number of purposes, such as to track browser types, to track the search terms and domain names that bring visitors to our Property, to count visitors to a Property, to monitor how users navigate a Property, and to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or how many particular links or content elements were actually viewed.</p>
          <p class="tab3"><em>Embedded Scripts</em>. We also use embedded scripts, which are programming code designed to collect information about how visitors interact with a Property, including where they came from and the manner in which they use it, and to deliver customized or targeted content to you on a property and through our partners. Embedded scripts are downloaded onto your device's cache from our web server or a third party service provider and are deactivated or deleted following the end of your session once your browser cache is cleared.</p>
