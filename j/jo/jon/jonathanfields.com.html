      <h3>You Don't Need A Bribe To Join My Tribe...</h3>
      <p>No shiny object, whiz-bang report or scratch-n-sniff screen protector.</p>
      <p>Just an invitation... Come and play. I'll be traveling the world, building ventures, writing, making art (badly), taking photos and doing my best to be a present dad and husband along the way.</p>
      <p>Once or twice a week, you’ll get an update with highlights, images, insights and excerpts.</p>
      <p>Go ahead, make it official...</p>

      <p><strong>Disclosure &amp; Other Legal Mumbo-jumbo.</strong></p>
      <p>We love that you're enjoying the cool stuff here. Our crack legal staff (a/k/a the cat) tells us we should let you know that you should assume the owner of this website is an affiliate for people, business (imaginary creatures, including but not limited to unicorns, elves, demigods and all manner of fairies) who provide goods or services mentioned on this website and in the videos or audio (or smoke signals). The owner (that'd be me, writing in the third person, but shhh, don't tell) may be compensated if you buy stuff from a provider. That said, your trust means everything to us and we don't ever recommend anything lightly (with the exception of when we're bribed with organic dark chocolate, because on those occasions anything goes!). Capisce!</p>
