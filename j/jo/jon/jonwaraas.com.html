<p>You can use programs such as <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a> to further control the collection of information regarding you online.</p>
<p><b>F. Information We Collect Automatically:</b> When you visit our Site, we automatically receive and store information about your visit on our servers. Our servers log your IP address, your page requests at our Site, and other information collected from “cookies”. A cookie is a small file that is sent to your computer’s browser or your mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies remain on your computer or device until they are deleted and tell us, for example, how you arrived at our Site (including search engines and search terms), how you navigate around our Site (including what articles you search for and browse), and what products or  services you purchase.</p>
<p>We also use cookies to to serve direct personalized marketing from JonWaraas.Com (including on other web sites). As explained in Section V of this Privacy Policy, most browsers allow you to block or reject cookies, although this may impact your ability to use features of our Site. JonWaraas.Com may combine information collected via cookies with Personal Information provided by you.</p>
<p>Along with cookies, we may deliver “web beacons” through our Site and/or e-mails to you which are associated with third-party advertising networks. Web beacons (also called “pixel tags”) are small graphic images that may not be visible to Site visitors that collect information about the usage of the Site on an anonymous basis. We may use web beacons in emails to determine device-type and learn if emails have been delivered and opened. JonWaraas.Com may also combine information from web beacons with Personal Information provided by you.</p>
<p>Web beacons also allow advertising networks to serve you JonWaraas.Com advertisements when you visit other websites. For example, a web beacon logs the articles you view at our Site, and then shows you an ad for similar articles from JonWaraas.Com when you browse to another website. Because your web browser receives advertising from the advertising network’s servers, these companies may set, view, or edit their own cookies or web beacons. Please note that we do not control the policies of any third parties, including the privacy policies of advertising networks.</p>
<p><b>II. E-mails We Send</b></p>
<p>If you place an order, create an account with us, or otherwise provide us your e-mail address, we may use that address to confirm your order, confirm the creation of an account, or to notify you of important information or changes to your account or our policies and practices.</p>
