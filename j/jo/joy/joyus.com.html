                <p>
                    The information we collect through our Site helps us provide you with information
                    specific to your needs and interests. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") covers
                    the Project J/Joyus website (the "Site"). Please read below to review our Privacy
                    Policy and the types of information we gather through our Site. In this Privacy
                    Policy, "we", "us", "our" and other similar references mean Project J and "you"
                    and "your" and other similar references mean a specific user of the Site. By visiting the
                    Site, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
                </p>

                <h3>2. How Does Project J Gather and Use Information?</h3>

                <p>
                    (i) Cookies. Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify
                    the browser on your PC. Websites typically use temporary cookies called "session"
                    cookies to ensure that you are recognized when you move from page to page within
                    one site and that any information you have entered is remembered. For example,
                    if an e-commerce site did not use session cookies then items placed in a shopping
                    basket would disappear by the time you reach the checkout. Websites also use cookies
                    called "persistent" cookies to enable a website to remember you on subsequent visits,
                    speeding up or enhancing your experience of services or functions offered. Project J
                    attempts to install both persistent and session cookies when a user arrives at our Site.
                    Cookies enable our systems to gather information about your navigational patterns
                    through the site. Viewers have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through
                    their browsers. Visit the "help" portion of your toolbar for more information. If you block
                    or refuse to accept cookies, or delete cookies between visits to the site, you may not be
                    able to access or use certain features or functions of our Site.
                </p>

                <p>
                    (ii) Server Statistics. We collect general statistics to track user trends on our Site. These
                    statistics include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to access our Site, page
                    views, and navigational patterns. The information that is collected in this manner does
                    NOT provide us with any personally identifiable information about our users. It helps us
                    track "where" our users are coming from. This allows us to pinpoint high traffic areas
                    and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our users. As part of that
                    ongoing analysis, Project J also uses devices called "web beacons" to help us identify
                    when emails sent to you have been received and read. In order to prevent the introduction
                    of viruses and hackers into the Project J site we may collect information, such as IP
                    addresses, into a log file to be used to identify potential hackers of the Project J site.
                </p>

                <p>
                    (iii) Personal Information You Provide Us. For the purposes of this Privacy
                    Policy, "Personal Information" is any information that identifies you, would enable
                    someone to contact you, or that describes your relationship with Project J. We collect and
                    store Personal Information when you register to use our Site, ask a question, complete a
                    form, conduct a transaction, or send us an email. While you are not required to submit
                    any information to our Site, if you do not provide the requested information, you may
                    not be able to access or use some of the features and functions of our Site and we may
                    not be able to provide you with certain services. Project J uses your Personal Information
                    to complete transactions, respond to your requests, deliver the products and services
                    you request, and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers (which may be
                    offered by Project J or one of its Site Affiliates via email) that we think may interest
                    you. If you are already receiving projectj.com emails and no longer wish to receive such
                    communications, simply follow the "unsubscribe" instructions that appear in every e-
                    email, or contact us to modify subscriptions.
                </p>

                <h3>3. What Security Procedures Does Project J Use To Protect Personal Information?
                </h3>

                <p>
                    We use physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to assist us in preventing
                    unauthorized access, maintaining data accuracy, and correctly using your Personal
                    Information. Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable
                    efforts to limit access to your Personal Information to the employees, agents, and officers
                    of Project J who need the information for their jobs.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Will Project J Disclose The Information It Collects To Outside Parties?</h3>

                <p>
                    Project J may share information with its subsidiaries and other affiliated companies,
                    and with other carefully selected vendors and business partners with whom we work
                    (collectively, "Site Affiliates"). This includes companies that offer affinity, frequent-user,
                    and reward programs; and, companies that perform marketing services and other business
                    operations for us (including providing goods and services to our users, as necessary to
                    complete transactions you request). All companies that act on our behalf are contractually
                    obligated to keep all information confidential and to use the customer information only to
                    provide the services we ask them to perform for you and us. We may provide aggregate
                    statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to
                    reputable third party vendors, but these statistics do not include Personal Information. We
                    may disclose Personal Information we collect from you if required to do so by law or in
                    the good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to obey the law or comply with legal
                    process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect and defend our rights or property or
                    the rights or property of other users of our Site; or (c) to act in an emergency to protect
                    the personal safety of users of our Site or the public. On a limited basis, we may also
                    disclose your Personal Information to certain Site Affiliates for their use in contacting
                    you, when we reasonably believe their products or services are complementary to your
                    interests or Project J's business.
                </p>

                <h3>5. External Links. Other companies or organizations may have links to their Sites on our
                    Site.</h3>

                <p>
                    We are not responsible for how these other companies or organizations collect, use,
                    disclose, or secure the information that you provide them. If you choose to access a
                    third party Site linked to our Site, you do so at your own risk and subject to any terms of
                    service or privacy policy (if any) associated with such third party Sites.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Collection Of Information From Children.</h3>

                <p>
                    Project J does not direct any of our content specifically to children. Users of our Site are
                    required to be at least 18 years old, and any user under 18 is not an authorized user. If we
                    learn that a user is under thirteen (13) years of age, we will promptly delete any Personal
                    Information we have collected about that user.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Consent To Processing In The United States.</h3>

                <p>
                    By providing any Personal Information to Project J, all users, including, without
                    limitation, users in Canada and the member states of the European Union, fully
                    understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of such
                    Personal Information across international borders in accordance with Project J's standard
                    operations, including the collection, storage, and processing of such information in the
                    United States of America.
                </p>

                <h3>8. Your California Privacy Rights.</h3>

                <p>
                    As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83, a California resident who has
                    provided Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has established a business
                    relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is
                    entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal
                    Information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In
                    general, if the business has made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt
                    of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third
                    parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as
                    well as a list of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed. However,
                    under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the
                    business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not
                    disclosing customer's Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing
                    purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the
                    business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the
                    law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal
                    Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. Except as expressly
                    stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their
                    direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically
                    by opting in to receive information from a third party that is participating in some activity
                    describes on our site. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its
                    marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific
                    activity, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To
                    prevent disclosure of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third
                    party, do not opt in to such use when you provide Personal Information on our site.
                    Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third
                    party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later
                    decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to
                    contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use
                    information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your
                    information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists
                    if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not
                    disclosing customer's Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing
                    purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the
                    business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with
                    the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal
                    Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their
                    direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically
                    by opting in to receive information from a third party that is participating in some activity
                    describes on our site. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for
                    its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific
                    activity, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To
                    prevent disclosure of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third
                    party, do not opt in to such use when you provide Personal Information on our site.
                    Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party,
                    your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide
                    that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the
                    third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You
                    should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to
                    determine how that entity will handle your information.

                    California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law

                    request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by
                    means other than through this email address.
