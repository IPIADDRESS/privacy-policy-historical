		<p>This Joydesk Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that Joydesk, LLC, a Washington limited liability company (“Joydesk”) collects when you use the Joydesk network of websites and/or our mobile services.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Joydesk does not own or control, or to people that Joydesk does not employ or manage.</p>

		<h2>Information Collection</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Joydesk collects personally identifiable information when you register for a Joydesk account, when you use certain Joydesk products or services, when you visit Joydesk pages, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes.</li>
			<li>Once you register with Joydesk and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. You will also select an ID and password that you will use to login to the Joydesk services. For your protection, we recommend not using personal information, such as your name or mobile phone number. </li>
			<li>Joydesk may also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Joydesk cookie information, and the page you requested. Joydesk uses information for three general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to contact you about Joydesk and third party specials and new products. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>We may disclose information that is collected about you to our affiliated and non-affiliated third-parties for purposes of marketing and to provide you with offers as to products they feel may be in furtherance of your interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Joydesk may sell and/or transfer your personally identifiable information to an affiliate and to any successor-in-interest as a result of a sale of any part of Joydesk's business or upon the merger, reorganization, or consolidation of Joydesk with another entity on a basis that Joydesk is not the surviving entity. For the purposes of this paragraph, "affiliate" means any person directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Joydesk. The term "control," as used in the immediately preceding sentence, shall mean with respect to any person, the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power, through the exercise of voting rights, contractual rights, or otherwise, to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of the controlled person. As used in this Privacy Policy, the term "person" includes any natural person, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust, unincorporated association or any other entity. </li>
			<li>Joydesk will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when: 
				<ul>
					<li>We have your consent to share the information; </li>
					<li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Joydesk to provide a product or service to you (unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us); </li>
					<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or </li>
					<li>We find that your actions violate the Joydesk Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Third Party Cookies
				<ul>
					<li>In the course of serving advertisements to users of our services, a third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Joydesk may, in its sole discretion, set and access Joydesk cookies on your computer and/or mobile device. </li>
			<li>Joydesk allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer and/or mobile device. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Joydesk cookies. </li>
			<li>Joydesk may, in its sole discretion, use web beacons (electronic images called a "single-pixel GIF" or "web beacon") that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies) to access our cookies within our network of web sites and in connection with Joydesk products and services </li>
			<li>In addition to the information collected by us and registration information submitted by you, we may employ both first-party and third-party cookies.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing activity-based information about you, and it is designed to facilitate the receipt of targeted and relevant advertisements.  The cookie is not associated with your personally identifiable information.<br>One of our third-party cookie partners is Datran Media (for information on Datran Media’s cookie program, please www.datranmedia.com/aperture).

		</ul>

		<h2>Other Use of Your Information</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Joydesk may use your personally identifiable information to send you information and updates via e-mail regarding your account with Joydesk and the services that Joydesk offers.</li>
			<li>Joydesk may use your personally identifiable information to send you information via e-mail regarding products and services offered by third parties, but only if you elect to receive such information.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Use of Joydesk Services by Minors</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The Joydesk services are not directed to children under the age of 13.  You must be at least 13 years of age to sign up or use the Joydesk services and each user who signs up or uses the Joydesk services represents to Joydesk that they are at least 13 years of age.</li>
			<li>The Joydesk services are available to people at least 13 years of age, but if you are between 13 and 18 years of age, you agree that you have received parental or guardian permission to provide personal information to the Joydesk services and to order and pay for any products or service through the Joydesk services.  </li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Security</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Joydesk follows generally accepted industry standards to protect all personal information sent to us, both during the transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however.

			<li>Certain communications from Joydesk (whether delivered via email), such as service announcements, administrative messages, and any Joydesk newsletters, are considered part of the Joydesk membership and you will automatically receive them. In addition, by collecting your cell phone and email address, Joydesk may from time-to-time send you additional promotional messages or messages from third party providers. An opportunity to opt-out of these messages will always be provided and all messages will be labeled as advertisements accordingly. </li>
			<li>You may, however, delete your Joydesk account by contacting support@Joydesk.com. You will need the following information to complete the process: Joydesk User ID, password, and email address. </li>
		</ul>

			<li>By using the Joydesk services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Joydesk Terms of Use.</li>
			<li>Any dispute as to these terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington and subject to the courts of law located in the State of Washington.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Joydesk may amend this policy from time to time, at our discretion. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by posting the changes here on these Privacy Policy pages.
