						    <h1>Use of Cookies</h1>
							<span class="bullet01">
							<ul>
							  <li>We use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience and time online. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize website pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized website experience. When you return to the website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing. 
You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on this website. 
</li>
					  </ul>
					  </span>
						<h1>Use of Web Beacons</h1>
					    <span class="bullet01">
							<ul>
							  <li>This website may contain electronic images known  as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count  users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web  beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they  are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our website  usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie  number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the  Web beacon resides. <br>
						        You may not decline web beacons, however, they  can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser  setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept  or decline cookies on an individual basis. <br>
					          Third parties are not permitted to use Web beacons on this website. </li>
					  </ul>
					  </span>
						<h1>Security </h1>
							<span class="bullet01">
							<ul>
							  <li>We may employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with industry practice.
