<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our site. 
</p>

<p>
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so that you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 
</p>

<p>
The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. 
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we or a data provider we have engaged may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content.   These cookies contain no personally identifiable information.  The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.

<h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons)</h3>
<p>
Our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
</p>

<h3>Targeted or Behavioral Advertising:</h3>
<p>
Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which Job.com advertisement should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than Job.com. For example, if you have shown a preference for nursing while visiting Job.com, you may be served an advertisement from Job.com for nursing related programs when you visit a site other than Job.com. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from Job.com or through third party website publishers. If you would like to opt out of targeted advertising from Job.com that occurs when visiting our third party advertising publishers, please <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">click here</a>. Please note that this will opt you out of targeted ads from Job.com and any other participating advertisers. If you opt out, you will continue to receive online advertising from Job.com; however, these ads may not be as relevant to you.
