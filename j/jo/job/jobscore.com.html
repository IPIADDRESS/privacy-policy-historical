TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to enable individuals and organizations to establish trusting relationships based on respect for personal identity and information by promoting the use of fair information practices.  This privacy statement covers the site www.jobscore.com.  Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users' privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.  By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, JobScore has agreed to notify users of: </p>

<ol>
	<li>What personally identifiable information of yours is collected by JobScore. </li>
	<li>How the information is used. </li>
	<li>With whom the information may be shared. </li>

<p><b>Information JobScore Collects</b> </p>
<p>JobScore collects a wide variety of Information as described in this Section that it uses to provide its membership services and general information services on its website ("Services").  JobScore generally provides Services to two "groups," Employers and Jobseekers.  Each is required to go through an enrollment process in order to use the Services.  In doing so, JobScore requires certain information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, job description, resume information, role(s), employment preferences, time zone, and/or credit card information (if you are using a paid-for service). JobScore also collects information related to your overall use of the Services.  JobScore also collects information related to discussions, chats, and other correspondence through the JobScore website. </p>
<p><b>Information Use</b></p>
<p>JobScore provides job matching services for Employers and Jobseekers.  Employers may use the Services as a way to manage the process of soliciting Jobseekers and managing the hiring process.  Jobseekers may use the Services to apply for specific jobs and also to be matched to other potential jobs.  For a complete description of the Services, please visit <a href="http://www.jobscore.com">www.jobscore.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>Sharing of Information</b></p>
<p>The Employer's job positions and corresponding information will be accessible by anyone through the use of the Services.  When an individual applies to a job at a JobScore Network employer, JobScore will share a Jobseeker's information with the Employer.  During the time that a new Jobseeker is under active consideration for a particular position, his/her information will not be generally available for viewing through the Services. After the applicable Employer's specific job position is no longer considered "active" by JobScore, the Jobseekers that applied to the applicable position will have their data generally available for presentation to other entities that JobScore thinks may have interest in based on collected preference information and system usage patterns.  Jobseekers who are already users of the Services prior to the posting of a position by an Employer that they apply for would have their information generally available through the Services regardless of whether they are under active consideration by one or more Employers. If a Jobseeker posts his/her information to the Services outside of a specific position listed by an Employer, the Jobseeker's information will also generally be available through the use of the Services. JobScore will notify a Jobseeker by e-mail after an Employer has accessed his/her information.</p>
<p>JobScore may also send newsletters and email notifications of promotions or other new information at JobScore and other information that JobScore thinks may be of interest.  JobScore will only share your credit card information with a credit card and/or shipping processor and SmashFly (if in the event you are paying for any portion of the Services provided by SmashFly) for the limited purpose of processing your credit card transaction.  Your credit card information is never generally accessible to third parties through the use of the Services.  JobScore may also enter into agreements with third parties to assist JobScore with the processing of information and the facilitation of JobScore's Services.  In addition, JobScore may enter into partnerships with third parties that provide products and services related to JobScore's Services that may be of interest to you ("Partners") and would therefore share non-financial information with such Partners. </p>
<p>JobScore may also use preference data to tailor your experience at JobScore's website, showing you content that JobScore thinks you might be interested in, and displaying content according to preferences.  JobScore may also use any information it collects to improve the Services.  JobScore may also use any information it collects from you for summary and statistical purposes and may share the foregoing to third parties, even if an Employer or Jobseeker Opts-Out.  The summary and statistical information will not contain any name and contact information. </p> 
<p>JobScore takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously.  JobScore will not otherwise sell your information to any third parties.</p>
<p><b>Public Forums</b></p>
<p>JobScore may make message boards, chat rooms, user forums, and the like available to its users and visitors.  Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personally identifying information. </p>
<p><b>Information Supplied by Your Browser</b></p>
<p>JobScore may also log IP addresses for systems administration purposes. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.
</p>

<p>We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name.  We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.</p>
<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p>The JobScore website uses cookies to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting or using JobScore. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, so that when you return to JobScore, JobScore can identify you and potentially provide you with a customized experience.</p>
<p>JobScore uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  JobScore uses session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the JobScore's site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's help file. 
</p><p>JobScore sets a persistent cookie to store your username, so you don't have to enter it more than once.  Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>

<p><b>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</b></p>
<p>JobScore and/or its third party advertising partner(s) employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help JobScore better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. JobScore does not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. </p>
<p><b>Legal Disclaimer</b></p>

<p><b>Opt-Out</b></p>
<p>A Jobseeker may opt-out of receiving further matching opportunities and other communications from JobScore and/or Partners by selecting the applicable do not contact field in his/her account.  JobScore will then no longer share your personal information with any Employers and will remove you from and its further communications in accordance with JobScore's standard removal schedules.  Please be aware that if your information has already been shared with an Employer in accordance with this Privacy Policy, that information will remain with the applicable Employer.  </p>

<p>An Employer may opt-out of receiving communications and using the Services by sending an e-mail to support@jobscore.com and requesting to no longer use the Services.  JobScore shall then make reasonable efforts to forward a copy of the Jobseeker data corresponding to any of the Employer's job opportunities, in a format determined by JobScore, within 30 days.  For the purposes of clarity, JobScore shall continue to have the right to use the foregoing as "Jobseeker data" in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Please be aware that if any Jobseeker information has already been shared with JobScore and/or another Employer in accordance with this Privacy Policy, that information will remain with the applicable Employer.</p>
<p><b>Correct/Update</b> </p>
<p>You may change or modify certain personal user and enrollment information by login into your user accounts and modifying the applicable information.  JobScore will update the information, as applicable, in accordance with JobScore's standard update schedules.
