<h3 id="7">7 Accessing your Data</h3>
<p>You are entitled to see the data held about you and ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure that it is accurate and kept up to date. If you wish to do this, please <a href="contactus.aspx">Contact Us</a> with your request.</p>

<p>Where the request is to see data that is held by Jobg8, proof of your identity will be required. Once the proof provided (passport, utility bill etc.,) has been checked, your documents (paper or electronic) will be destroyed, and the requested data will be sent. Jobg8 are committed to providing this data to you within 30 days of receiving your proof of identity. The copy of the data will be provided free of charge. However, there will be a charge of £10 when a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive. The fee is based on the administrative cost of providing the data.</p>

<h3 id="8">8 Data Backups</h3>

In the unlikely event of a backup being restored a data backup policy is in place to retrospectively apply any requested data changes.</p>
