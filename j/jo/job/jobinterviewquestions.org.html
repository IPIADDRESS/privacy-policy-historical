When you register an account or use certain of our services (including, but not limited to, Site email account(s), Resume Builder, Resume-Check, Resume Guide, Cover Letter Builder, Cover Letter Tips, My Perfect Resume, Resume Review, Resume Writing, Resume Services, Search Jobs), create a profile, create a resume, search for or purchase services, or otherwise engage with our Site, you must provide certain information such as a username and a valid email address. You must also provide payment information such as credit or debit card information, name and billing address in order to purchase services. This information is only associated with your account after you have signed in as a registered user.</p>

<p>b)  <strong>Information to Respond to Your Requests:</strong> You may give us contact information so we can respond to your questions and requests, as well as responding to your requests to send you newsletters and other communications. Details of how you can opt-out of receiving communications from us are detailed in the section headed <a href="#policySection5">Accessing, Reviewing, and Changing Your Personal Information</a></p>

<p>c)  <strong>Social Media Information:</strong> We offer sign-on services that allow you to use third-party login credentials to access the Site. We also offer services that allow you to share information with third-party websites such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, and others. Unless otherwise prohibited by those third-party websites, when you link your account or engage with our Site through third-party sites,  we may collect certain information stored on those sites such as your social networking credentials, your public profile, friend list, people you follow or who follow you, pictures, your e-mail address, birthday, work history, education history, interests, current city, religious and political views, website, personal description, and likes, and your friends’ birthdays, education histories, personal descriptions and likes.</p>

<p>d) <strong>User Interaction Information:</strong> We can also receive other information (e.g., content viewed and information about the advertisements within the content you have been shown or have clicked on, etc.) from your interaction with our Site. You agree that we can share your interaction information with, or obtain information about your interaction from, analytics providers, advertising partners, third-party partners, and social media sites for two years or until you withdraw your consent for the purpose of providing or improving our services.

Information that can be passed to analytics providers and advertising partners can be via cookies and tracking technologies. Please see our <a href="/information/cookie-tracking-policy.aspx">Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy</a> for information, including your choices in relation to some of these technologies.</p>

<p>e)  <strong>Information from other Sources:</strong> The information we collect can be combined with publicly available information.</p>

<p>f)  <strong>Mobile Information:</strong> By agreeing to this Policy you consent that we may collect additional information from you if you access our Site through a mobile device (e.g. your unique device identifier, device’s operating system, mobile carrier, location or GPS/geo-location, mobile number, your text messages, emails or email address, user name, contacts/address book, financial or payment information, web browsing history, photos, your phone’s name, passwords, political interests, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs, trade union membership).</p>

We automatically collect information from location storage associated with your web browser, including your browsing behavior for career searching activity. We can also automatically record your interactions with certain webpages by accessing local storage associated with your web browser. Each browser extension was made to automatically interact with third-party websites, so we can also collect some information about you when you visit those websites including, clickstream data, operating system being used, the URL of the site you have come from and move to after your visit, data relating to your activities on third party websites (including IP addresses and URLs) via tracking technologies (such as cookies and measurement software), the date and time of your visit and your server's IP address, the geo-location of your device, and the type of payment you use. We collect this information for statistical purposes to find out how our website and each browser extension is being used. We use this information to evaluate and, hopefully, improve your experience. As an example, when you visit a webpage that supports the autofill function, we can record metadata generated by your web browser that identifies one or more autofill fields that you interact with. In this example, we can also access local storage associated with your web browser to determine information which can be or has been entered into an autofill field. We use your information to facilitate your completion of job applications across the internet, on our websites and third-party websites and to provide advertising and/or other content that we believe can be of interest to you based upon your browsing behavior on the internet.</p>

We are not required to inform you or to obtain your consent to tracking technologies that are operationally necessary.</p>

<p>b) <strong>Performance-Related:</strong> We can use cookies or other tracking technologies to assess the performance of the online services, including as part of our analytic practices to improve the content offered through the online services. For example, as set forth in detail in our <a href="/information/cookie-tracking-policy.aspx">Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy</a>, we use <a href="/information/cookie-tracking-policy.aspx#GoogleAnalytics">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="https://www.inspectlet.com">Inspectlet</a> to perform site analytics.</p>

<p>c) <strong>Functionality-Related:</strong> We can use tracking technologies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Site before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you have the greatest interest.</p>

<p>d) <strong>Targeting-Related:</strong> We can use tracking technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on our online service and third-party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content as well as track the content you access (including video viewing). Further information on this, and your <a href="/information/cookie-tracking-policy.aspx#CTCookiesSection4">opt-out choices</a>, is in the “Your Choices” section above.</p>

<p>We can also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and/or connection information. During some visits we can use software tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page interaction information.</p>

<p>Tracking technologies, such as cookies, are mainly alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. When you visit the Site, we and our business partners can use tracking technologies to enhance your online experience or customize our offerings. For example, some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site, while others are used to enable a faster login process. A few additional important things you should know about our use of tracking technologies (cookies):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We can offer certain features that are available only through the use of tracking technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. We use both session and persistent tracking technologies. Tracking technologies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). You may be able to decline tracking technologies if your browser permits, although doing so can interfere with your use of the Site. Refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling tracking technologies such as cookies.</p></li>
<li><p>We encode and protect the tracking technologies that Provider sets, so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You can encounter tracking technologies from our third-party service providers, that we have allowed on our Site that assist us with various aspects of our Site operations and services, such as Google Analytics.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also encounter tracking technologies from third parties on certain pages of the websites that we do not control and have not authorized. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there can be a cookie placed by that web page).</p></li>
<li><p>Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third-party service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about the use of cookies and similar technologies on our Site please review this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/information/cookie-tracking-policy.aspx#CTCookiesSection4">Tracking Technologies Policy</a>.</p>
