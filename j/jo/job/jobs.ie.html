    <p>USES MADE OF THE INFORMATION </p>
    <p>Jobs.ie’s Customers post information about employment, consultant or contractor vacancies on the Website, whether on their own behalf or, if a recruitment or consultancy, on behalf of third parties (“Job Specifications”). These Job Specifications can then be accessed and read by other users of the Website. You can search for registered Customers of the Website, whether they are direct employers or agencies. Jobs.ie does not vet or monitor the Job Specifications in terms of their terms and conditions applicable to the use of your personal information.</p>
    <p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <ul>
            <li>to provide registered Customers of the Website with the information that you submit to the Website in response to a Job Specification. Submission of information by you to a particular Job Specification is treated by us to be permission to forward to that information to the Customer or Customers that have posted that Job Specification only;</li>
            <li>if you choose to be a registered user of the Website you may also choose to display your details to registered Jobs.ie employers. We will display details of the personal information about you that you submit to the Website for registered Customers of the Website, so that Customers are able to evaluate whether you are a suitable candidate for a vacant position (whether or not a Job Specification); you will be able to control the type of personal information about you which will be displayed in this way through your user account;</li>
            <li>as a registered user of the Website you may opt to receive Job Alerts by email. To facilitate your ease of use of the Website across multiple devices, Job Alerts by email include a personalised link which will recognize you when you visit the Website by clicking on a link in the email. This makes it easy for you to apply for jobs as your name, email address, and link to your last used CV will automatically be populated in the Job application form. As Job Alert emails are personalised to you, it is important that you do not share these email links with other people or post them on social media. You are responsible for maintaining the security of these personal Job Alert email links. Sharing personalised Job Alerts could result in a somebody inadvertently applying for a job in your name.
                <br><br>Your personal account details (personal profile, saved CVs, cover letters, application history, Job Alert details) are not accessible via personalised Job Alert email links. They can only be accessed by entering your user name and password.</li>
            <li>to ensure that content from the Website is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;</li>
            <li>to provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes;</li>
            <li>to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so; and</li>
            <li>to notify you about changes to our service. </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>We may also use your email address to send you updates or news regarding the Website or a Jobs.ie Service, but you may choose not to receive emails of this type by accessing the "Your Account" page of the Website and updating your notification settings.
