<p><b>Overview</b> </p>
<p>Jobs.ie has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to 
privacy. The following outlines this commitment to users as we want to be able 
to provide everyone with a user experience that is safe and secure. Jobs.ie 
wants to ensure, to our best efforts, that any information you give us remains 
private and are used only for the purposes outlined in this Policy. </p>
<p>By using the Jobs.ie website, it is understood that you agree with the terms 
of this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>A user can access our website, Jobs.ie (the 'site') and utilise many of our 
services without providing any information to us at all. Nor do we follow a 
user's browsing path outside of our site. We do develop summary - not individual 
- reports for our recruiters and advertisers. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Jobs.ie owned website and domain. <br>
The Jobs.ie website may provide links to third-party websites for your 
convenience. If you access these links, you will leave the Jobs.ie website. 
Jobs.ie does not control these sites or their privacy practices. Any exchange of 
information with unrelated third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy. 
We encourage all users to review the Privacy Policy/statement of any third party 
before submitting personal information. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Site Security</b> <br>
Jobs.ie is committed to protecting the information you provide us with. To 
prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of information under our control , 
Jobs.ie has appropriate security management systems in place to safeguard the 
information we collect. </p>
<p>Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Virus Scanners are used on all parts of 
the Jobs.ie website. Encryption during transmission is also used on sections of 
the site where security is particularly important. </p>
<p>While Jobs.ie makes every effort to protect all personal information, we 
recognise that unfortunately no data transmission over the Internet can be 
guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result Jobs.ie cannot ensure or warrant the 
security of any information you transmit to us, you do so at your own risk. </p>
<p><b>Personal Information</b> <br>
There are areas of the Jobs.ie website where you can request information, 
subscribe to marketing materials, enter competitions, register yourself for our 
online services, request customer support or apply for a job within our 
organisation. This can involve registering your personal information such as; 
your name, e-mail address, password, contact details, educational and employment 
background, and job interest information. The information collected is solely 
for the purpose of personalising your user experience and for delivering the 
service(s) that you have signed up for. Once you choose to provide Jobs.ie with 
personal information, you can be certain that it will only be used to support 
your relationship with us. </p>
<p><b>Application Information</b> <br>
Jobs.ie operates as a platform for jobseekers and recruiters with the tools to 
enable you to choose the companies and recruitment agencies you would like to 
speak to when you wish to do so. </p>
<p>When you make an online application on Jobs.ie your personal information / CV 
application is received directly by the recruiter. By forwarding your 
information to that recruiter for the vacancy advertised Jobs.ie understands 
that it is your decision to disclose this information to a third party and 
acknowledge that the third party is not covered by the Jobs.ie Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p><b>Client Profiles</b> <br>
Jobs.ie vacancy advertising clients are given the option to have a profile page 
on site. This includes information related to their company such as; company 
logo, contact details, company profile, web address and related links. This 
information is disclosed for your convenience and information, however if you 
access some of the links and web addresses disclosed on these pages, you will 
leave the Jobs.ie website. </p>
<p>Some Jobs.ie clients are advertised on site under featured employer member 
pages; which means Jobs.ie host a number of their web pages on our server to 
provide users with an experience similar to the recruiters own website. </p>
<p><b>Jobs by Email</b> <br>
The Jobs by eMail Alert service matches a jobseeker's requirements for 
employment with the profile of vacancies advertised on our site. For jobseekers 
who subscribe to this service, you receive an email listing of those jobs which 
match the criteria you have registered. You can unsubscribe from this service at 
any time. </p>
<p><b>CVs</b> <br>
Jobseekers may decide to register their CV in our database. Users can choose to 
make their CV searchable for inclusion in our CV database product. This product 
allows your CV to be viewed by recruiters who have subscribed to this service. 
It also means that you can attach your CV to your online job application(s). </p>
<p>We endeavor to grant access to the CV database only to recruiters who agree 
to abide by our <a href="TermsOfUse.html">Terms and Conditions</a>. However, should a third party gain access 
to your CV by evading our security measures, we cannot be held responsible. </p>
<p>You may remove your CV from our database at any time. However, recruiters who 
have already accessed your CV may have kept a copy of it in their own files. 
Please note that we cannot be held responsible for the retention, use, or 
privacy of your CV in these instances.<br>
</p>
<p>You may review, correct, update or change your <b>MyJobsie</b> account 
profile information or CV at any time. Simply log into your Jobs.ie account, go 
to your Account Profile or CV, review your account information or CV and, if you 
wish, edit it with the options provided. You may also delete your CV through 
this method.<br>
If you wish to delete your <b>MyJobsie</b> account profile information at any 
time, please contact us at <a href="mailto:jobseekers@jobs.ie">
jobseekers@jobs.ie</a>. An email will be sent to you to confirm that your 
information has been deleted (save for an archival copy which is not accessible 
by you or third parties on the Internet). The archival copy is retained 
indefinitely for audit and record purposes.<br>
If you wish to revoke your consent to our Privacy Statement, please contact us 
at at <a href="mailto:jobseekers@jobs.ie">jobseekers@jobs.ie</a>. However, 
please note that if you do withdraw your consent, you may not be able to use the
