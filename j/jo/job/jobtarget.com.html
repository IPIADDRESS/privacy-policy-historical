	<h2>JobTarget Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>JobTarget maintains a great respect for the privacy and security of our users.  We recognize that the reason we can remain in business is because of you.  Therefore we will do nothing to jeopardize your trust and loyalty.</p>
	<p>This Privacy Policy outlines the terms under which JobTarget collects and uses your information on our web sites.  By using our services, you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy, and the way in which JobTarget uses and discloses your information.  JobTarget hosts and manages over 1,000 career web sites on behalf of our Partners.  If you visit a career site that is powered by JobTarget, you may also see our Partner’s logos, trademarks, and proprietary trade documentation on that web site.  We strongly recommend that you also review our Partner’s Privacy Policy before using the web site.  If you disagree with the way we collect, process and display personal and non–personal information on our web sites, we recommend that you do not use them.  Although we make every effort to keep information confidential in accordance with the functionality of our web sites, JobTarget cannot and does not guarantee the security, confidentiality, or privacy of any information or communication that you submit to us.  If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@jobtarget.com">privacy@jobtarget.com</a>.</p>

	<h3>Information Collected by JobTarget</h3>
	<p>Our web sites collect information from visitors, including job seekers, employers, recruiters and advertising agencies ("users").  You are not required to give us personal information to perform job searches or to view content on most of our web sites.  Some Partners may require membership to their organization before granting access to their career-sites.  JobTarget will however collect personal information about you when you choose to create a job seeker or employer profile, create a new account, and/or upload your resume.  Some examples of personal information that we collect include: your name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, contact information, IP address, billing information, profession, work experience, and information about third parties, such as contacts or references that you provide to us.</p>
	<p>We may also collect behavioral information regarding how you use our sites and the areas of our site that you visit to better serve you in the future.</p>
	<p>JobTarget may ask you for your credit card or bank information in order to process payment for a transaction.  We will not provide this information to any third party unless it is used to complete a transaction for an item you purchased from that third party via our web sites.  JobTarget will not ask you for your social security number, drivers license information, marital status, hair color, eye color, etc.  You should not provide your credit card, bank, or any of the above personal information to ANY prospective employers or recruiters that you encounter on our web sites.  Please make sure that you keep your username and password confidential.</p>
	<p>All personal data will be processed and stored by JobTarget in the United States.  United States laws regarding processing of personal data may be less stringent than the laws in your jurisdiction.</p>

	<h3>How Information is Used by JobTarget</h3>
	<p>JobTarget collects personal and non-personal information to perform the service of matching job seekers up with potential employers.  Our goal is to provide a beneficial and positive experience for all parties using our services.  By utilizing our services, you have agreed to allow us to use your information, subject to local law, in the following manner: To create a job seeker profile for you based on information you have provided to us; To provide information about you to employers and recruiters at your request; To create an employer profile based on the information you have provided us; To provide information about you and your recruitment advertisements to job seekers at your request; If an employer uses JobTarget’s technology to post an advertisement to a third party job board, that employer's contact information may be shared with the operator of that third party; To contact you regarding changes to your profile, service updates, products and services you may be interested in, surveys, sweepstakes, and various other communications regarding our products and services.  We do not sell your personal information to anyone for any reason without your consent.  You may elect to opt out of any communications sent to you at any time.</p>
	<p>Job seekers may elect to have their profile and contact information kept private at any time by logging in and changing the setting of their profile.  You may request that we change the settings of your profile for you by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@jobtarget.com">support@jobtarget.com</a>.</p>
	<p>JobTarget’s career center sites are not all the same.  Some sites may have an anonymous resume bank (employers can see your non-personal information, but not your personal information until you respond to them), whereas other sites may have a public resume bank (employers can see your personal and non-personal information).  Job seekers should familiarize themselves with that particular site’s services and functionality before activating their resume, so they are aware of what information will be made public.</p>
	<p>If you use our service to build or post a resume in our database, you will be providing us with personal data that will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy.  Your resume should not contain sensitive personal information relating to your:</p>
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman; margin: 8px 0 8px 55px;">
		<li>racial or ethnic origin,</li>
		<li>political beliefs,</li>
		<li>philosophical or religious beliefs,</li>
		<li>membership of a trade union or political party,</li>
		<li>physical or mental health or genetic makeup,</li>
		<li>addictions, sexual life,</li>
		<li>the commission of criminal offences or proceedings and associated penalties or fines, or </li>
		<li>any Social Security Number or national identification number, unless otherwise required by law.</li> 
	</ol>
		
	<p>If your resume does contain such data then you agree that we may retain this information and use it in accordance with this Policy.</p>
	<p>JobTarget does not disclose personal data to third parties without your consent.  If you select a product or service on our site that is offered by one of our affiliates, you may be redirected to that affiliate’s web site, and some of your personal information may be provided to that affiliate in order to assist them with the transaction.  Please be aware that our Affiliates may use your information consistent with their own Privacy Policy, which may be inconsistent with our Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>JobTarget may be required to disclose your personal information to law enforcement officials to cooperate with the law.  This disclosure would be to protect the interests of JobTarget and its users.</p>
