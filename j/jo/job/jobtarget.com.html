                <h2>Privacy Certification</h2>

                <p><i>Department of Commerce U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor</i></p>

                <p>JobTarget self-certifies its compliance with the U.S. - E.U.  Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the European Union member countries.

                <p><em>Information you provide to us</em></p>

                <p>Visitors to our website remain anonymous unless they elect to register an account on our website or request information from JobTarget. We require certain personal information to register accounts as well as to respond to your inquiries about our website, products and services. This information includes items such as your name, email address, phone number, and physical address. We may also collect sensitive information such as credit card number and cvc code to fulfill payment for products and services purchased on the website.</p>

                <p><em>Information we collect from visitors to our website</em></p>
            
                <p>We collect anonymous information from visitors to our website to help us understand the usage patterns of our website, and to provide better customer service.  Information collected in this manner is provided automatically by your system and the systems that you use to connect to our website.  For example, we may keep track of what time people visit our website, how long they stay on the website, and what sections they visit.  We use this information to better tailor our website for our visitors and their usage patterns, as well as to gauge performance and other measures of the website.</p>

                <p><em>Information collected when you interact with our technology</em></p>

                <p>JobTarget builds technology that is designed to provide analytical data and statistics to employers that post recruitment advertisements through JobTarget's distribution channels. JobTarget acts as an agent of the employer by collecting user personal and non-personal information during the job application process. That means you may interact indirectly with JobTarget technology when you apply for a job online, for example.</p>

                <p>JobTarget may collect, retain, use and pass along data and statistics to our customers.  Our technology collects information from visitors, including job seekers, employers, recruiters, and advertising agencies to track the performance of job postings delivered through our platform.</p>

                <h2>How JobTarget Uses Information We Collect</h2>

                <p><em>Connecting Job Seekers and Employers</em></p>

                <p><em>Providing Data to Employers</em></p>

                <p>JobTarget uses personal and non-personal data to conduct various measures of job posting effectiveness, accuracy, posting locations, business intelligence regarding the placement of job advertisements, the content of job advertisements, and the conversion of users from viewing a job advertisement to submitting a completed job application for an open position. This information may be analyzed and used to generate statistics and to determine use patterns and effective recruitment advertising strategies.  Our goal is to provide a beneficial and positive experience for all parties using our services by developing deep insight into the process of matching jobseekers with employers through the right job advertisements.</p>

                <p><em>When and How we Disclose Information</em></p>

                <p>JobTarget generates its revenue from facilitating the flow of information between and among employers and jobseekers, but JobTarget does not knowingly provide personal information to any party for any purposes unrelated to recruitment.

                <p>If you are an employer who uses JobTarget's technology to post an advertisement to a third party job listing site, your contact information may be shared with the operator of that third party.</p>

                <p>JobTarget may disclose your personal information to, and in cooperation with, law enforcement officials.</p>

                <h2>Privacy-Related Technology</h2>

                <p><em>Security Technology</em>

                </p><p>JobTarget employs industry accepted standards in protecting your personal information while on our website.  JobTarget uses 128 bit SSL encryption to manage our payment processing. JobTarget is compliant with the PCI scan validation requirement.</p>

                <p>JobTarget will take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized or inappropriate use by third parties.

Our users assume all responsibility and risk for their use of our website and/or services or their use of our customers' systems.</p>

                <p><em>Cookies, Web Beacons and LSOs / Flash Cookies</em></p>

                <p>JobTarget uses cookies for your convenience and security. Cookies are text files stored on your computer. The cookies remember information that you've already typed in our web site fields, among other things, so you don't have to enter them again.

                <p>We may also apply the use of web beacons in our email communications, job listings, and website from time to time. A web beacon is a one pixel by one pixel image embedded within a web page for page view tracking purposes.  Although this list is not exhaustive, your actions may be tracked by a web beacon when you (a) view a job on a job board or website; (b) click on an apply link in an online job posting; (c) visit an employer's applicant tracking system (ATS) online; (d) create a job seeker account or request email job alerts; or (e) submit a resume or application to an employer online.</p>

                <p>Like most other websites, we also make use of log files which include users IP address, referring URL and pages viewed within a session.</p>

Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, use flash cookies to collect and store information.</p>

                <p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data, as well as how that data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove flash cookies.

                <p><em>Proxy Servers</em></p>

                <p>JobTarget may use proxy servers to collect information from job seekers during the application process. When a job seeker clicks the "Apply Here" link in a job description, they are redirected to the employer's application page via JobTarget's proxy server. The proxy server collects personal and non-personal information on behalf of the employer. Personal information may include profession, work history, contacts and references, and other information you type into your browser during that process.</p>

                <p><em>Third Party Cookies &amp; Web Beacons</em></p>

                <p>Third parties who advertise on our website may employ the use of cookies and web beacons to track the effectiveness of their advertisements. We have no access to these third party cookies.</p>

                <p>We may also employ the services of third parties in tracking aggregated statistical data about our website. This information is used for statistical purposes and these third parties may also employ the use of cookies and web beacons in providing this service to us.</p>

                <p><em>Targeted Advertising</em></p>

                <p>We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.</p>

                <p><em>Do Not Track (DNT) Signals</em></p>
            
                <p>In certain circumstances we may elect not to respond to a browser's Do Not Track signal.</p>

                <h2>Retention of Personal Information</h2>

                <p>Unless you expressly direct us not to or we are obligated not to by applicable law, JobTarget may retain your personal information indefinitely, as JobTarget cannot assume that an employer or jobseeker is no longer interested in JobTarget's services.  JobTarget may also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p>
