</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
JobsByRef.com uses software tags called "cookies" to identify Users when they visit our website.
Cookies are used to remember user preferences and maximize performance of our services. The information
we collect with cookies is not sold, rented, or shared with any outside parties.
Users who disable their Web browser's ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our
Website but will not be able to successfully use our Service.
</p>
<p>
We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you
close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.
Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
experience on our site.
</p>
<p>
We also use cookies to analyze how visitors, in the aggregate, use our website, in
order to make our website as useful as possible for them. We do not use cookies to collect
or store personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by JobsByRef.com only and does not cover
the use of cookies by any advertisers.
</p>
<p>
<b>Third Party Cookies:</b> We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze
non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our
website to help us administer our website and improve its quality. Such third parties may
use cookies to help track visitor behavior. Such cookies will not be used to associate
individual website visitors to any personally identifiable information. All data collected by
such third parties on behalf of JobsByRef.com is used only to provide us with information on
site usage and is not shared with any other third parties.
</p>

<h3>Web Beacons/Web Bugs</h3>
<p>
JobsByRef.com may include a file, called a web beacon, that allows the website to count
users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.
</p>
<p>
From time to time we will/may allow other companies, and ad networks, to serve advertisements
to JobsByRef.com users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology
vendors and research firms. JobsByRef.com may "target" some ads to users that fit a certain
general profile. JobsByRef.com does NOT use personally identifiable information to target ads.
</p>
<p>
To deliver these ads properly, a web beacon is usually used, from these
ad networks within pages served by JobsByRef.com so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated
auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit
other websites.
</p>
<p>
Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's
servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a
web page from their site.
</p>
<p>
These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as
a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. JobsByRef.com never provides personally identifiable information
to any advertiser nor any third party.
