				<h3>GENERAL</h3> <p>VHMnetwork LLC (“Company”) respects the privacy of its users whether they  use our website located at www.JobDiagnosis.com (“Website”) to  participate in career diagnostic and information services as well as to take  advantage of services and product offerings or simply to view the Website. The  following Company privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to inform you,  as a user of the Website, about the types of information that Company may  gather about or collect from you in connection with your use of the Website. It  also is intended to explain the conditions under which Company uses and  discloses that information, and your rights in relation to that information.  Changes to this Privacy Policy are discussed at the end of this document. Each  time you use the Website, however, the current version of this Privacy Policy  will apply. Accordingly, each time you use the Website you should check the  date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the beginning of this document)  and review any changes since the last time you used the Website. &nbsp;<br>   Our Website is hosted in the United States of America and is subject to U.S.  state and federal law. If you are accessing our Website from other  jurisdictions, please be advised that you are transferring your personal  information to us in the United States, and by using our Website, you consent  to that transfer and to abide by the applicable laws of applicable states and  U.S. federal law concerning your use of the Website and your agreements with us.  Any persons accessing our Website from any jurisdiction with laws or  regulations governing the use of the Internet, including personal data  collection, use and disclosure different from those of the jurisdictions  mentioned above may only use the Website in a manner lawful in their  jurisdiction. If your use of our Website would be unlawful in your  jurisdiction, please do not use the Website.</p> <p><strong>BY  REGISTERING WITH OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF  YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></p> <p> As used in this Privacy Policy, “Non-Personally-Identifying Information” is  information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly  associated with a specific person. “Personally-Identifying Information,” by  contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more,  can be directly associated with a specific person.&nbsp;</p> <p>   <strong>CHILDREN</strong> <br>   The Website is not intended for children under 13 years of age.  Company does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p> <p><br>   <strong>COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF  PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</strong> <br>   <strong><em>Website Registration</em></strong> <br>   As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is  information that can be directly associated with a specific person. Company  collects a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about Website  users. Much of the Personally-Identifying Information collected by Company  about users is information provided by users themselves at the time they sign  up to use the Company Services. That information may include each user’s name,  address, e-mail address, and telephone number, and, if you transact business  with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card  number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may  request information about your interests and activities, your gender, age, date  of birth, hometown and other demographic information or your username, and  other relevant information as determined by Company from time to time. Users of  the Website are under no obligation to provide Company with  Personally-Identifying Information of any kind, with the caveat that a user’s  refusal to do so may prevent the user from using certain Website features.&nbsp;<strong>By providing  a telephone number users agree and specifically thereby request that we, our  partners, associates and/or certain approved third parties may contact you via  such telephone number whether or not such number may be included in any State,  Federal or other Do Not Call Registry.</strong> </p> <p> During the registration process you will be directed through a  number of third party websites displaying advertisements for that may be of  interest to you. If you select "Yes" on any of these advertisements  or choose to complete the forms provided, you will be asked to submit  Personally-Identifying Information. On behalf of certain advertisers, we may  request sensitive personal information such as your credit card number or  social security number. In all cases, when you click on the submit button we will  securely transfer your personal information to the third-party advertiser you  selected. We will not use the information that you submit for transfer to a  third-party advertiser for our own purposes; nor will we retain or disclose it.  You may be prompted by some advertisers to answer additional questions. These  pages may be "co-branded" or "framed." This means that they  may appear to be part of our Website because they have a JobDiagnosis.com  look and feel, but they are, in fact, part of the advertiser's site.<br>   All framed pages contain the following disclaimer at the bottom  of the page: "*By submitting the form above I agree to provide this  information to the advertiser and to be contacted by this advertiser  directly." On these framed pages, we do not collect any of the additional  information you submit; the advertiser does, and it does not share this  information with us. The advertiser uses your information to deliver additional  information to you about its particular product or service and perhaps for  other purposes. Its collection and use of your information is subject to its  own privacy policy.</p> <p>  <strong><em>Company Communications</em></strong> <br>   We and our affiliates may use your contact information to send  you marketing communications via email, telephone, direct mail or otherwise  regarding services or products offered by Company and its partners that we  think you may find valuable. We may also send you service-related announcements  from time to time through the general operation of the service. Generally, you  may opt out of such communications by following the instructions in emails for  unsubscribing, by editing your account details and preferences, &nbsp;or by  contacting us as provided below, though we reserve the right to send you  notices about your account even if you opt out of all marketing communications.</p> <p>  <strong><em>Company Disclosures</em></strong> <br>   By using the Company Services and accessing the Website, which  are all provided as a free service, you consent to Company using and disclosing  your Personally-Identifying Information under the following circumstances:</p> <ul>   <li><strong>Marketing  Communications</strong>. Company may contact  users about products and services that Company believes may be of interest to  users using all contact information that you provide to Company. Company may  also provide users’ email information, telephone numbers, mailing addresses,  and other contact information to third parties (including providers of direct  marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data  enhancement, suppression and validation, email marketing, and telemarketing),  so that those third parties may directly contact users about additional  products and services. If a user wishes to opt out of receiving marketing  materials from Company or having their contact information provided to third  parties at any time after registration, they may do so by going to their  account settings or contacting us using the contact information found below.  Even after opting-out, a user may continue to receive marketing emails,  telephone calls, direct mail from third parties to whom Company already has  provided the user’s contact information. Users will be responsible for directly  contacting such third parties to request cessation of further marketing  contacts.</li>   <li><strong>Business  Partners:&nbsp;</strong>When you make  purchases or otherwise engage in promotions offered through our Website or our  services, we may share Personally-Identifying Information with the businesses  with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions,  contests and/or sweepstakes. When you elect to engage in a particular  merchant's offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and  other information to that merchant. Company does not request or collect  sensitive financial or sensitive information such as your credit card number,  bank account information or social security number in order to register with  our Website. However, when you choose to participate in a promotion with our  partners, this sensitive information may be requested by the partner and  therefore collected by Company for the sole purpose of providing this  information to the partner. Company does not store or use this information for  any other purpose.</li>   <li><strong>Direct Mail Partners.</strong>&nbsp;From time to time we may share our  postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services that may be of  interest to you. If you prefer not to receive mailings from these providers,  you may opt out by going to your account settings or contacting us as provided  below.</li>   <li><strong>Third Party Service  Providers</strong>. We may share your  Personally-Identifying Information, which may include your name and contact  information (including email address) with our authorized service providers  that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include  fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing  business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and  supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through  our Website. We may also share your name, contact information and credit card  information with our authorized service providers who process credit card  payments. These service providers may have access to personal information  needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such  information for any other purpose.</li>   <li>&nbsp;<strong>By Law or to Protect  Rights</strong>. When we believe  disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent,  or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other  wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our Company,  our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate  with law enforcement; or to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or  policies, in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court  order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government  agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal  claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive  any legal objection or right available to us.</li>   <li><strong>Business Transfers;  Bankruptcy</strong>. Company reserves the  right to transfer all Personally-Identifying Information in its possession to a  successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or  other sale of all or a portion of Company’s assets. Other than to the extent  ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all  transferred Personally-Identifying Information will be subject to this Privacy  Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new privacy  policy and are given an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of it.  Personally-Identifying Information submitted or collected after a transfer,  however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor  organization.</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Changing Personally-Identifying Information;  Account Termination&nbsp;</em></strong><br>   You may at any time review and change your Personally-Identifying Information  through your account settings or by contacting us as provided below. Upon your  request, we will deactivate or delete your account and contact information from  our active databases. Such information will be deactivated or deleted as soon  as practicable based on your account activity and accordance with our  deactivation policy and applicable law. To make this request, please contact us  as provided below. We will retain in our files some personal information to  prevent fraud, to troubleshoot problems, to assist with any investigations, to  enforce our Terms of Use and to comply with legal requirements as is permitted  by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all your personal information  will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.  Additionally, we keep a history of changed information to investigate suspected  fraud with your account.&nbsp;</p> <p>   <strong><em>General  Use</em></strong> <br>   We use the Personally-Identifiable Information in the file we  maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past  activities on the Website to: deliver the products and services that you have  requested, manage your account and provide you with customer support,  communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices  about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us, our  affiliate companies or other third parties, develop and display content and  advertising tailored to your interests on our Website and other sites, resolve  disputes, troubleshoot problems, measure consumer interest in our services,  reward you for the ads you watch, inform you of updates, customize your  experience, detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal  activity, enforce our Terms of Use, and as otherwise described to you at the  time of collection. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify  problems. In particular, we may examine your Personally-Identifiable  Information to identify users using multiple user IDs or aliases. We may  compare and review your Personally-Identifying Information for accuracy and to  detect errors and omissions. We may use financial information or payment method  to process payment for any purchases made on our Website, enroll you in the  discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to participate, to  protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as  needed to manage our business.</p> <p><strong><em>Use of Data Collected </em></strong> <br>We use your personal, demographic and profile data to enhance your experience at our site and to enable us to present content we think you might be interested in. We use your contact information to send you information about our company and promotional material from our partners. We may also use your personal, demographic and profile data to improve our site, for statistical analysis, for marketing and promotional purposes, and for editorial or feedback purposes for our advertisers. Information collected by us may be added to our databases and used for future telemarketing, SMS text-messaging, e-mails or postal mailings regarding site updates, new products and services, upcoming events, and/or status of orders placed online. By using this site, you agree that you may be contacted in any manner contemplated in this section even if your number is found on a do not call registry, in-house list or similar registry. </p> <p><strong><em>Opt-out rights</em></strong> <br>You may remove your information from our database. If you remove your information from our database it will no longer be used by us for secondary purposes, disclosed to third parties, or used by us or third parties to send promotional correspondence to you. You may remove your information by  sending  "STOP", "END", "QUIT" to the SMS text message you have received.</p> <p>  <strong>CONTESTS, GIVEAWAYS AND SURVEYS.</strong> <br>   From time to time, Company may offer Website users the  opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways and other promotions. Any  information submitted in connection with such activities will be treated in  accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, Company may also ask  Website users to participate in surveys designed to help Company improve the  Website. Any Personally-Identifying Information provided to Company in  connection with any survey will be used only in relation to that survey, and  will be disclosed to third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy only in  non-personally-identifying, aggregated form.</p> <p><strong><em>EMAIL TO FRIENDS FEATURE AND REFERRAL PROGRAM</em></strong> <br>   Company offers users the ability to send friends emails about  the Website. If users choose to use this feature, be assured that Company only  uses friends’ email addresses on a one-time basis to send the requested email.</p> <p>  <strong>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THIRD  PARTIES&nbsp;GENERALLY</strong> <br>   Company contractually prohibits its contractors, affiliates,  vendors and suppliers from disclosing Personally-Identifying Information  received from Company, other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Third  parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy, however, with  respect to Personally-Identifying Information that users provide directly to  those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. Company  neither owns nor controls the third-party websites accessible through the  Website. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to or  gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third-party,  whether by means of a link on the Website or otherwise, and before providing  any Personally-Identifying Information to any third party, users should inform  themselves of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party  responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in  those users’ discretion, protect their privacy.</p> <p>  <strong>GATHERING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF  NON-PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</strong> <br>   <strong><em>Users of the Website Generally</em></strong> <br>   Like most website operators, Company gathers from users of the  Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web browsers,  depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the  user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, and  the locations of the Web pages the user views right before arriving at, while  navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Company analyzes  Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website to  help Company better understand how the Website is being used.
