      <p><strong>BY REGISTERING WITH OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT    TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS    DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></p>
      <p>As used in this Privacy Policy,    “Non-Personally-Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid    of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific    person. “Personally-Identifying Information,” by contrast, is information    such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly    associated with a specific person.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>CHILDREN</strong></p>
      <p>The Website is not intended for children under 13 years of    age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
      <p><strong>COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF    PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</strong></p>
      <p><strong><em>Website Registration</em></strong></p>
      <p>As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is    information that can be directly associated with a specific person. We collect    a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about Website users.    Much of the Personally-Identifying Information coll<a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack">e</a>cted    by us about users is information provided by users themselves at the time    they sign up to use the Company Services. That information may include each    user’s name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. &nbsp;We also may request information about your    interests and activities, your gender, hometown and other demographic    information or your username, and other relevant information as determined by    us from time to time. Users of the Website are under no obligation to provide    us with Personally-Identifying Information of any kind, with the caveat that    a user’s refusal to do so may prevent the user from using certain Website    features.&nbsp;<strong>By providing a telephone number users agree and    specifically thereby request that we, our partners, associates and/or certain    approved third parties may contact you via such telephone number whether or    not such number may be included in any State, Federal or other Do Not Call    Registry.</strong></p>
      <p>During the registration process you will be directed    through a number of third party websites displaying advertisements for that    may be of interest to you. If you select "Yes" on any of these    advertisements or choose to complete the forms provided, you will be asked to    submit Personally-Identifying Information. In all cases, when you click on    the submit button we will securely transfer your personal information to the    third-party advertiser you selected. We will not use the information that you    submit for transfer to a third-party advertiser for our own purposes; nor    will we retain or disclose it. You may be prompted by some advertisers to    answer additional questions. These pages may be "co-branded" or    "framed." This means that they may appear to be part of our Website    because they have a JobDiagnosis.com look and feel, but they are, in fact,    part of the advertiser's site.</p>
      <p>All framed pages contain the following disclaimer at the    bottom of the page: "*By submitting the form above I agree to provide    this information to the advertiser and to be contacted by this advertiser    directly." On these framed pages, we do not collect any of the    additional information you submit; the advertiser does, and it does not share    this information with us. The advertiser uses your information to deliver    additional information to you about its particular product or service and    perhaps for other purposes. Its collection and use of your information is    subject to its own privacy policy.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Communications</em></strong></p>
      <p>We and our affiliates may use your contact information to    send you marketing communications via email, telephone, direct mail or    otherwise regarding services or products offered by us and our partners that    we think you may find valuable. We may also send you service-related    announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service.    Generally, you may opt out of such communications by following the    instructions in emails for unsubscribing, by editing your account details and    preferences, &nbsp;or by contacting us as provided below, though we reserve    the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all    marketing communications.&nbsp; To no longer    receive these service-related announcements you would have to deactivate your    account by logging in and clicking the “Cancel Account” button the My Info    tab.&nbsp; You can also contact

      <p><strong><em>Users of the Website Generally</em></strong></p>
      <p>Like most website operators, Company gathers from users of    the Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web    browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information    includes the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and    browser type, and the locations of the Web pages the user views right before    arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. We analyze    Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website to    help us<s> </s>better understand how the Website is being used. By    identifying patterns and trends in usage, we are able to better design the    Website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease of    use. From time to time, we may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying    Information gathered from Website users in the aggregate, such as by    publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.</p>
      <p>We may also periodically obtain both    Personally-Identifying Information and Non-Personally-Identifying Information    about you from other Company-affiliated businesses, business partners,    contractors and other third parties and add it to our account information or    other information we have collected. Examples of information that we may    receive include: updated address information, purchase history, and    additional demographic information.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Web Cookies</em></strong></p>
      <p>A “Web Cookie” is a string of information that a website    stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the    website each time the user submits a query to the site.
