<p class="frameheader">Privacy Policy for All Sweepstakes and Contests and Requests of Free Information</p>
<p>Welcome to our website, owned and produced by VHMnetwork LLC its subsidiary and affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as "VHMnetwork"). All products and services offered by VHMnetwork is subject to this PRIVACY POLICY. </p>
<p class="pagenav_next">What Information We Collect/How We Use It </p>
<p>We store and use the information you give us in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Our registration form requests that you provide certain contact and profile information (like your name, e-mail address, postal address, and phone number). Some of the requested information is required in order to receive VHMnetwork Services; other information is optional. The required information is indicated as such on the registration pages of the VHMnetwork Web Site. Depending on the specific VHMnetwork Services for which a user registers, certain category specific information will be requested. We use this additional data to personalize your VHMnetwork experience. By obtaining and using this information, we can provide you with prompt, relevant and individualized service according to your preferences and interests.</p>
<p>Other than the information we require in order to provide one or more VHMnetwork Services to you, you do not have to provide any further information. But your election to withhold certain information will limit the value of the VHMnetwork experience for you.</p>
<p>In addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and add it to your VHMnetwork membership information. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you).</p>
<p>We also collect information such as the identification of the server your computer is logged onto and whether you opened an VHMnetwork e-mail delivered to you. We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members. You can add and modify any of the information you have provided by following the instructions set forth below.</p>
<p>We use all of this information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to provide you with personalized information via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; </li>
  <li> to send you targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; </li>
  <li> to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; </li>
  <li> to send you general and administrative information about your VHMnetwork membership via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; and </li>
  <li> to provide your contact information to VHMnetwork marketing partners to allow them to send you special offers via electronic delivery and direct mail. This most often occurs when you request that we do so such as when completing an online survey.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Agents</strong>: We employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis. These agents have access to member personal information as needed to perform their functions for VHMnetwork, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Sell/License Data</strong>: VHMnetwork may sell and/or license the personal information that you provide to us to third party businesses. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation, email marketing, and telemarketing.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong>: We may use cookies to, among other things, save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the VHMnetwork Web Site. Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting the VHMnetwork Web Site may result in certain parts of the VHMnetwork Web Site not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed. For example, if you are a VHMnetwork member, you may need to enter your username and password each time you visit the VHMnetwork Web Site.</p>
<p><strong>Access Links</strong>: In some instances we may include certain links in our e-mails that will allow us to monitor whether you access specific content or advertisements contained in that e-mail. When you click on one of these links, we will record that click and certain activities on the Web page associated with that link. We may use this information for various purposes, such as to conduct internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior in and to our e-mail advertisements and content, and to better understand and serve you.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosures</strong>: VHMnetwork may disclose information about you and your use of the VHMnetwork Web Site and the VHMnetwork Services if VHMnetwork believes such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with the law or legal process; (ii) to protect or defend the rights or property of VHMnetwork or others; (iii) to enforce the VHMnetwork Terms and Conditions or this Privacy Policy; and (iv) to respond to claims that the content(s) of a communication violates the rights of another. In addition VHMnetwork may share or transfer information about you and that you provide to VHMnetwork, to one or more third party entities pursuant to a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion, or all of, the assets or stock of VHMnetwork or its affiliated entities, or as otherwise provided herein. VHMnetwork may also disclose information to allow third party business partners and affiliates deliver marketing offers to you; however we only make these types of disclosures if you request that we do so.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: The VHMnetwork Web Site has security measures in place intended to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our hardware infrastructure is housed in a controlled access facility that restricts access to authorized individuals with positive identification. Our network access to the infrastructure is protected by a firewall protection system. Information is backed up on a periodic basis to protect against accidental loss. However, we can not guarantee that communications between you and VHMnetwork will not be intercepted by others and that information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access. While we have taken reasonable precautions to protect this information, you should always use discretion in what information you send to us and not expect that such information will be absolutely free from intrusion.</p>
<p><strong>Reports</strong>: We periodically prepare analyses and reports reflecting visitor and member use of the VHMnetwork Web Site and VHMnetwork Service for our internal use as well as for a limited number of our business partners. These reports include aggregate (non-personal) information about VHMnetwork members, and in certain instances, visitors to the VHMnetwork Web Site. The information in these reports will not identify you individually. Our business partners who have access to these reports will not be able to contact you from the information contained in the reports.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong>: The VHMnetwork Web Site, as well as the electronic messages sent as part of the VHMnetwork Service, may contain links to other sites or services. VHMnetwork is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party sites. If you have a question about the privacy policy of those other sites, please contact them directly.</p>
<p><strong>Updates</strong>: VHMnetwork may revise this Policy at any time in the future to (i) improve or modify the VHMnetwork Service, (ii) reflect future developments in VHMnetwork data information gathering, storing and release practices, (iii) comply with applicable laws, and (iv) reflect changes in VHMnetwork business structure. Accordingly, you should review these terms and policy from time to time to check for updates. Your continued use of the VHMnetwork website shall evidence your acceptance of any changes.</p>
<p>If you do not accept the terms of this Policy, we ask that you not register with VHMnetwork. Your registration with VHMnetwork constitutes your acceptance of these terms and privacy policy.</p>
<p>Changing Your Status To have all of your personally identifiable information removed from our database, please go to Unsubscribe, and enter your email address. At the current time, we are not able to offer users the direct ability to delete their information from our database, but we will be happy to delete such information after we receive a request to that effect. Please be advised that by requesting that your data be removed from our database, you will be unsubscribed from the VHMnetwork Service and you forfeit your eligibility to participate in any VHMnetwork promotions.</p>
