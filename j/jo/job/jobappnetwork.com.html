<h1>JobApp / Privacy Policy</h1>
</header>
<div class="fourcol">
<p>Privacy Policy Effective Date: This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 1, 2013 (“Policy”), and supersedes all other JobApp privacy policies.</p>
<p>This Policy applies exclusively to the services provided directly by JobApp Networks, Inc. (“JobApp”; “our”; “we”; “us”), including those web services received from visiting JobAppPlus.com (the “Site”, and the services provided directly by JobApp, the “JobApp Services”). We provide this Policy as a means of making you aware of what data is collected, stored, used and retained when you visit the Site. Additional services may be made available by JobApp which may be provided by third party providers of JobApp. These services may be subject to different policies regarding the collection, storage, usage and retention. If you have difficulty finding the policies, or understanding when such policies are applicable, please contact JobApp for clarification.</p>
<p><strong>We do make changes to the Policy from time, so you should review the applicable terms of the policy each time you visit the Site.</strong></p>
<p>YOUR USE OF THE SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR CONSENT TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS POLICY, INCLUDING YOUR CONSENT TO THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS OUTLINED HEREIN. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, DO NOT USE THE SITE OR THE SERVICES.</p>
<p>Please direct your queries pertaining to the Site, the Services or this Policy to us at: CustomerSupport@JobAppPlus.com.</p>

<h2>Collection of Your Personal Information</h2>
</header>
<div class="fourcol">
<p>For purposes of this Policy, “Personal Information” means (i) information that identifies you, such as your name, address, phone and fax numbers or email address, (ii) information, files or data that you enter, provide, store or use in or with the Services, including your employment information, and (iii) tracking data, which is automatically collected from every Site visitor.</p>
<p>When you use the JobApp Services, you will be asked for information, such as your name, email, phone number, age, gender and zip code. You are responsible for providing current, accurate, and complete Personal Information. In the case that information becomes outdated or an error is identified, it is your responsibility to notify us of all pertinent changes.</p>
<p>In order to protect your Personal Information, you are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your password together with your login ID/email address that allows you access to the JobApp Services. Never write this password down and do not share it with others. If you access the JobApp Services via integration with a potential employer, you may not have a human readable password assigned to you. This authentication process is implemented by the potential employer and is required to comply with JobApp’s security standards.</p>
<p>Many, if not all, transaction details are recorded by JobApp. This information is used to provide information and assistance when using the JobApp Services. These details, other than in aggregate form, are not shared with any third parties.</p>
<p>For security and analytic purposes, we collect and store information based on your interactions through the JobApp Services. The Site automatically logs many of the details regarding all visits and requests to our web servers. This can include the browser type, cookie information, page requested by a visitor, and the visitor’s IP address. None of this information is personally identifiable. This information is used to help improve the Site and JobApp Services, analyze trends, and administer the Site. We attempt to aggregate such tracking data so that no such data is tied to you in any personally-identifiable manner, however, due to the nature of the Internet, this is not always feasible and tracking data may be traceable back to you.</p>

<h2>Use of Your Personal Information:</h2>
</header>
<div class="fourcol">
<p>As you can surmise, we provide your Personal Information to potential employers, who will use the information as they see fit, including to determine whether to make you an offer of employment or not. Additionally, we use and disclose your Personal Information whenever any of the following apply:</p>
<ul>A. You give us permission; B. to analyze the Site and improve the JobApp Services and our service offerings;</ul>
<ul>C. to third parties who perform services for us;</ul>
<ul>D. to deliver to you any administrative notices and communications relevant to your account and/ or your use of the JobApp Services;</ul>
<ul>E. when required by law, or reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, governmental request or court order;</ul>
<ul>F. to enforce our Terms and Conditions (www.JobAppPlus.com/Terms) or this Policy, including investigation of potential violations of the Terms and Conditions (www.JobAppPlus.com/Terms) or this Policy;</ul>
<ul>G. to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; H. to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of JobApp, its clients and customers, its users or the public as required or permitted by law;</ul>
<ul>I. to respond to an emergency; and</ul>
<ul>J. as otherwise set forth in this Policy</ul>
<p>Aggregated data containing no Personal Information identifying individual users may be shared, exchanged, sold or publicly disclosed and compiled, including for purposes of providing information regarding our JobApp Services and other service offerings. We may provide aggregate information to service providers for the purpose of aligning the proper services with users that need them. Information that would identify you personally is not disclosed during this process.</p>
<p>Where necessary, we may be legally obliged to disclose information as it pertains to any actions of a criminal or fraudulent nature. Without limiting the foregoing, we reserve the right to disclose information to government agencies where necessary in complying with a formal request such as in a civil suit, subpoena, court order or judicial proceeding. In addition, the violation of our Terms and Conditions (www.JobAppPlus.com/Terms) or the committing of a crime may necessitate the disclosure of the violator’s Personal Information.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
</header>
<div class="fourcol">
<p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards for your Personal Information, including using firewall barriers, encryption techniques, authentication procedures, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption, and physical safeguards. You should recognize, however, that there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet and we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information. In addition, because Internet communication is unsecure, it is also possible that the information you supply to us or your access of any information via the Site will be intercepted during transmission. WE CANNOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY BREACH OF OUR SYSTEMS OR INTERCEPTION OF OUR TRANSMISSION AND, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED UNDER LAW, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ENSURING, GUARANTEEING OR OTHERWISE OFFERING ANY DEFINITIVE PROMISE OF SECURITY IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OR USAGE INFORMATION.</p>
