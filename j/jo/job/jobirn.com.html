At InsidersReferral.com, Inc. ("Jobirn" or "we"), we know  you are concerned about your privacy, so we developed this Privacy Policy to  explain how we collect, use, share and disclose your Personal Information. <br><br>
By registering with Jobirn and/or using this site ("the  Site") or any other site that is operated by Jobirn, you are  accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. Each  time you visit the Site or provide us with information you agree that you are  consenting to our use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and  consenting to receive emails, as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy  Policy is incorporated into the Jobirn <a href="http://jobirn.com/term_and_conditions.html">Terms of Use</a>. If a  term is capitalized and not defined in this Privacy Policy, it is defined in  the <a href="http://jobirn.com/term_and_conditions.html">Terms of Use</a>. <br>
<h2><strong>Information Collection</strong></h2><br>
<strong><em>Account Information:</em></strong><br><br>
  In order to become an Jobirn user, you must first create an  account on this web site. To create an account you are required to provide the  following contact information: your instant-messenger ("<strong>IM</strong>", including MSN, Yahoo! Messenger, Google Talk and AIM) or email address, your date  of birth, and choose a password and screen name. <br><br>
<strong><em>Profile Information:</em></strong><br><br>
  If you choose to build a Profile, whatever member type you choose, you  will be required to enter information regarding name, email address, country,  ZIP/postal code, street address, home Phone. You will also be able to enter information about your cell phone and  work phone, and alumni information (including your college, graduated year,  major, degree and summary). <br><br>
According to the member type you choose, we also require you to enter  other information to help you. To become  an applicant, you must also enter your working experience, primary industry,  job function and upload your resume. You  can choose to enter your favorite companies. To become a referrer, your company, job function and working experience  is required. To become a recruiter, your  (staffing) company, primary industry to recruit for and working years as a  Recruiter is required. <br><br>
<strong><em>Information about your Contacts:</em></strong><br><br>
  In order to invite others to connect with you directly or get recommended  from others in Jobirn, you will need to enter their names and IM/email  addresses. This information will be used by Jobirn to send your  invitation including a message that you write. The names and IM/email addresses  of people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and  reminders. <br>
  <br>
<strong><em>Cookies, Log Files &amp; IP Address:</em></strong><br><br>
  As you use our Service, we may also passively collect certain information,  including your Internet protocol address, browser type, domain names, access  times, and operating system. We also use Cookies, clear GIFs, and navigational  data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the  date and time of your use of the Service. This type of information is collected  to make our Services more useful to you and to help us improve the Site. You  must accept cookies to access Jobirn as a registered user. <br><br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
<strong><em>Children:</em></strong><br><br>
  Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under  the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service. <br>
<h2><strong>Use of Information</strong></h2><br>
<strong><em>Use of</em></strong> <strong><em>Personally Identifiable Information by  Jobirn:</em></strong><br><br>
We use the collected personally identifiable information to verify you and  to contact you in connection with your transactions, postings and other  activities on the Site, to forward to you messages from other Users, to  communicate with you about Job opportunities of interest to you and to operate  the Jobirn Service. <br>
Use of our invitation or get recommended service to tell a friend about  our Site or a job opportunity, or your request for recommendation, or to  participate in a referral chain, requires that you enter your friend's IM/email  address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time IM/email inviting  him or her to visit the site or view the opportunity. Jobirn  stores this information to send this one-time IM/email, to register a friend  connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of the  Jobirn referral program. Your friend may contact us at  Jobirn to request that we remove this information from view in  our active database (please use Jobirn Privacy in the subject  line). <br><br>
<strong><em>Use of Personally Identifiable Information by Other Users:</em></strong><br><br>
Other users will be able to search and view the personally identifiable  information that you provide on your profile, except your contact information  and resume (could search, but can't view). We allow referrers or recruiters to view and download your resume, for  the purpose of employment. <br>
<br>
Other users may choose to contact you, and you may choose to contact other users. Jobirn has developed a process that uses a "double-blind" email system, which hides the IM/email addresses of both the sender and recipient of messages to protect the privacy of both the sender and receiver. When using the process on the site, it is up to you to choose when you are comfortable disclosing your IM/email address, or any other contact information, to others through private communications. <br>
<br>
Your contact information will only be shared with another user if both  of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other. <br>
<br>
<h2><strong>Information Sharing and  Disclosure</strong></h2><br>
We may disclose your personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, etc., to third parties, including business partners, independent contractors, auditors, lawyers for purposes that we deem appropriate. If you choose to receive a service offered on Jobirn, and if that that service is provided by a partner or third-party company (e.g. education opportunity, resume services which are provided by third parties), personal information about you (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to Jobirn) will be shared with those partners to the extent necessary for them to provide these services.   Third party lead generation company may contact you by phone and/or by email to provide education related information.  These third party service providers are only allowed to use personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the specific services.<br>
<br> In addition, if we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of all or a material part of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of our business, we may transfer your personal information to the party or parties involved as part of that transaction.
  <br>
  <br>
<h2><strong>Update/Delete Your Information  and Preferences</strong></h2><br>
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Jobirn service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Jobirn Newsletter, that are considered "transactional or relationship" messages, or otherwise part of your Jobirn account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. <br><br>
You can delete your Jobirn account by clicking on  "Close account" in "Setting" tab after you login.  Jobirn may retain your information for our own records. <br>
<h2><strong>Confidentiality and Security</strong></h2><br>
We use reasonable security measures to protect personal information from unauthorized use, alteration, and disclosure.  We restrict access of your personal information from our employees, unless we believe it is reasonably necessary to do their jobs.<br><br>
<h2><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></h2><br>
This site contains links to other sites (including co-branded links). Please be aware that Jobirn does not exercise control over the information, products, services or policies of third party companies accessible through our site. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy policies of each and every third party site. This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information collected by this site.<br>
<h2><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></h2><br><br>
Jobirn reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy at any point. Users will always have access to our current Privacy Policy by visiting <a href="http://jobirn.com">jobirn.com</a>.  If we change this Privacy Policy, we will notify users by posting notice on our site or by notice sent using contact information we have on file, and will update the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make a change that is materially less restrictive upon our use and disclosure of personal information that we collected prior to the effective date of the change, we will notify users as described above and will seek consent before using or disclosing any previously-collected information in a manner that would violate the prior privacy policy.
