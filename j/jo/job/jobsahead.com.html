LLC, are committed to respecting the privacy of our users. We 
strive to provide a safe, secure user experience. This Privacy 
Statement sets forth the online data collection and usage policies 
and practices that apply to Jobsahead.com (sometimes referred 
to herein as the "Site") and does not apply to information 
we collect in any other fashion.</font><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your 
data will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the 
United States and India. The information we gather on Jobsahead.com 
may be shared within the Monster-affiliated companies on a worldwide 
basis in order to deliver the products and services we offer 
to employers such as searches for job seekers or in order to 
undertake analysis of our database such as aggregate profiling 
of our registered users. "Affiliated companies" means 
entities that control, are controlled by or are under common

We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other

Collection and Use of Information by Jobsahead</font></b><br>
<br>
</font></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
some areas of Jobsahead.com, we request or may request that 
you provide personal information, including your name, address, 
e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, contact 
information, billing information and any other information from 
which your identity is discernible. In other areas, we collect 
or may collect demographic information that is not unique to 
you such as your PIN code, age, preferences, gender, interests 
and favorites. Sometimes we collect or may collect a combination 
of the two types of information. Examples of areas on the Site 
where we collect personal or combined personal and demographic 
data are pages where you can open a My Jobsahead account, sign 
up to use a service, post a resume, enter a contest or purchase 
a product. In addition, we may indirectly collect information 
about you when you use certain third party services available 
on Jobsahead. For example, if you register on Jobsahead by using 
your Microsoft Passport user name and password, you authorize 
us to have access to and store the information in your Passport 
account profile; such information will be subject to, and treated 
in accordance with, the policies and practices described in 
this Privacy Statement.<br>
</font> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
also gather or may gather certain information about your use 
of Monster, such as what areas you visit and what services you 
access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware 
and software that is or may be collected by us. This information 
can include without limitation your IP address, browser type, 
domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses, 
but is not linked to your personal information.<br>
We may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, 
cultural, behavioral, preferential and/or life style information 
about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish 
such information. If you do provide such information, you are 
thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance 
with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Statement. 
For example, such information may be used for the purpose of 
determining your potential interest in receiving e-mail or other 
communications about particular products or services.<br>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about 
Jobsahead.com or other Monster Sites or refer a job posting 
to a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name and email 
address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email 
inviting him or her to visit the Site(s) or view the job posting. 
We do not store this information.</font>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
you have provided consent for us to do so, we may also use the 
information we gather to inform you of other products or services 
available from us or our affiliated companies or to contact 
you about your opinion of current products and services or potential 
new products and services that may be offered.<br>
We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail 
or other communications regarding updates at the Site, and if 
you have requested, information on new opportunities and additional 
job postings which may be of interest to you. The nature and 
frequency of these messages will vary depending upon the information 
we have about you.<br>
In addition, at the time of registration for a My Jobsahead 
account, you have the option to elect or not elect to receive 
additional communications, information and promotions, including 
without limitation, free informational newsletters from us relating 
to topics that may be of special interest to you, such as career 
management advice. <br>
We have areas on the Monster Sites where you can submit feedback. 
Any feedback you submit in these areas becomes our property, 
and we can use such feedback (such as success stories) for marketing 
purposes or to contact you for further information. </font>

Choices Regarding the Disclosure of Personal Information to

disclose information to third parties if you consent to such 
disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like

Jobsahead account, we supply your contact information to third 
parties such as employers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers

whether you might be interested in the opportunities, products

We disclose information to companies and individuals we employ

to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good 
faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal 
requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our 
rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent

Other Uses of Information</font></b>

also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to 
Monster (for example, the number of visitors to Jobsahead's job 
search area) with its clients, partners and other third parties 
so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Monster 
Sites and how those visitors use the Monster Sites.<br>
We supply technology, hosting and related services to other leading 
companies to power recruitment areas on their Web sites (sometimes 
referred to as "Hosted Career Sites"). Personal and/or 
demographic information supplied by you in Hosted Career Sites 
becomes part of the Monster database, but it is not accessible 
by anyone other than you, Monster and the company concerned without 
your consent. <br>
Information gathered on a page in a Hosted Career Site or on a 
co-branded page (such as that of a contest co-sponsored by Jobsahead 
and another company), may become the property of the other company 
or of both us and the other company. In that instance, the use 
of such information by the other company will be subject to the 
privacy policy of that company. We are not responsible for that 
company's use of your personal or demographic information.<br>
If you apply for a position on Jobsahead or through a Hosted Career 
Site, you may be asked to provide information on your gender, 
race or other protected status where permitted by applicable law. 
Some employers are required by law to gather this information 
from job applicants for reporting and record-keeping requirements. 
You should understand that if provided, this information will 
be used by employers only in accordance with applicable law and 
will not be used in making any negative employment decisions. 
All information provided will be kept separate from your expression 
of interest in any job opportunity. Providing this information 
is strictly voluntary and you will not be subject to any adverse 
action or treatment if you choose not to provide this information.</font>

Use of Cookies</font></b><br>

</p><p></p><div align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize 
your online experience and time online. A cookie is a text 
file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. 
Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses 
to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your 
computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain 
that issued the cookie to you. <br>
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience 
feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to 
tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific 
page. For example, if you personalize Monster pages, or 
register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your 
specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). 
Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and 
more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. 
When you return to Monster, the information you previously 
provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features 
that you customized. We also use cookies to track click 
streams and for load balancing.<br>
You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most 
Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually 
modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you 
prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser 
setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and 
permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual 
basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may 
hinder performance and negatively impact your experience 
on Monster. </font>

Use of Web Beacons</font></b><br>

Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons

co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access 
your personally identifiable information; they are a technique 
we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Web 
site usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of 
information including a cookie number, time and date of 
a page view, and a description of the page on which the 
Web beacon resides. <br>
You may not decline web beacons, however, they can be 
rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying
