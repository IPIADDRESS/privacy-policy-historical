						<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
						
						<p class="quiet"><em>This Privacy Policy was created on May 4, 2004</em></p>
						<p class="quiet"><em>This Privacy Policy was last updated on March 27, 2009</em></p>

						<p>This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how Jobvite, Inc. (“Jobvite,” “we” or “us”) collect, use and share personally identifiable information of visitors of our web site (the “Site”) and users our on-demand recruitment application (the “Services”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@jobvite.com" target="_blank">admin@jobvite.com</a>. By using the Site and/or Services, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>
						<p>Jobvite reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Jobvite will post the revised Privacy Policy on this Site located at <a href="http://www.jobvite.com/Recruiting/PrivacyPolicy.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.jobvite.com/Recruiting/PrivacyPolicy.aspx</a> and will either send a notice to the e-mail address that you specified in your registration and/or post notice of the change so it is visible when users log-on for the first time after the change is posted so that you are always aware of what personal information Jobvite may collect and how Jobvite may use this information. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of the Site and/or Services will be subject to the then-current Privacy Policy.   </p>

						<h4>What We Collect and How We Use It.</h4>
						<p>You can generally visit the Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.  We do not collect personal information from our Site visitors without the Site visitor providing us with this information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  </p>

						<p>If you request to receive company or product information or request an online demonstration of the Services, you will be asked to complete the online demo request form on our Site that asks for your name, title, e-mail address, company name, state or province, country, phone number.  You can also voluntarily provide comments to Jobvite when submitting the request form. We use the information from the request form to deliver the requested information and/or provide you with the online demonstration of the Services.</p>
						<p>In order to become a registered user of the Services, Jobvite requires you to create a user account. To register for a user account, you must provide the following personally identifiable information: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>If you are an employer, you must provide your company’s name and e-mail address of a contact at your company.</li>
							<li>If you are an employee of an employer, you must provide your name, e-mail address, country and zip code.</li>
							<li>If you are a jobseeker, you must provide your name, e-mail address, country, zip code and password.</li>
						</ul>    
						
						<p>Providing any additional information beyond what is required at registration is optional.</p>
						<p>Jobvite may also gather information about you [that you voluntarily submit to Jobvite] when you log-in to the Services, provide feedback to Jobvite and/or send or receive communications regarding the Services. </p>
						<p> Jobvite may use your personally identifiable information to register you to use the Services and provide you with the Services; verify your authority to enter the Site and access the Services; notify you of Services updates; improve the content and general administration of the Site and the Services; provide you with notices regarding the Services and other services that you have purchased or may wish to purchase in the future; and to send you targeted advertising. Jobvite does not provide e-mail addresses to third parties for marketing purposes. </p>
						<p>When you send messages through the Services, your name and e-mail address will be identified in the message and the addressee may view your name and e-mail address. Any messages addressed to you through the Services can be sent to your personal e-mail address or to your Jobvite account inbox by setting your preferences on the “My settings” page.</p>
						<p>If you elect to use our Site or the Services to contact a jobseeker or potential employer, Jobvite will generate an automatic e-mail that is sent to the jobseeker or potential employer, as applicable, inviting the jobseeker or potential employer to visit the Site.  If the targeted recipient does not respond to the e-mail, Jobvite will not send any reminder e-mails or use this contact information for any other purpose. </p>

						<p><strong>Invitations and Communications to Non-Registered Users.</strong>  Jobvite users or visitors to the career sites of Jobvite customers may forward job postings to third parties who are not registered users of the Site as an invitation to learn more about this job opportunity in accordance with the applicable terms set forth in the Jobvite Terms of Use posted to the Site at <a href="http://www.jobvite.com/Recruiting/TermsAndConditions.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.jobvite.com/Recruiting/TermsAndConditions.aspx </a>.</p>
						<p><strong>Aggregate Information.</strong>  Jobvite may also automatically collect and analyze information about your general usage of the Site and Services. When you perform certain actions using the Services, Jobvite may track your usage patterns to see what features of the Site and Services you commonly use, Site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser, browser language, IP address and operating system. Jobvite will collect, track and analyze such information in an aggregate manner that does not personally identify you. This aggregate data may be used by Jobvite and third party vendors to assist Jobvite in operating the Site and the Services and provided to other third parties to enable them to better understand the operation of Jobvite’s business, but such information will be in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable data. </p>
						<p><strong>Children.</strong> Jobvite recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests.  This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we endeavor not to collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.  Jobvite targets its Services and this Site to adults and not to children under 13.  </p>

						<p><strong>Disclosure of Your Personal Information.</strong>  The resume or job application that you submit will be provided to the specific potential employers that you select when you apply for jobs online, but other employers and recruiters will not have access to your resume or job application. </p>
						<p>Jobvite engages vendors and service agencies to assist us in providing the Services to you, and Jobvite will need to share your personally identifiable information [and data generated by cookies and beacons] with these vendors and service agencies. The vendors and service agencies do not receive any right to use your personally identifiable information beyond what is necessary to perform its obligations to provide the Services to you.  Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Jobvite will not disclose personally identifiable information to third parties, including, but not limited to, companies affiliated with Jobvite, without your consent. We will also disclose your personally identifiable information: (a) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an investigation of a governmental authority, (b) to enforce the Jobvite Terms of Use or Master Subscription Agreement or (c) to protect the safety of users of our Site and our Services.  In addition, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Jobvite participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Jobvite’s assets to which this Site relates. </p>
						<p><strong>Transfer of Information.</strong>  Your personally identifiable information collected on this Site and through the Services is stored and processed in the United States where Jobvite [or its agents] currently maintain its computer systems. Your personal data will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with the Site as a visitor from outside the United States, by using the Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
						<p><strong>Cookies &amp; Beacons.</strong> Jobvite uses beacons to track the status of sent emails, including job invitations sent as Jobvites. Cookies are files sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Jobvite’s persistent and session ID cookies are used to identify unique visitors and to provide a personalized user experience. Beacons are bits of code that function similar to cookies. Jobvite’s beacons are embedded in outgoing emails and generate a call back to the Jobvite server when such emails are opened. Jobvite uses beacons to track the status of sent emails including job invitations sent as Jobvites.</p>

						<p><strong>Security.</strong> Jobvite may employ procedural and technological measures to protect your personally identifiable information. These measures are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Jobvite may use software, encryption, password protection, firewalls, internal restrictions and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information. However, Jobvite cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat these measures or use your personally identifiable information for improper purposes. Therefore, you should be aware that when you voluntarily display or distribute personally identifiable information, that information could be collected and used by others. Jobvite is not responsible for the unauthorized use by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available.</p>
						<p><strong>Links.</strong> The Site may provide links to third party web sites or resources not associated with Jobvite and over which Jobvite does not have control (“External Web Sites”).  Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Jobvite of the External Web Sites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith. You acknowledge that Jobvite is only providing these links as a convenience, and you agree that Jobvite is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites.  Your use of External Web Sites is subject to the respective terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked to External Web Sites.
