										<p><i>Last Updated September 28, 2007</i></p>
										<p>At Jobvite, we are committed to protecting your right to privacy while visiting our web site (the "Site") or using our on-demand recruitment application (the "Service). This Jobvite Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") explains how we collect, use and share your personally identifiable information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@jobvite.com">admin@jobvite.com</a></p>
										<p>By using the Jobvite Site and/or Service you consent to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Jobvite reserves the right to change this privacy policy from time to time, and will post any revisions on this Site located at www.jobvite.com. We encourage you to review this Jobvite Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this Site and/or the Services will be subject to the then-current Jobvite privacy policy. In the event there are significant changes in this Privacy Policy, Jobvite may notify you by sending a notice to the email address you specified in your registration or by displaying a prominent notice on the Site.</p>
										<p>If you choose to receive company or product information, you may be asked to complete the online data request forms on our Site. The online demo and download request forms allow site visitors to request demonstrations of the Jobvite application and view free reports and product information. These forms require name, email address, company name, phone number and other information to help us respond to your information requests. All information provided by the visitor is voluntary. </p>
										<p>We do not collect email addresses without the site visitor voluntarily providing us with this information; visitors provide this information via an online data or demo request form. We will periodically use your email information to send you service, sales, support or marketing information. If you do not wish to receive marketing information from us in the future, you may opt out by unsubscribing here: http://www.jobvite.com/Info/Unsubscribe.aspx </p>
										<p>What We Collect and How We Use It.   In order to become a registered user of the Service, Jobvite will require you to create a user account. To register you must provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address and password. Once a registered user, you may opt to provide additional personally identifiable information in your profile such as your full name and address. Providing any additional information beyond what is required at registration is optional. </p>
										<p>In addition to the information that you provide during registration, Jobvite may gather information about you when you log in to the Service, provide feedback and send or receive communications regarding the Service. Jobvite may also automatically collect and analyze information about your general usage of the Site and Services. When you perform certain actions using the Service, Jobvite may track your usage patterns to see what features of the Site and Service you commonly use, Site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser, browser language, IP address and operating system. Jobvite may also collect, track and analyze such information in aggregate in a manner that does not personally identify you. This aggregate data may be used by Jobvite and third party vendors to assist Jobvite in operating the Site and the Services and provided to other third parties to enable them to better understand the operation of Jobvite's business, but such information will be in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable data. </p>
										<p>When you provide any personally identifiable information, Jobvite uses it, where appropriate, to establish and provide the Service; verify your authority to enter the Site and access the Service; notify you of Service updates; improve the content of the Site and the quality of the Service and generally administer the Site and the Service. Jobvite may also contact you to request additional information and feedback or to provide you with information about Jobvite products or services. When you send messages through the Jobvite Service, your name and email address will be identified in the message. All of these messages can be sent to your primary email address or to your Jobvite account inbox by setting your preferences on the "my settings" page. If you wish to be removed from such secondary mailings you may do so by the means provided in the email. </p>
										<p>If you elect to use our Site or the Service for reaching a person or company, Jobvite will generate an automatic email that is sent to that person or Company. Jobvite will automatically send this target person an email inviting them to visit the Site. If this person does not respond, Jobvite will not send any reminder emails or use this contact information for any other purpose. </p>
										<p>Jobvite users or visitors to the career sites of Jobvite customers may forward job postings to third parties who are not users of Jobvite as an invitation to learn more about this job opportunity, in accordance with the Terms of Use posted to our web site available at <a href="TermsAndConditions.aspx">TERMS OF USE.</a></p>
										<p>Children. Neither the Site nor the Services are intended for children under 18 years of age. Jobvite does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
										<p>Disclosure and Storage of Your Personal Information. Jobvite may employ companies and people to perform tasks on its behalf, and will need to share personally identifiable information with these agents to establish and deliver the Service to you. Jobvite's agents do not receive any right to use your personally identifiable information beyond what is necessary to perform these tasks. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Jobvite will not disclose registration information to third parties, including, but not limited to, companies affiliated with Jobvite, without your consent. We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority. In addition, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Jobvite participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Jobvite's assets. Such successor entity shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
										<p>Resumes and applications. The resume or job application that you submit will be provided to the specific potential employers that you select when you apply for jobs online, but other employers and recruiters will not have access to it. </p>
										<p>Transfer of information. Your personally identifiable information collected on this Site and through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Jobvite.com or Jobvite or its agents maintain facilities, and by using this Site and/or the Services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
										<p>Cookies &amp; Beacons. Jobvite uses beacons to track the status of sent emails including job invitations sent as Jobvites. Cookies are files sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Jobvite's persistent and session ID Cookies are used to identify unique visitors and to provide a personalized user experience. Beacons are bits of code that function similar to cookies. Jobvite's beacons are embedded in outgoing emails and generate a call back to the Jobvite server when such emails are opened. Jobvite uses beacons to track the status of sent emails including job invitations sent as Jobvites.</p>
										<p>Security. Jobvite may employ procedural and technological measures to protect your personally identifiable information. Such measures are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Jobvite may use software, encryption, password protection, firewalls, internal restrictions and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information. However, Jobvite cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat these measures or use your personally identifiable information for improper purposes. Therefore, you should be aware that when you voluntarily display or distribute personally identifiable information, that information could be collected and used by others. Jobvite is not responsible for the unauthorized use by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available.</p>
										<p>Links. The Site may contain links to third party web sites not associated with Jobvite.
