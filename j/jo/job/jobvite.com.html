<p><strong>Information  We Collect and How We Use It.</strong></p>
<p>You can generally visit the Site  without revealing any  personally identifiable information about yourself. We do  not collect  personal information from our Site visitors without the Site  visitor  providing us with this information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you request to receive company or  product information or  request an online demonstration of the Services, you  will be asked to  complete the online demo request form on our Site that asks  for your  name, title, e-mail address, company name, state or province, country   and phone number. You can also voluntarily provide comments to Jobvite  when  submitting the request form. We use the information from the  request form to  deliver the requested information and/or provide you  with the online demonstration  of the Services.</p>
<p>In order to become a registered user of the Services, Jobvite  requires you to create a user account. To register for a user account,  you must provide the following personally identifiable information:</p>
<ul><li>If you are an employer, you must provide your company’s       name and e-mail address of a contact at your company.</li>
<li>If you are an employee of an employer, you must provide       your name, e-mail address, country and zip code.</li>
<li>If you are a jobseeker, you must provide your  name, e-mail address, country, zip code and password. </li>
</ul><p>Providing any additional information  beyond what is required at registration is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate  Information.</strong></p>
<p>Jobvite may also automatically  collect and analyze  information about your general usage of the Site and  Services. When you  perform certain actions using the Services, Jobvite may  track your  usage patterns to see what features of the Site and Services you   commonly use, Site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of   transactions, type of browser, browser language, IP address and  operating  system, and statistical information about types of jobs  offered and  qualifications of jobseekers submitting their resumes.  Jobvite will collect,  track and analyze such information in an  aggregate manner that does not  personally identify you. This aggregate  data may be used by Jobvite and third  party vendors to assist Jobvite  in operating the Site and the Services and  provided to other third  parties to enable them to better understand the  operation of Jobvite’s  business, but such information will be in aggregate form  only and it  will not contain personally identifiable data. Jobvite may also  gather  information about you (that you voluntarily submit to Jobvite) when you   log-in to the Services, provide feedback to Jobvite and/or send or  receive  communications regarding the Services.</p>
<p>Jobvite may use your personally  identifiable information to  register you to use the Services and provide you  with the Services;  verify your authority to enter the Site and access the  Services; notify  you of Services updates; improve the content and general   administration of the Site and the Services; provide you with notices  regarding  the Services and other services that you have purchased or  may wish to purchase  in the future; and to send you targeted  advertising. Jobvite does not provide  e-mail addresses to third parties  for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>When you send messages through the  Services, your name and  e-mail address will be identified in the message and  the addressee may  view your name and e-mail address. Any messages addressed to  you  through the Services can be sent to your personal e-mail address or to  your  Jobvite account inbox by setting your preferences on the “My  settings” page.</p>
<p>If you elect to use our Site or the Services to  contact a  jobseeker or potential employer, Jobvite will generate an automatic   e-mail that is sent to the jobseeker or potential employer, as  applicable,  inviting the jobseeker or potential employer to visit the  Site. If the targeted  recipient does not respond to the e-mail, Jobvite  will not send any reminder  e-mails or use this contact information for  any other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Invitations and Communications to  Non-Registered Users.</strong></p>
<p>Users of the Services and visitors  to the  career sites of our customers may forward job postings to third parties   who are not registered users of the Site or the Services as an  invitation to  learn more about this job opportunity in accordance with  the applicable terms  set forth in the Jobvite Terms of Use posted to  the Site at <a href="http://www.jobvite.com/Recruiting/TermsAndConditions.aspx">http://www.jobvite.com/Recruiting/TermsAndConditions.aspx</a> Jobvite does not store the information that a posting or  invitation  has gone to a third party unless and until that third party responds  to  the invitation.&nbsp; If the third party  responds to the invitation, the  third party is treated like any other  job-seeker, and the information  Jobvite collects is treated in accordance with  this privacy policy; in  addition Jobvite will note at that time who invited the  referral so  that Jobvite customers are aware of the source of the referral and  may  use that information to reward the referring person.</p>
<p><strong>Children.</strong></p>
<p>Jobvite recognizes the privacy interests of   children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role  in their  children’s online activities and interests. This Site is not  intended for  children under the age of 13 and we endeavor not to  collect any personally  identifiable information from children under the  age of 13. Jobvite targets its  Services and this Site to adults and  not to children under 13.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure  of Your Personal Information.</strong></p>
<p>We will share your personal information  with  third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy  policy.&nbsp; We do not sell your personal information to  third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Information Related to Data Collected through Jobvite Services</strong></p>
<p>Jobvite collects information under the   direction of its customers, and has no direct relationship with the  individuals  whose personal data it processes. Part of the Services  offered by our employer  customers includes providing notice to their  employees and job-seekers concerning  how their personal information is  collected and used.&nbsp; The resume or job application that an  employee or  other job-seeker submits will be provided only to the specific   potential employers that you select when you apply for jobs online.  Other  employers and recruiters will not have access to your resume or  job application  unless and until you want them to.</p>
<p>Jobvite engages vendors and service  agencies  to assist us in providing the Services to you, and Jobvite will need  to  share your personally identifiable information (and data generated by   cookies and beacons) with these vendors and service agencies. <em>The  vendors and service agencies do not  receive any right to use your  personally identifiable information beyond what  is necessary to perform  its obligations to provide the Services to you.</em> Except as provided  in this Privacy Policy, Jobvite will not disclose personally   identifiable information to third parties, including, but not limited  to,  companies affiliated with Jobvite, without your consent.</p>
<p><strong>Choice and Access to Data Controlled by our Customers:</strong></p>
<p>Jobvite  has no direct relationship with the  individual employees and job-seekers whose  personal data it processes  on our behalf of our customers. Individuals applying  for jobs with  employers that are Jobvite customers have an account set up under  their  email address that associates all applications for that individual with   that email address. The individual can access their account at the  Site and transmit  requests to the employers to correct, amend, or  delete inaccurate data in an  application. The employer is responsible  for complying with the individual’s  request. In accordance with  applicable law, Jobvite retains an archive copy of  the individual’s  data for the period prescribed by such law. Additionally, if  you are an  employee or job-seeker and would no longer like to be contacted by a   particular employer or employers, please contact them directly to  resolve your  concern.</p>
<p><strong>Information Disclosure for Legal and Other Exceptional Reasons</strong></p>
<p>We may also disclose your personally   identifiable information: (a) if we are required to do so by law,  regulation or  other government authority or otherwise in cooperation  with an investigation of  a governmental authority, (b) to enforce the  Jobvite Terms of Use or Master  Subscription Agreement or (c) to protect  our rights and the safety of users of  our Site and our Services. In  addition, we may transfer your personally  identifiable information to a  successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or  other corporate  reorganization in which Jobvite participates or to a purchaser  of all  or substantially all of Jobvite’s assets to which this Site relates.</p>
<p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>
<p>Jobvite  retains personal information and the  personal data we process on behalf of our customers  for as long as  needed to provide the Services to customers, job-seekers and  employees  enrolled in those Services. We will retain and use this personal   information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve   disputes, and enforce our agreements with customers, and/or the period  required  by laws in applicable jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>Updating,  Correcting and Deleting Your Information.</strong></p>
<p>Jobvite provides an individual that supplies   information on the Site with the ability to review correct and request  the  deletion of any of the personally identifiable information that was  entered  into their profile on the Site. To correct or delete any  information in a Site profile,  an individual may update that profile  (through their account page on the Site)  or may contact Jobvite by  e-mailing our customer support at <a href="mailto:JobviteCares@jobvite.com">JobviteCares@jobvite.com</a>.&nbsp;  We will  respond to the request within 30 days. &nbsp;Alternatively,  you  may send a letter with your requested changes, corrections or deletions  to  the following address:</p>
<p>By mail: <br> Jobvite, Inc. <br> Attn: Privacy Policy <br>1300 El Camino Real, Suite 400<br>San Mateo, CA 94402</p>
<p>When  an individual terminates their account on the Site, we  will remove &nbsp;their profile from the Site. Information  supplied by an  employee or job seeker in an application or resume submitted to  an  employer that is a Jobvite customer is treated as described above in the   section <strong>“Choice and Access to Data  Controlled by our Customers.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Transfer of Information.</strong></p>
<p>Your personally identifiable  information collected on this  Site and through the Services is stored and  processed in the United  States where Jobvite (or its agents) currently maintain  its computer  systems. Your personal data will be processed by us in the United   States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the  same  level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the  European Union.

<p><strong>Cookies &amp; Beacons.</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are files sent to your  browser from a web server and  stored on your computer’s hard drive.&nbsp; We use both session ID cookies  and persistent  cookies.&nbsp; A session ID cookie expires  when you close  your browser while a persistent cookie remains on your hard  drive for  an extended period of time.&nbsp; You  can remove persistent cookies by  following directions provided in your Internet  browser’s “help” file.&nbsp;  Jobvite’s  persistent and session ID cookies are used to identify unique  visitors and to  provide a personalized user experience.&nbsp; If  you  reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use our   application and some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys,  will be  limited.</p>
