					  <h4>What We Collect and How We Use It.</h4>

					  <p>Jobvite engages vendors and service agencies to assist us in providing the Services to you, and Jobvite will need to share your personally identifiable information [and data generated by cookies and beacons] with these vendors and service agencies. The vendors and service agencies do not receive any right to use your personally identifiable information beyond what is necessary to perform its obligations to provide the Services to you.  Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Jobvite will not disclose personally identifiable information to third parties, including, but not limited to, companies affiliated with Jobvite, without your consent.

In addition, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Jobvite participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Jobvite’s assets to which this Site relates. </p>
					  <p><strong>Transfer of Information.</strong>  Your personally identifiable information collected on this Site and through the Services is stored and processed in the United States where Jobvite [or its agents] currently maintain its computer systems.

If you create a user account with the Site as a visitor from outside the United States, by using the Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
					  <p><strong>Cookies &amp; Beacons.</strong> Jobvite uses beacons to track the status of sent emails, including job invitations sent as Jobvites. Cookies are files sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Jobvite’s persistent and session ID cookies are used to identify unique visitors and to provide a personalized user experience. Beacons are bits of code that function similar to cookies. Jobvite’s beacons are embedded in outgoing emails and generate a call back to the Jobvite server when such emails are opened. Jobvite uses beacons to track the status of sent emails including job invitations sent as Jobvites.</p>

					  <p><strong>Security.</strong> Jobvite may employ procedural and technological measures to protect your personally identifiable information. These measures are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Jobvite may use software, encryption, password protection, firewalls, internal restrictions and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information.
