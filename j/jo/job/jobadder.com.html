						<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
						<h2>JOB ADDER PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
						<p><span>Job Adder Pty Ltd ATF Job Adder Unit Trust ABN 90 375 665 944</span>&nbsp;(<strong>JOB ADDER</strong>) understands that privacy is important to you, and is committed to complying with the National Privacy Principles (NPPs), which are contained in the&nbsp;<em>Privacy Act 1988</em>&nbsp;(Privacy Act).</p>
						<p>From 21 December 2001, the NPPs have governed how organisations in the private sector handle 'personal information' (which is basically information which can identify you).</p>
						<h2>1. What Personal Information Does JOB ADDER Collect?</h2>
						<p>JOB ADDER is an online recruitment software provider. The types of personal information that JOB ADDER collects will depend on the nature of your dealings with us.</p>
						<p>If you are a licensed user of JOB ADDER'S online recruitment software system, we may collect personal information provided by you about you, or about your clients, in order to provide the services you require from us.</p>
						<p>If you own or license a website that was built by JOB ADDER, and which we host on our server, we may collect personal information submitted to the website by your clients e.g. resumes submitted by job candidates. We may also collect personal information provided by you to enable us to provide the services you require from us.</p>
						<p>If you are one of JOB ADDER's 'business contacts' (e.g. a contact person in one of our suppliers, or in an agency or company with which we deal), we may collect basic business contact information from you (e.g. your name, title and work contact details).</p>
						<h2>2. How does JOB ADDER use Personal Information?</h2>
						<p>We need to collect personal information so that we can provide our products and services, and conduct our business. We also collect personal information so that we may communicate any new information about our products and services to our clients and to people who have requested information from us via our website.</p>
						<p>For example, if you are a client, or someone who has requested information from us via our website, personal information about you may be used to provide you with information on our products and services, or information you have requested.</p>
						<p>JOB ADDER's policy is only to use personal information collected from clients and business contacts for the business purpose for which it was collected.</p>
						<h2>3. Will Your Personal Information be Given to Anyone Else?</h2>
						<p>JOB ADDER does not sell, rent or trade personal information about you to or with third parties. Personal information may be disclosed outside of JOB ADDER in the circumstances described below:</p>
						<p>(a) Disclosures to external service providers</p>
						<p>JOB ADDER may disclose personal information to external service providers who help us operate our business (e.g. JOB ADDER'S external internet hosting company, which hosts JOB ADDER'S online recruitment management system at www.jobadder.com)</p>
						<p>If JOB ADDER engages external service providers, JOB ADDER takes steps to ensure that those external service providers:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>comply with the NPPs when they handle personal information about you (regardless of whether they are a small business, and would otherwise be exempt from the new privacy laws); and</li>
							<li>are authorised only to use personal information for the limited purposes specified in our agreement with them.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>(b) Disclosures required or permitted by law</p>
						<p>Otherwise, JOB ADDER will only disclose personal information if this is required by law or permitted under the Privacy Act.</p>
						<h2>4. Security of Personal Information</h2>
						<p>JOB ADDER takes reasonable steps to ensure the security of your personal information. Our premises are in a secure building with access restricted to passcard holders. Our IT systems are password protected and we conduct regular audit and data integrity checks. We frequently update our anti-virus software in order to protect our systems (and the data contained in those systems) from computer viruses. In addition, all JOB ADDER employees are required, as a condition of employment, to treat personal information held by JOB ADDER as confidential.</p>
						<h2>5. Access and Correction</h2>
						<p>Under the Privacy Act, you have the right to seek access to your personal information handled by JOB ADDER. You also have the right to ask us to update or correct your personal information when it is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date.</p>
						<p>If you wish to access the personal information that JOB ADDER holds about you, please set out your request in writing, and forward this to us, using the contact details set out at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>
						<p>To provide you with access to your personal information held by us on our current records, JOB ADDER can provide you with a copy of the relevant personal information (ordinarily, an electronic print-out or a photocopy). JOB ADDER will not charge you for the cost of providing this type of access to these current records.</p>
						<p>For legal and administrative reasons, JOB ADDER may also archive non-current records containing personal information, such as back up data files and off-site storage.</p>
						<p>If you are of the view that personal information about you is inaccurate or out of date, or if you have any other queries about access and correction, please contact us using the contact details set out below.</p>
						<h2>6. Online Privacy Issues</h2>
						<p>As noted above, sometimes we collect personal information through our website (if you ask us to get in contact with you). This may be limited to some or all of the following information: your name, email address, telephone number and business contact details, such as your company name and your job title.</p>
						<p>We may also use cookies to monitor licensed user sessions of JOB ADDER'S recruitment management software Like most website providers, we may generate statistics about how many people visit our site and what they look at. We may use web logs and cookies to do this. This enables us to keep our site relevant and useful. However, generally this information will not identify you.</p>
						<p>Most web browsers are set by default to accept cookies. However, if you do not wish to receive cookies you may set your browser to either prompt or refuse cookies.</p>
						<h2>7. Additional Privacy Information and How to Contact JOB ADDER</h2>
						<p>This JOB ADDER Privacy Policy may change from time to time. The JOB ADDER Privacy Policy will be made available to anyone who requests it.</p>
