</p>
<p>
    <b>Links to Other Sites</b>
</p>
<p>
    The Websites may provide links to other websites which are not owned or controlled by the Publisher or its affiliates. Personal information and data from
    Users may be collected on these other websites when Users visit such websites and make use of the services provided therein. Where and when Users decide to
    click on any advertisement or hyperlink on the Site which grants Users access to another website, the protection of Users’ personal information and data
    which are deemed to be private and confidential may be exposed in these other websites.
</p>
<p>
    Non-registered Users who gain access to the Websites via their accounts in online social networking tools (including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter
    and Sina Weibo) are deemed to have consented to the terms of this Privacy Statement, and such Users' personal data which they have provided to those
    networking tools may be obtained by the Publisher and be used by the Publisher and its authorized persons in and outside of the User's country for the
    purpose of providing services and marketing materials to the Users. The Publisher and its authorised personnel may gain access and use the personal data of
    such Users so obtained, subject to the other provisions of this Privacy Statement.
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Statement is only applicable to the Websites. Users are reminded that this Privacy Statement grants no protection to Users’ personal
    information and data that may be exposed on websites other than the Website, and the Publisher is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other
    websites. Users are strongly recommended to refer to the privacy policies of such other websites before using those websites.
</p>
<p>
    <b> </b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Security</b>
</p>
<p>
    The security of Users’ personal information and data is important to the Publisher. The Publisher will always strive to ensure that Users’ personal
    information and data will be protected against unauthorised access. The Publisher has implemented appropriate electronic and managerial measures in order
    to safeguard, protect and secure Users’ personal information and data.
</p>
<p>
    All personal information and data provided by Users are only accessible by the authorised personnel of the Publisher or its authorised third parties, and
    such personnel shall be instructed to observe the terms of this Privacy Statement when accessing such personal information and data. Users may rest assured
    that their personal information and data will only be kept for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it is collected. Registered User
    should safeguard his/her unique Username and Password by keeping it secret and confidential and never share these details with anyone.
</p>
<p>
    The Publisher follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information and data submitted by Users to the Websites, both during
    transmission and once the Publisher receives it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
    Therefore, while the Publisher strives to protect Users’ personal information and data against unauthorised access, the Publisher cannot guarantee its
    absolute security.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Retention of Personal Data</b>
</p>
<p>
    Once the Publisher has obtained a User’s personal information and/or data, it will be maintained securely in the Publisher’s system for the period
    necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the data was collected as set out under the section headed “Purpose of Collection of Personal Data”. Once
    registered, Users may terminate his/her membership of the Website with the Publisher at whose contact details are set out under the section headed
    “Enquiries”. The Publisher may retain User’s personal information even after User’s has closed his/her account if retention is reasonably necessary to
