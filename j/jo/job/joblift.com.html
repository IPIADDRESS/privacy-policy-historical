The IP address transmitted by your browser in line with Bing Ads is not consolidated with other data from Bing. Furthermore, Bing complies with the privacy policies of the “EU-U.S. Privacy Shield” agreement. Bing uses this information on behalf of Joblift to analyse the use of the website, to compile reports on website activities for Joblift and to provide other services associated with the use of the website and Internet.
