			<a id="1" name="1"></a>What Information Do We Collect? 
		</u>
	</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<em>Personal Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us - </em>We only have access to and collect Personal Information (such as your name,
		 mailing or billing address, telephone number, email address, and email
		 preferences) that you voluntarily give us via email or through other direct
		 contact from you, such as when you register to use the Site, when you
		 complete a survey or enter a contest on the Site, or when you use any
		 chat room functionality of the Site. This Personal Information is collected
		 for the purpose of providing you with the services you request and responding
		 to inquiries you make through the Site. We use this Personal Information
		 as described below under the heading "How Do We Use Personal Information
		 That You Voluntarily Provide". We will use certain information collected
		 from your device that is not Personal Information in order to send you
		 information about our products and those of certain third parties, as
		 explained below. When we collect Personal Information from you, we will
		 provide you with the opportunity to refuse to receive product information
		 from (i) us or (ii) third parties. Should you opt to receive this product
		 information, you may change your mind for the future. For example, each
		 message you receive about a product will contain and easy to use "unsubscribe"
		 hyperlink.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Information Collected by Automated Means - </em>Whenever you use the Site, we, as well as any of our third-party advertisers
		 and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically
		 collect information about how you access and use the Site ("Usage
		 Information"). Usage Information may include, in part, your browser
		 type, your operating system, the time you spend on the Site, how many
		 times you visit the Site, and the website you visited immediately before
		 the Site. This Usage Information is collected for the purpose of providing
		 us with information about the use of the Site by you and other users,
		 such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long
		 they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click"
		 on. We use Usage Information to help us to keep the Site fresh and interesting
		 to visitors like you and to tailor content of the Site to your interests.
		 Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it
		 with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal
		 Information. By using the Site, you consent to our collection of Usage
		 Information from you.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Device Identifiers -</em> In the course of collecting Usage Information we may also collect your
		 IP address, MAC Address or other unique identifier (each a "Device
		 Identifier") for the computer, mobile device, Wi-Fi card, or other
		 technology (collectively, "Devices") you use to access the Site.
		 A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your
		 Device when you access a web site or its servers. Our computers identify
		 your Device by its Device Identifier. When you visit the Sites, we may
		 view your Device Identifier. We use your Device Identifier to identify
		 you when you visit our Site so that we can help ensure you have the best
		 possible experience in using our Site. We also may use your Device Identifier
		 to send you advertisements from third parties targeted to your interests.
		 If you want us to stop using your Device Identifiers to send you targeted
		 advertising, please follow the steps in the section below titled "How
		 to Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising." We may associate your Device
		 Identifier with your other Personal Information that you voluntarily provide
		 or that is automatically collected when you visit the Site. By using the
		 Site, you consent to our collection of your Device Identifier.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Site Cookies</em>
		<em>-</em> The technologies used on the Site, including Device Identifiers, to collect
		 Usage Information may include, without limitation: 
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>Cookies</em>
				<em>-</em> "Cookies" are data files placed on a Device when it is used
				 to visit the Site. We may use cookies to collect and store certain information
				 about you. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close
				 your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer
				 until you delete them).
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Web Beacons</em>
				<em>-</em> We may also include web beacons (also known as web bugs, Internet tags,
				 pixel tags, tracking pixels and clear GIFs) with the content and advertisements
				 that we deliver to you, which we will use to collect information regarding
				 your interaction with our content and advertisements appearing on our
				 Site. A "web beacon" is a transparent graphic image placed on
				 a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been
				 viewed or that an email has been forwarded. In addition, a web beacon
				 allows third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of
				 the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the
				 URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing
				 the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and
				 the information in cookies set by the third party. A web beacon may also
				 tell your browser to get content from another server.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>We use cookies and web beacons (together, "Site Cookies") to
	 gather information about how you use our Site. Information gathered through
	 Site Cookies may be considered Personal Information. We use this information
	 to track your interests in order to enhance your experience on our Site,
	 understand your interests and how you use our Site, and track the effectiveness
	 of advertisements on our Site. By using the Site, you consent to our collection
	 of your Personal Information using Site Cookies.</p>
<p><em>ReachLocal</em></p>
<p>We also work with a company called ReachLocal Canada, Inc. and its affiliates
	 and parent company in the United States of America (collectively, "ReachLocal"),
	 which assists us in advertising our products and/or services. One of the
	 products that we may purchase from ReachLocal is a retargeting product,
	 which enables ReachLocal to show you advertisements for our Site when
	 you visit other sites in the ReachLocal network or in third-party networks.
	 ReachLocal is able to do this through the use of cookies that are provided
	 by ReachLocal through its third-party partners ("Advertising Cookies").
	 The sole use of the Advertising Cookies is to show you advertisements
	 for our Site; they are not being used to target you or collect information
	 from you, including Personal Information, in any other way. Moreover,
	 ReachLocal does not link or otherwise connect the information in the Advertising
	 Cookies to any Personal Information that you may have provided to us.
	 Please note that ReachLocal retains the information on the ReachLocal
	 platform for purposes of quality assurance and campaign assessment.</p>
<p>
	If you have any questions regarding ReachLocal and/or the Advertising Cookies,
	 you are encouraged to contact ReachLocal at
	<a href="mailto:privacy@reachlocal.com">privacy@reachlocal.com</a>.
</p>
<p><em>Analytics</em></p>
<p>
	We may use two products to analyze activity on our Site. We use ReachLocal's
	 tracking technology and/or Google Analytics to understand how you use
	 our Site so that we can enhance your experience on our Site. In each case,
	 we provide your Personal Information to ReachLocal and your Device Identifiers
	 to Google for processing and analysis. By using the Site, you consent
	 to our transfer of your Personal Information and/or Device Identifiers
	 to, and the use of such information by, these third parties. If you wish
	 to opt-out of ReachLocal's tracking technologies, go to http://www.reachlocal.ca/trackingopt-out,
	 and if you wish to opt-out of Google Analytics, go to
	<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB</a>.

<h3><u>
		<a id="2" name="2"></a>How Do We Use Personal Information That You Voluntarily Provide? 
	</u></h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		<em>Registration -</em> You may need to first complete a registration form in order to use the
		 Site. During registration, you may be required to provide us with certain

	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Surveys and contests - </em>From time to time, our Site may request information via surveys or contests.
		 Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and
		 you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore provide us
		 with Personal Information. Information requested may include contact information
		 (such as your name and shipping address), and demographic information
		 (such as your postal code and age). Contact information will be used to
		 notify the winners and award prizes, while demographic information will
		 be used to confirm your contest and survey eligibility. Information gathered

	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Customer Service - </em>With your express consent only, we may contact you via email in the future
		 to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this Policy.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Chat -</em> Our Site may use chat functionality to enable us to directly communicate
		 with you through our Site. We will primarily use such information collected
		 through chat functions to assess your needs regarding our products or
		 services and to collect your contact information so that we may contact
		 you to further discuss our products or services.
	</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>
		<a id="3" name="3"></a>Do We Share Your Information? 
	</u></h3>
<p>As described above, we share your Personal Information and Device Identifiers
	 with Google and ReachLocal for processing and analysis so that they can
	 help us understand how you use our Site so that we can enhance your experience
	 on our Site. We may also share your Device Identifiers with third parties
	 which will allow those third parties to send you advertisements targeted
	 to your interests.</p>
<p>Except as described in the paragraph above, unless you ask or provide your
	 consent to do so, we will not share your Personal Information with any
	 third party outside of our organization, other than with our service providers
	 and then only as is necessary to fulfill your request (e.g., to ship an
	 order). Only employees of our organization and our service providers who
	 need access to your Personal Information to perform a specific job (for
	 example, billing or customer service) are granted access to your Personal
	 Information. We make our employee aware of the importance of protecting
	 your Personal Information.</p>
<p>We may share anonymous, aggregated, demographic information about Site
	 users with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked, and cannot
	 be linked, to any Personal Information that can identify any individual person.</p>
<p>We will disclose Personal Information to a third party when we believe

<h3><u>
		<a id="5" name="5"></a>How to Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising 
	</u></h3>
<p>
	You can set most web browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or
	 you may choose to block cookies, though either of those actions may affect
	 your use of our Site. If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising,
	 you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information.
	 For example, by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Opt-Out Page at
	<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>, you can opt-out of some or all of the ads sponsored by some or all of
	 the Alliance members. Please note that even if you choose to remove your
	 information (via opting out), you will still see advertisements while
	 you are browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less
	 relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising
	 programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have
	 compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories
	 help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The
	 DAA Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies
	 that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies'
	 pages where you can opt-out of receiving targeted advertisements from
	 those companies.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, if you wish to opt out of any of the Advertising Cookies,
	 you can do this simply by navigating to
	<a href="http://www.reachlocal.ca/opt-out">http://www.reachlocal.ca/opt-out</a>, which will take you to a web page where you will be able to opt out of
	 the Advertising Cookies currently used in connection with ReachLocal's
	 remarketing product and our Site.

	 The computers and servers in which we store and process your Personal
