<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<div id="cushion">


<div id="content">

<p>
This privacy policy is effective as of January 3, 2014. JobsOnline
respects the privacy of consumers. JobsOnline will not knowingly
disclose personally identifiable information about its consumers to
any third party advertiser other than as set forth in this privacy
policy.
</p>

<p>
JobsOnline provides information on many topics. Some of this 
information is created by JobsOnline, and some of it is created 
by third parties, including information produced by the U.S. 
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics and information 
from the O*NET<sup style="font-size: 80%">TM</sup> database. While our site strives to provide accurate 
expert advice, commentary and other information, JobsOnline does 
not make any warranty regarding the accuracy, reliability or use 
of any information provided on this site. 
</p>

<p>
JobsOnline and third parties may use "cookies", "tokens", "web beacons" or similar technologies to help you
personalize your online experience. Third-parties may use information
about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide
advertisements about goods and services of interest to you and, in
such event, you would be subject to such third-party's privacy
policy. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a
Web page server. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide
a convenience feature to save you time. You have the ability to accept
or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies,
but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if
you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to
fully experience the interactive features of JobsOnline. 

A token may be placed on the devices in which you use to access 
JobsOnline for purposes of identifying the device.

Our Web pages
may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called
single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count users who have visited those
pages and to deliver special services.
</p>

<p>
We may share information with third parties, and allow third parties to use 
cookies or web beacons to collect information about you, in connection with 
providing you information about products and services that might be of interest 
to you.  These authorized third parties may link your name, address and e-mail 
address to other information which they collect, such as past online/offline 
purchase information and Web usage from other sites. </p>

<p>
Cookies are text files that are placed on a Web site's visitor browser. We and 
our authorized third party partners, and their partners, may use cookies, tokens, web 
beacons or similar technologies on our site and emails to identify and deliver more relevant 
advertising to consumers. All of these technologies perform important and useful 
functions: they make it possible to provide personalized pages for visitors; 
they help advertisers avoid repeatedly serving the same ads to the same visitor; 
they help website owners determine which sections of their sites are more 
appealing; and, they help advertisers learn which advertisements are of interest 
to our customers on the Web. To trigger these technologies, we may pass information, 
which may include your name, address and email address, to a Web advertising 
partner, who may place a cookie or token on your device. Turning off the browser's 
cookies will prevent web beacons and cookies from measuring the relevance and 
effectiveness of our site, emails and advertising as well as the tailored 
advertising brought to you by our partners. You may also not be able to use all 
the interactive features of our site and emails if cookies are disabled.

Notwithstanding any other provision, we may also engage data providers who may 
collect web log data from you (including IP address and information about your 
browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your 
browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These cookies may 
or may not contain personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect 
demographic (identified or de-identified) or other data linked to data you 
voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with 
a data provider which may or may not be in hashed, non-human readable form.

To learn more about these practices or if you no longer wish to receive tailored 
advertisements from third party advertising networks, please visit
