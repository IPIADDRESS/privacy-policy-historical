<h3><strong>Online Applications</strong></h3>
<p>Making an online application to a job advertisement on Jora is a free and optional service that does not require registration as a Registered User. When you choose to apply to a position advertised on our site, your application may be processed in one of two ways:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; i. Where the Advertisement has been directly placed on the Site, your application (including any attachments and cover letters) will be processed by Jora and forwarded directly on to the Advertiser or its nominated representative; or</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ii. In other instances, when you apply, you will be directed to an external website over which Jora has no control and your application (including any attachments and cover letters) will be processed directly by that Advertiser and their website. &nbsp;These applications are not processed by Jora and the use of your information (personal or otherwise) by these Advertisers and any associated website is not within the control of Jora and we cannot accept, and expressly disclaim, all responsibility for the conduct of these companies.</p>
<p>Any questions you have relating to a position advertised on Jora, your online application and/or the status of your application should be directed directly to the Advertiser or their nominated agent, not Jora. You also have the right to directly contact Advertisers to request access to any personal information that you or Jora has sent to them as part of an application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where your application is processed by Jora, you, or Jora on your behalf, may be required to obtain information from an independent 3rd party relating to job application criteria set by the Advertiser (such as a National Police Check) (“<strong>3rd Party Sourced PI</strong>”). In these instances you consent to:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; i. where applicable, Jora obtaining such 3rd Party Sourced PI and passing this information onto the relevant Advertiser;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ii. Jora passing such 3rd Party Sourced PI provide directly by you to us on to the relevant Advertiser; and</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; iii. Jora retaining copies of all 3rd Party Sourced PI and where you have a Jora profile, Jora supplementing that Profile with details of that 3rd Party Sourced PI which can be edited by you at any time. Where we include this information in your profile, we will send you an email notifying you of this.</p>

However, Jora will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access of your personal information.</p>
