        <p>NHS Jobs has an interface to the Electronic Staff Record System (ESR) which is a payroll and human resources system used by most NHS organisations and by a number of other organisations providing NHS services. The data you submit to NHS Jobs may be transferred to ESR for the purposes of: establishing the human resources and payroll record; completing the recruitment process or parts of the process on ESR; or for reporting purposes such as equal opportunity monitoring.</p>
        <p>The data you submit to NHS Jobs as part of your job application may be downloaded and transferred to the employers' own system or a third party system where an employer chooses to complete the recruitment process using a different system.</p>
        <p>If you apply for a job on NHS Jobs then the employer which advertised the job will have access to your application and any other material you submit in support of the application for example, your accompanying CV. Employers may copy and hold some or all of this data locally in their own systems to facilitate their administration of the recruitment exercise.</p>
        <p>An employing organisation has an obligation to inform you how they are processing your application before you apply including but not limited to:</p>
