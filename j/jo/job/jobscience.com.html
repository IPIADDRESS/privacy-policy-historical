<p>Jobscience is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and is used only for the purposes as set forth herein. The following reflects our commitment to you.</p>
<h3>Information About All Jobscience Visitors</h3>
<p>In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. We only use such data in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for our users. We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how Jobscience users, collectively, use career areas and our site, so they may create a better overall experience for you, as well.</p>
<h3>Information About You Specifically</h3>
<p>In some instances, such as when you sign up to use a service, enter into a contest, or purchase a product, we may need more specific information about you, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, type of computer, etc. We may use that information to make you aware of additional products and services which may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site changes. We may also ask you for other information, such as information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience.</p>
<h3>General Information Disclosure</h3>
<p>We do not disclose information about your individual visits to Jobscience. But, we may record and share aggregated information with our partners. Also, if you input your information on a co-branded registration page, such as that of a Jobscience and partner company-sponsored contest, then your information becomes the property of both Jobscience and the partner co-sponsoring the contest. In that instance, Jobscience is not responsible for the information that the partner company receives.</p>
<h3>Resumes</h3>
<p>Since Jobscience is a career site, we give you the option of putting your resume in our database. Your resume, with the exception of any personal contact information, will be searchable by all recruiters who pay for access to our resume database product. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to paying recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals. However, we are not responsible if some other third party, such as someone posing as the aforementioned and paying for the service, evades security measures and gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your resume. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances.</p>
<h3>Privacy Commitment Changes</h3>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy commitment for Jobscience, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about Jobscience?s privacy commitment, please feel free to call (866) 284-1892 and speak to one of our representatives.</p>

If there is a conflict between the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the Safe Harbor Principles, the Safe Harbor Principles will govern.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>The following definitions apply to all statements throughout this Privacy Policy.</p>

Personal information does not include information that pertains to or is about a specific individual, but from which that individual could not reasonably be identified.</p>
<p>"Sensitive personal information" means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or that concerns health or sex life. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, Jobscience will treat as sensitive personal information any information received from a third party where that third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive.</p>

    <li>The information in question is publicly available;</li>
    <li>The disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or defense of legal claims; or</li>
    <li>The disclosure is to another Jobscience entity or to persons or entities providing services on Jobscience's or the individual's behalf (each a "transferee"), consistent with the purpose for which the information was obtained, if the transferee, with respect to the information in question:

<p>Permitted transfers of information, whether to third parties or within Jobscience, include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction to another, including transfers to and from the U.S. Because privacy laws vary from one jurisdiction to another, personal information may be transferred to a jurisdiction where the laws provide less or different protection than the jurisdiction in which the information originated.</p>
<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use and confidentiality of information, either for its own purposes or on behalf of its clients, customers and business partners, Jobscience has put in place and rigorously enforces appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information that Jobscience processes. However, Jobscience cannot guarantee the security of information on or transmitted via the Internet.</p>
<h3>Data Integrity</h3>
<p>Jobscience processes personal information only in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for such purposes, Jobscience takes reasonable steps to make sure that personal information is accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable for its intended use.</p>
<h3>Access and Correction</h3>
<p>If an individual becomes aware that information Jobscience maintains about that individual is inaccurate, or if an individual would like to update or review that individual's information, the individual may contact Jobscience using the contact information below. In every case, Jobscience will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate. The individual seeking to amend such information will need to provide sufficient identifying information, such as name, address, birth date, and social security number. Jobscience may request additional identifying information as a security precaution. In addition, Jobscience may limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Agreement. In some circumstances, Jobscience may charge a reasonable fee, where warranted, for access to personal information.</p>
<h3>Enforcement and Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>Jobscience utilizes the self-assessment approach to assure its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Jobscience periodically verifies that this Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles. Jobscience encourages interested persons to raise any concerns about its implementation of this Privacy Policy using the contact information below. Jobscience will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Any claim arising out of or relating to Jobscience's adherence to the EU Data Directive, or the breach thereof, that cannot be resolved through Jobscience's internal processes, will be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its applicable commercial rules. Any arbitrator will be either an attorney or retired judge having significant and recognized experience with and knowledge of privacy issues and information technology. The arbitration panel should apply Texas law, without regard to its conflict of laws principles, as well as the Safe Harbor Enforcement Principles issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce. In addition, the exclusive location for such arbitration will be Houston, Texas. All decisions of the arbitration panel will be final and binding on the parties, which waive any right to appeal the arbitration award further, to the extent an appeal may be lawfully waived.</p>
<p>Jobscience is also subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>Jobscience may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, consistent with the requirements of the Safe Harbor Principles or the United States Department of Commerce. Jobscience will post any revised privacy policy in its work places, train its employees about such changes and how to comply with them, and will publish any amended privacy policy on this Web site or a similar Web site that replaces this Web site.</p>

<h2>Information Subject To Other Policies Or Standards</h2>
<p>Jobscience is committed to following the Safe Harbor Principles for all personal information within the scope of the Safe Harbor Agreement. Certain information, however, is subject to policies of Jobscience that may differ in some respects from the provisions of this Privacy Policy. Information subject to such additional policies includes information obtained from or relating to a client, customer or business partner or former client, customer or business partner that is subject to the terms of any privacy notice to or agreement with such client, customer or business partner, any engagement letter or letters with such client, customer or business partner, and applicable laws and professional standards.</p>
