              <li>Besides that, you may also opt for making your resume searchable by companies who use the <b>JobStreet.com</b> "Searchable Resume Database" to recruit. The companies may retain a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.

We provide the information only to trusted business partners who work with us or on our behalf under confidentiality agreements.

            <br>
            In both cases described above, you will be asked to make your requests while logged into a MyJobStreet account, so that <b>JobStreet.com</b> can associate your preferences with a particular service. This security safeguard prevents someone else from making choices about the usage and control of your personal information. If you do not have a MyJobStreet account, you can create one now by <a href="http://myjobstreet.jobstreet.com.my/registration/registration.asp">clicking here</a>. <br>

            <br>
            However, there are some <b>JobStreet.com</b> services that send out periodic emails to inform you of technical service issues, product surveys, new feature announcements and news about our products and services. You will be unable to unsubscribe from these emails as they are considered an integral part of the service you have chosen. <br>
