			Generally, we collect personal information that is needed to facilitate and to provide the services and products offered

		<p>
			The types of personal information that we collect from you will depend on ‚Äì

			For example, when you register with us, we may collect details such as your name, address, telephone numbers and other

			membership of a political or trade association, sexual preferences or health) and would not do so without your consent.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, there may be instances where such information becomes necessary or is part of a curriculum vitae. &nbsp;In such
			an event, the law requires us to obtain your consent to the collection of ‚Äúsensitive information‚Äù. If you
			provide us with this information, we will assume that you have consented to the collection of that information for use in
			accordance with this Privacy Charter unless you expressly inform us otherwise.&nbsp; Please note that if you choose not to

			information from market research companies, contracted by us to obtain information so that we may improve and market
			our products and services.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>How We Store information</strong></h3>
		<p>
			We store personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper based files and other records.

		</p>

		<h3><strong>How We Use Your Personal Information</strong> </h3>

			or out‚Äìof‚Äìdate, please contact us and we will take all reasonable steps to correct this information.&nbsp; Also, if

		<h3><strong>Disclosure of your personal information to third parties</strong></h3>
		<p>
			We may disclose your personal information to third parties in the following circumstances ‚Äì
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>    if required to do so or permitted by law;</li>
			<li>    to various regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials and agencies to protect against fraud and for security purposes;</li>
			<li>    to our third party service providers as well as to our related entities, for the purposes of providing the services and/or products you request or purchase from us;</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<p>
			Where we engage third party contractors to perform services for us, those third party contractors may be given access to your personal
			information for the purposes of providing services to us.&nbsp; Under these circumstances however, those third party contractors must
			safeguard this information and must only use it for the purposes for which it was supplied.&nbsp; If we give a third party service
			provider your personal information, we will also make them aware of this Privacy Charter and ask that they handle your personal
			information in accordance with it.&nbsp; However, beyond this, we will not be liable if they do not comply with this Privacy Charter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other than as described in this section, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent unless
		disclosure is&nbsp;‚Äì
		</p>
		<p>(a) necessary to prevent a threat to life or health;</p>
		<p>(b) reasonably necessary to enforce any matter; or</p>
		<p>(c) necessary to investigate a suspected unlawful activity</p>

		<h3><strong>Trans‚ÄìBorder Data Flows</strong></h3>
		<p>
			For the purposes of providing our services to you, it may be necessary for us to forward personal information to relevant overseas
			service providers.&nbsp; We will always ask for your consent at the time of collecting your personal information to allow us to
			provide your personal information to overseas entities for the purpose of providing our services to you.&nbsp; Please let us know
			if you have any objections to such transfers of information.&nbsp; However, we note that we may be not be able to provide you with
			the products and/or services requested if you object to such trans‚Äìborder data flows.
		</p>


		<h3><strong>Links to other websites</strong></h3>
		<p>
			Our Site contains links to other websites.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other
			websites. You are responsible for reading the privacy statements and policies of any linked sites as their privacy policies may
			differ from ours.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>Security</strong> </h3>
		<p>
			We have adopted appropriate security features in order to protect and keep secure personal information from loss, misuse, alteration
			or destruction.&nbsp; We regularly review our security and encryption technologies and strive to protect personal information to the
			highest level possible.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>SSL </strong><strong>Technology</strong></h3>
		<p>
			We employ Secure Service Layer (SSL) Technology whenever any transaction is completed over our Site. Indeed, transactions involving
			the passage of personal information occur in one of our secure online areas only.&nbsp; SSL technology encrypts the information you
			send through our Site.&nbsp; The use of SSL technology requires two components ‚Äì
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>An SSL‚Äìcompatible browser; and</li>
			<li>A web server to perform ‚Äúkey‚Äìexchange‚Äù that establishes a secure connection.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<p>
			For you to benefit from the SSL Technology which we have implemented:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>you will need a browser with SSL capabilities.&nbsp; The latest versions of commonly used web browsers generally have this
				capability.&nbsp; However, it is your responsibility to check that this is the case.&nbsp; If you do not already have a browser
				with SSL capabilities, you can download an SSL browser from a vendor's website.</li>
			<li>You will also need an internet service provider that enables SSL technology. Nearly all internet service providers automatically
				enable SSL technology, but you will need to ensure that this is the case with your service provider.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<p>
			jobsjobsjobs Limited makes no warranty or representation in respect of the strength or effectiveness of the encryption capabilities
			of SSL Technology and jobsjobsjobs Limited is not responsible in any way for events arising from any unauthorised access of the
			information you provide.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>Tracking activity on our websites</strong></h3>
		<p>
			When you browse the Site and have not registered for any online products or services, you browse anonymously.&nbsp; Personally
			identifiable information ‚Äì such as your name, address, telephone number and email address ‚Äì is not collected as you
			browse.&nbsp; However, we track how our Site is used by both anonymous visitors and our registered customers, by using a small
			string of text that is sent to your browser known as a ‚Äòcookie‚Äô. Our use of cookies is described in more detail in the
			next section.
		</p>


		<h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>
		<p>
			Cookies collect information that include the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type and how you gained entry to
			the Site.&nbsp; Therefore, when you visit the Site anonymously, details are recorded about your visit, such as how you have used
			the Site, the time and date of your access to the Site, pages of the Site that you accessed and the time you spent on the Site.
			&nbsp; This information is used in an anonymous form for statistical purposes and as such, cannot be used to identify you
			individually. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses or capture your email address
			or any other personally identifiable information.&nbsp; You should note that accepting cookies is required if you want to view
			our Site, because they are essential for our Site administration and security.
