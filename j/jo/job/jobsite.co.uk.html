<p>However, due to the nature of our global business and the technologies required, your Personal Information may be transferred to third party service providers outside the EEA, in countries where there may be a lower legal level of data protection.

<h3><strong>How can you manage or delete Personal Information?</strong></h3>

<p>Your CV can be viewed by Totaljobs and Jobsite customers, or customers of the StepStone Group, if you have consented to this within the profile section. This is the default setting. Further, when your profile is searchable your application activity (eg. number of applications, job titles, locations &amp; salaries) will be visible to Jobsite , Totaljobs and StepStone Group customers. This is also the default setting.</p>
<p>Please note that Jobsite reserves the right to remove from our database, CVs which include any content that we consider to be illegal or offensive. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your "My Account".&nbsp;</p>

<ul>

</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you use the Jobsite App we will ask you if you want to use our geolocation service. This service is provided by Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited.
