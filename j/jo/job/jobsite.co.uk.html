							<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="1">As a recruitment website, we give you the option of putting your CV in our database. There are two ways of doing this. You may store your CV in our database and hide it. Hiding your CV means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but recruiters will not have access to search it.</font></p>
							<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="1">Alternatively, you can store your CV in our database and allow it to be searchable. If you allow your CV to be searchable, then all recruitment agencies who pay for access to our CV services will have access to your CV. To protect your interests, Jobsite UK (Worldwide) Ltd does not allow direct employers access to our CV Services.</font></p>
							<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="1">We use our best efforts to grant access to our CV services only to paying recruitment agencies. However, we are not responsible if some other third party, such as someone posing as a recruitment agency and paying for the service, gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your CV.</font></p>
							<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="1">Equally, our terms and conditions prohibit any CV forwarded by Jobsite UK (Worldwide) Ltd from being forwarded to any third party except, with your permission, to an employer with the express intention of gaining you employment. If any recruitment agency is found to be breaching this condition, then we will immediately terminate their use of Jobsite's services. A link to our client terms and conditions may be found at the bottom of this page.</font></p>
							<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="1">You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time. However, recruitment agencies who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your CV in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of CV in these instances.</font></p>
