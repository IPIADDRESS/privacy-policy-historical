		Protection of Your CV </font> 
		<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We regard your CV 
		  as a very personal document and we wish you to have full control over 
		  who can view it and whether or not you wish to have your contact details 
		  (name, address, telephone number, email address etc) visible to recruiters.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">As an operator of 
		  a number of international recruitment websites, we give you the option 
		  of putting your CV in our searchable database which is a significant 
		  aid to quickly finding employment. We provide you a choice in how you 
		  do this. The choice allows you to select the level of confidentiality 
		  that you believe is appropriate.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The level of control 
		  is provided to you by your choice of whether to make your CV searchable 
		  by our Clients or not. Making your CV searchable considerably increases 
		  your exposure to potential employers. To prevent your CV from being 
		  searched and viewed by our Clients you should choose to "hide" 
		  your CV during the registration process. Choosing "hide" means 
		  that your CV is not accessible by any recruiter but you can gain access 
		  to it and use it when applying for individual jobs.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We use our best 
		  efforts to limit access to our CV services to recruiters who agree to 
		  abide by our terms and conditions. If any recruiter is found to be breaching 
		  these terms and conditions, then we will immediately terminate their 
		  use of GoJobsite's services. A link to our client terms and conditions 
		  may be found at the bottom of this page. <br>
		  You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time. However, 
		  recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained 
		  a copy of your CV in their own files or databases. We are not responsible 
		  for the retention, use, or privacy of your CV by recruiters in these 
		  instances.</font></p>

		<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The Jobs by Email 
		  service matches a job seekers requirements for employment with the profile 
		  of vacancies advertised on any one of our Sites. For job seekers who 
		  subscribe to this service you receive an email listing those jobs that 
		  we believe you should be interested in. Your requirements are defined 
		  by you using "strings" which can be used to specify geographic 
		  region, specific job titles, skills or other definition of the job you 
		  want. You can change the strings at any time or unsubscribe at any time.</font></p>
