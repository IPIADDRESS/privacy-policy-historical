<h1><span style="margin:0px 0px 20px;">Privacy Policy</span></h1>

<p>By <a href="/onlinejobsearchguide/online-job-search-expert-Susan-P-Joyce.shtml">Susan P. Joyce</a></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is provided by NETability, Inc. (“us” or “we”), the owner and operator of JOB-HUNT.ORG (the “Site”) in order to clarify our practices regarding the collection, storage, use and disclosure of information gathered by us and the choices available to you regarding the collection and use of your personal information.  By visiting the Site, you are confirming that you have read, understood and consent to our practices in collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information.</p>
<p> We are committed to being a trustworthy partner in your job search. You can visit Job-Hunt.Org as often as you want without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.</p>

IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
 
<h3>Information Collected Actively</h3>

<p><strong>Advertisers/Sponsors: </strong></p>

<p>We practice transparency in revenue generation. Revenue-generating links are identified as "Advertisement" or "Sponsor" or are across the top of a page or in the column on the right side of Job-Hunt pages.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to Job-Hunt.<br>

    </li>
  <li>Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting Ads Settings. (Alternatively, opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest based advertising by visiting aboutads.info.)</li>
  <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies" title="How Google uses cookies" target="_blank">How Google uses cookies</a> (https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies) explains Google's process -- the types of cookies used by Google, managing cookies in your browser, how Google retains collected data, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note that the use of ads on the Site enable it to be available for free to all users.</em></p>
<p>Please be aware that if you use an external link from the Site to an advertiser’s or sponsor’s site (each, a “Sponsor Website”), this Privacy Policy does not apply to any such Sponsor Website.  Your browsing or other activities on any third-party website, including those linked to the Site, are subject to such third party’s own rules and policies which may differ from this Privacy Policy.  We are not responsible for any activities and practices by each Sponsor Website, including the information or content provided thereon.  By accessing or using the Site, you are agreeing that we are not responsible for, and we do not exercise control over, any third-parties with whom you may come into contact with or engage in a transaction with as a direct or indirect result of your access of use of the Site, including, but not limited to sponsors and advertisers.</p>

<h3>Outside Links:</h3>

<p><strong>This privacy statement applies solely to Job-Hunt.Org.</strong></p>
<p>  The Site contains links to other sites operated by third parties. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. Job-Hunt.Org is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Before adding those sites to Job-Hunt's categorized lists of links, each site is evaluated to see if they protect the privacy of their visitors and, particularly, their job applicants.

<p>No personally identifiable information (i.e. e-mail addresses of newsletter subscribers) will be intentionally shared with any third party unless such disclosure is required by law or a summons or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to:</p>
<ul>

<h3>Cookies:</h3>

<p>When you access the Site, we or our third party partners and advertisers may send one or more cookies to your computer.
