                        <h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>
                        <p>When you register with this site or one of the web sites in our network (collectively, the "Beyond Network" or the "Site"), we ask you for personal information, such as your name, phone number, and email address. We use this information to process your requests, to communicate with you about the status of your requests, and to review and improve the service we provide to you. We may also use your email address to send you information about your account, such as newsletters to which you are subscribed during registration, as well as messages about any special offers, promotional announcements and consumer surveys, Beyond services, account updates, services that may be of interest to you, or administrative messages regarding your account.  You can manage your email list options under your user account settings.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we may send job alert and other relevant text messages to your mobile phone number if you provide your mobile phone number and request these text alerts when you register with our Site.  Shortly after opting-in to this alert feature, you will receive a text welcome message.  You can opt-out of receiving these alerts by texting "STOP" to the shortcode from which you're receiving alerts.   You will receive a confirmation text that you have opted-out.  You also can manage whether to receive text alerts under your user account settings at any time.  You understand that if you opt-in to receive text alerts, we may share your mobile phone number with our clients and partners solely so they may also send you job alerts and other relevant text messages.</p>
                        <p>By registering on or using our Site, you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to our partners and affiliates. Beyond does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with third parties or non-affiliated companies, except as otherwise disclosed in this policy, or under the following circumstances:</p>
                        <p>We disclose information:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>to companies and individuals we employ to perform services on our behalf,</li>
                            <li>if legally required to do so,</li>
                            <li>to protect the rights or property of the Beyond Network or our affiliated companies, or</li>
                            <li>to protect the personal safety of users or the general public.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Additionally, information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership of our company.</p>
                        <p>In order to serve you better and more efficiently, we may also share anonymous aggregated information about users with our partners and other third parties.</p>
                        <p>We collect information from our users at several different points on the Site. When you first register with us, we ask for your email address. At this time, we may subscribe you to various email publications. You can unsubscribe from any or all publications at any time. If you are a registered member, <a href="/home">click here</a> to access your account and manage your email options. We will delete data on our Site that you have provided to us, upon request, through our <a href="/JS/Form/ContactUsForm.asp">Contact Us form</a>.</p>
                        <p>We also offer an affiliate program, where affiliate members direct customers to the Beyond Network through links on their Web sites. We ask affiliates for information, including their site name (URL), mailing address, primary contact, pay-to address, technical contact, and other site-related information, to determine whether a site will be included in our network. The information collected from our affiliates is used strictly for our affiliate program; none of this information is used for general marketing purposes.</p>
                        <p>In some cases our software and Site are utilized by our partners in a business alliance via their web community. In these cases, the information collected on our Site is available to both companies.</p>
                        <p>You should be aware that any personal information (such as email address or resumes), which you voluntarily display or distribute on the Beyond Network and on the Internet can be collected and used by others, no different than posting this information in a newspaper. This may result in your receiving unsolicited messages from third parties for which Beyond.com is not responsible and has no ability to affect.  If you click on a third party job posting and provide that party with your personal information, we have no responsibility or control over that information.</p>

                        <p>We have implemented technology and security features, as well as strict internal guidelines, to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from unauthorized access or improper use. We will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available. While we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
                        <p>When you place an order online at the Beyond Network, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. This Site uses a service company to process its credit card transactions.</p>
                        <p>Users should not post personal information to any site if they are uncomfortable with the security of the site. If you have any questions, please contact us.</p>
