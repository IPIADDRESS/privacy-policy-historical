    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <p>Juju takes your privacy very seriously and has created this Privacy
    Policy to explain the various ways in which we use the data we collect. By
    using the Juju website, or submitting information to us by other means,
    you are subjecting your information to the practices outlined in this
    Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers Juju's treatment of personal
    information that we collect when you are on Juju’s website and when you
    use Juju’s services. This policy does not apply to the practices of
    third parties that Juju does not own or control, including websites that
    we may link to, or to individuals that Juju does not employ or manage.</p>
    
    <h2>Information That Juju Collects</h2>
    
    <p>Juju collects personal information that allows us to provide you with a
    full range of customized services. The information that we collect from
    our users includes the following:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Information That You Provide:</strong> Juju collects and
    retains any information that you enter on our website or provide to us in
    any other way, including information regarding your job search and your
    background. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but
    doing so may limit your ability to use our site or particular features and
    services that we offer.</p>
    
    <ul style="margin-left: 2em; list-style-type: disc;">

        jobs that match your search criteria, updates about new
        features and services, or other notifications that you
        request, we require that you provide us your email address and
        notification preferences (example: search keywords and
        location).</li>
        
        <li>Registration: In order to use certain Juju services, you

        search effectively, we enable you to provide and store
        information about yourself, such as saved searches, bookmarks,
        and preferences.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p style="margin-top: 1em"><strong>Information That We Collect
    Automatically:</strong> Juju and its authorized agents automatically
    collect and retain certain types of information whenever you interact with
    Juju’s website and services, which includes data provided by your
    browser or email program, such as your IP address, Juju cookies, http
    referer, and the pages you request. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers
    that your Web browser stores on your computer's hard drive when you access
    Juju’s website and services. Juju uses cookies to enable our systems to
    recognize your browser and record how and when our website and services
    are utilized. Most Web browsers allow users to receive notification when
    new cookies are set, specify which cookies to accept and reject, or
    disable cookies entirely (consult your browser’s “Help” menu for
    guidance on adjusting your settings). We recommend that you accept all
    cookies from Juju because turning them off may prevent or impair your
    access to our website and services. Some of Juju’s business partners and
    advertisers may transfer cookies to your browser when you use our website
    and services. We do not control or have access to these cookies.</p>
    
    <h3>Affiliated Sites</h3>
    
    <p>Juju offers some of our services in connection with other websites.
    Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to us in
    order to deliver our services to you. We collect, retain and process such
    information from affiliated sites in accordance with this Policy.
    Affiliated sites may have different privacy practices than Juju and we
    encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>
    
    <h3>Children</h3>
    
    <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to register to use the Juju
    website. Juju is not intended for children under 13 years of age. Juju
    does not knowingly collect personal information about children under the
    age of 13. If we learn that Juju has received information from a child
    under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as
    possible. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 17 ask and
    receive their parents' permission before using Juju or sending information
    about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.</p>
    
    <h2>Use of Your Personal Information</h2>
    
    <p>Juju uses your personal information as described below:</p>
    
    <ul style="margin-left: 2em; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Juju uses the personal information that we collect to provide you with our
        products and services, including the display of customized content and
        advertising. That includes use for auditing, research and analysis for the
        purposes of maintaining, protecting and improving our services; developing new
        services; and ensuring the proper functioning of our systems and
        infrastructure.</li>
        
        <li>We may combine the information you submit under your Juju account with
        information from other Juju services or third parties in order to provide you
        with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.</li>
        
        <li>Juju processes personal information on our servers in the United States of
        America. In some cases, that may mean that we process personal information on
        a server outside your own country.</li>
        
        <li>Juju’s employees, consultants, and contractors may have access to your
        personal information if necessary in the normal course of our business
        operations.</li>
        
        <li>Juju may provide your personal information to third parties that we have
        contracted with to help us deliver services or process data (such as email
        delivery or transaction processing). In these cases, we only disclose
        information to the extent we deem necessary to achieve the purpose at hand and
        use service providers that have provided assurances about the security and
        confidentiality of the data that we share.</li>
        
        <li>Juju may share certain aggregated, non-personal information with third
        parties for marketing and other purposes, such as the number of visitors to
        our website, the search terms that those visitors used, or the number of times
        users clicked a particular advertisement. Such aggregated, non-personal
        information does not identify you individually.</li>
        
        <li>If Juju, or any portion of its assets, is acquired by a third party, the
        information we have collected and stored may be among the assets transferred
        to the acquiring party.</li>
        
        <li>We may release personal information if we believe that doing so is
        necessary to comply with a law, court order or subpoena; enforce or apply our
        Terms of Use or other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety
        of Juju, our employees, our users, or others.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p style="margin-top: 1em">Juju has implemented procedural and technological measures intended to
    secure your personal information from accidental loss and from
    unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, Juju cannot guarantee
    that unauthorized persons will not be able to defeat those measures or use
    your personal information improperly. You are responsible for the security
    of your Juju username and password. We strongly recommend that you never
    share your Juju login information with others and that you protect
    yourself against unauthorized access to your account by logging off once
    you have finished using any computer that is accessible to others. For
    your convenience, Juju allows you to manage your email alert settings and
    preferences (such as search keywords and location) via links included in
    emails that we send to your inbox, and do not require a username or
    password to view alert information or change settings. If you share a Juju
    email alert, the recipient will be able to access your alert settings and
    preferences.</p>
    
    <h2>Email Communications</h2>
    
    <p>Juju respects your email preferences and will never provide your email
    address to a third party without your permission, except under the limited
    circumstances described in the "Use of Your Personal Information" section
    above. If you provide us your email address, Juju may email you job
    alerts, account notifications, news, offers, surveys or promotions, and
    other communications. If you do not want to receive particular types of
    email from Juju, follow the instructions contained in any unwanted email
    messages to notify us of your preferences. However, please note that you
    may continue to receive administrative emails (such as responses to
    forgotten password requests) and legal notices from us as long as you
    remain a registered user or utilize our website or services.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Control Your Information</h2>
    
    <ul style="margin-left: 2em; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>You can choose not to disclose information to Juju, although doing so may
        limit or impair your access to our website and services.</li>
        
        <li>You can modify your email preferences to restrict or eliminate email from
        Juju, subject to the limitations related to administrative emails and legal
        notices described in the Email Communications section above. </li>
        
        <li>You can control how your browser handles cookies from Juju, although
        disabling cookies from Juju may limit or impair your access to our website and
        services.</li>
        
        <li>You can update your information at any time on our website. However, note
        that when you do so we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our
        records.</li>
        
        <li>You can request deletion of your Juju account by <a href="/contact/">contacting us</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 style="margin-top: 1em">Protect Yourself from Scams</h2>
    
    <p>Juju uses automated processes to collect and present information that
    has been created by third parties, so we cannot assure the accuracy or
    legitimacy of that information. We strongly recommend that you exercise
    caution when providing information about yourself to others online,
    including when you apply for jobs found via Juju. To protect yourself, we
    suggest the following:</p>
    
    <ul style="margin-left: 2em; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Never provide your social security number, credit card
        information, bank account details, or unnecessary personal information
        to a potential employer.</li>
        
        <li>Never participate in a financial transaction of any sort with a
        potential employer.</li>
        
        <li>Always be cautious of opportunities that sound too good to be true
        or require you to act as a financial intermediary, particularly for an
        overseas person.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <p>Juju may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole
    discretion. Use of information we collect from time to time is subject to
    the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we
    make changes to our Privacy Policy, we will provide notification by
    posting an announcement on the Juju website so you can monitor the types
    of information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if
    any, it is disclosed. It is your responsibility to review our current
    Privacy Policy to ensure your continued agreement with its terms. If at
    any point you disagree with any of the terms of our Privacy Policy, you
    should request deletion of your Juju account by contacting us.</p>
    
    <h2>Conditions of Use</h2>
    
    <p>If you decide to use Juju’s website or services, your use and any
    possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our
    Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes,
    and application of Delaware law, without applying any conflict of laws
    principle that would result in the application of the law of any other
    state.</p>
    
    <h2>Effective Date</h2>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 3, 2006 and was last
    updated December 6, 2007.</p>
