														<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JobNavigator is an online service created for the 
																specific purpose of assisting job seekers in the development of their careers, 
																and in identifying potential employment or contracting positions. In addition, 
																Job Navigator assists employers or their representative agencies in identifying 
																individuals for potential employment or contract positions. In doing this, 
																JobNavigator handles a great deal of personal and confidential information. 
																Understanding this, and the importance of privacy and confidentiality to our 
																subscribers and Web site visitors, we have created these guidelines.</font></p>
														<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><a name="what"></a>What personal information does 
																	JobNavigator collect?<br>
																</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">JobNavigator gathers personal 
																information in two ways, and for two specific purposes. Firstly, as a service 
																designed to assist job seekers in identifying appropriate positions and in 
																developing careers, Job Navigator makes a request for you to complete your 
																curriculum vitae (CV). This CV information comprises personal details, contact 
																information, details of education and qualifications, salary information, and 
																skill profiles. The second type of personal information gathered by 
																JobNavigator is behavioral information in the use you make of JobNavigator or 
																explicit personal preference information requested by Job Navigator while you 
																make use of the service. People can visit JobNavigator web sites and access 
																information while remaining anonymous and not revealing any personal 
																information. However, in general the best use is made of JobNavigator when CV 
																information has been disclosed or when preference information is provided.</font></p>
														<p><font face="Arial" size="1"><a href="#top"><b>Top</b></a></font></p>
														<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><a name="usage"></a>How does JobNavigator make use of 
																	your personal information?</b><br>
																JobNavigator utilises the CV information you provide to identifying potential 
																positions or career development opportunities for you in its various databases. 
																In addition, JobNavigator provides your CV information to recruitment agencies 
																should they identify your CV in a database search as representing an 
																appropriate individual for a position they are attempting to fill. Finally, 
																JobNavigator provides access on your behalf to your CV in our database to 
																potential employers where you have specifically responded to a position 
																advertised by those employers through JobNavigator. JobNavigator endeavors to 
																qualify recruitment agencies making use of our databases as bona fida 
																recruitment agencies. JobNavigator maintains a strict policy of not allowing 
																employers to search our databases directly for the specific reason of concern 
																over job seekers' confidentiality. At any time you provide us with information, 
																you will be able to indicate whether you want to receive additional information 
																from JobNavigator. JobNavigator will not collect information from people who 
																identify themselves as being under 18 years of age in areas of the web site 
																which may be of interest to children. JobNavigator encourages parents to take 
																an active role in their children's use of the Internet. Several software 
																packages are available to help parents actively manage their family's use. 
																People under 18 years of age may request mailed or other information from Job 
																Navigator by having their parents submit the request.</font></p>

														<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><a name="protection"></a>How will JobNavigator protect 
																	your personal information?</b><br>
																JobNavigator will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share 
																with us. Whenever you give JobNavigator sensitive information (your CV or 
																credit card numbers, for instance), JobNavigator will take commercially 
																reasonable steps to establish a secure connection with your web browser. Credit 
																card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for 
																marketing purposes. JobNavigator endeavors to qualify recruitment agencies 
																making use of our databases as bona fida recruitment agencies. JobNavigator 
																maintains a strict policy of not allowing employers to search our databases 
																directly for the specific reason of concern over job seekers' confidentiality.</font></p>

														<p><b><a name="updating"></a><font face="Arial" size="2">How to update personal information</font></b><br>
															<font face="Arial" size="2">You can help JobNavigator to maintain the accuracy of 
																your information by notifying JobNavigator of any change to your address, 
																title, phone number, e-mail address or CV. If at any time you wish to stop 
																receiving communication from JobNavigator, you can contact us via our Web site
