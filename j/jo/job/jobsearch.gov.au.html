<h3>
 Cookies</h3>
<p>
 DEEWR uses cookies and other technologies to enhance job seekers’ online experience and collect data about the use of JobSearch in order to improve the quality of service.</p>
<p>
 A cookie is a small text file that a server places on your hard drive to identify that subsequent requests to a site have come from the same user. DEEWR uses cookies to ‘remember’ your browser between page visits. The cookie identifies your browser, not you personally. DEEWR uses cookies on JobSearch to develop patterns of site usage. No personal information is stored within JobSearch cookies. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature. For more information on cookies please refer to the help menu within your internet browser.</p>
<h3>
 Browsing activities</h3>
<p>
 DEEWR only identifies users by their browsing activities in cases where a law enforcement agency exercises a warrant to inspect DEEWR's logs, or for the purposes of market research conducted by DEEWR or its contractors.</p>
<h3>
 Personal and Protected Information</h3>

 The personal and protected information JobSearch collects includes your name, address, gender, Centrelink Reference Number and Job Seeker ID. This information is handled by DEEWR in accordance with privacy and social security law.</p>

 JobSearch, DEEWR and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held. However, DEEWR will not be responsible for events arising from unauthorised access of job seekers’ personal information.</p>
<p>
 You can also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure, by maintaining the confidentiality of any username and password. Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other internet user or any other breach of security.</p>
<p>
 JobSearch contains links to external sites. DEEWR is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. You should note there are inherent risks associated with transmission of information via the internet. Therefore you should make your own assessment of the potential risks to the security of information when making a decision as to whether or not to use external sites that are linked to or from JobSearch.</p>
<p>
 <strong>Please Note:</strong></p>
<p>
 Australian JobSearch advises job seekers to protect their privacy by ensuring they do not provide personal information, including bank account details to anyone they do not know.&nbsp; Job seekers are urged not to provide bank account details to any prospective employer until you have signed a contract of employment and/or you are satisfied with the bona fides of that employer.&nbsp;</p>
