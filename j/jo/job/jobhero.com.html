As an example, when you visit a webpage that supports the autofill function, we can record metadata generated by your web browser that identifies one or more autofill fields that you interact with.

<p> 	b) California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575 (b) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Provider responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings.

If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU Supervisory Authority.</p>
<p>Providing your information to us is optional, but it can impact our ability to offer the Service to you. For example, if you do not provide your complete Personal Information, we will not always be able to respond to your request in a timely manner.</p>
