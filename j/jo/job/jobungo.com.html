                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                
                    <h3>Updated 2014</h3>
<p>Jobungo.com (“Jobungo”) takes your privacy very seriously and has created this Privacy Policy in order to disclose its use of consumer data collected about you. You may contact Jobungo at 4533 MacArthur Blvd., Suite #254, Newport Beach, CA 92660 or via our <a href="/contact">contact form</a>.</p>
<p>By using the Jobungo website, or submitting information to us by other means, you are subjecting your information to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers Jobungo’s treatment of personal information that we collect when you are on Jobungo’s website and when you use Jobungo’s services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Jobungo does not own or control, including websites that we may link to, or to individuals that Jobungo does not employ or manage.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Updates</h3>
<p>Due to the Internet’s rapidly evolving nature, Jobungo may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Jobungo will post its updated Privacy Policy on our website located at www.jobungo.com. Jobungo encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this site and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to Jobungo will be subject to the then current Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Information Collection</h3>
<p>Jobungo may collect or receive information about you when you register or submit information, including, but not limited to, username, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, interests, resume and contents thereof, job search history, and any other data included in a submitted profile, resume, or search. Jobungo also collects information on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information, ratings, reviews, questions, and answers. Jobungo may also record actions taken on our site including, but not limited to, clicks, page views, IP address, and search queries. Jobungo may store this information in its equipment or the equipment of third party technology providers.</p>
<h3>Use of Information</h3>
<p>Jobungo, or companies we partner with, may contact you based on your interests such as job postings and career development opportunities. Jobungo’s site may require you to provide Jobungo with contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information. Jobungo may use your contact information to (a) send you job alerts; (b) create an account; or (c) send you information about Jobungo and promotional material from some of Jobungo’s partners. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. Jobungo may use demographic and/or profile data, including but not limited to search history, to tailor your experience on Jobungo’s site, show you content that Jobungo thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences.</p>
<p>To the extent you upload a resume, Jobungo may make the resume and other personal information contained therein available to third parties, including but not limited to employers and search engines. This means that the personal information contained in your resume can be viewed by third parties and you may receive unsolicited contact from third parties unaffiliated with Jobungo. Jobungo will make reasonable effort to safeguard the use of your personal information by third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Jobungo reserves the right to disclose any information as required by law.</p>
<p>We may use other companies as necessary to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Every effort will be made to safeguard your privacy when it may be accessed by other companies, including but not limited to technology providers; however, Jobungo will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies.</p>
<p>Jobungo may use your IP address to administer our site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you, your location, and to gather broad demographic information. Nothing shall restrict Jobungo from maintaining your data following your termination of your use of Jobungo’s site. Jobungo may delete your user data at Jobungo’s sole discretion.</p>
