            MSC adheres to The DMA Privacy Promise to the American Consumer.</p>
          <p><strong>Information Provided to MSC for MSC Use</strong></p>
          <p>We have constructed the MSC Web site so that you may visit the site

            It is not necessary to enter personal information or register to browse
            the MSC Web site. </p>
          <p>However, if you wish to view a demo, request a white paper or submit
            a question to MSC, you may be required to provide your name, business
            name and/or personal information for follow-up. MSC collects personal,
            visitor information from our Web site that is consistent with fulfilling
            the marketing information requested. If you provide MSC with personal
            information through this Web site, we may use the information to contact
            you regarding our products and services.</p>
          <p><strong>Information Provided to MSC for Client Use</strong></p>
          <p>From time to time, MSC clients or list comptrollers in cooperation
            with MSC clients, may provide MSC with copies of their data or their
            files for marketing purposes. Manipulation of the data provided to
            MSC shall not relieve our clients or list comptrollers, who partner
            with our clients, of their privacy responsibilities as data owners
            or list compilers. This responsibility is not transferred to MSC because
            MSC has prepared their data for marketing media.</p>
          <p>Personal information that is collected on behalf of our clients remains
            the property of our clients. Privacy information collected from client
            web sites or landing pages, which are maintained on MSC servers, remains
            the property of MSC clients. Privacy information collected as a result
            of re-directing promotion responses remains client property. </p>
          <p>Client data consigned to MSC for processing and response information,
            generated by client promotions and collected on MSC servers, remains
            the client property. MSC assumes no ownership, or ownership responsibilities,
            for data provided by or collected for its clients. Information will
            be returned to clients, erased or destroyed, at the completion of
            processing as directed by our clients.</p>
          <p><strong>How MSC and Client Information Is Used</strong></p>
          <p>Except as may be required by law, personal information given directly
            to MSC by an individual will only be used to fulfill the expressed
            objective of that individual. An individual may also be added to a
            list of other individuals targeted to receive correspondence pertaining
            to the same type of information. Personal information collected by
            MSC, for its own use, will not be sold, transferred or traded to any
            third party by MSC for unsolicited marketing purposes. </p>
          <p>Personal information, provided to MSC by its clients, or list comptrollers
            acting in partnership with our clients, or collected by MSC for our
            clients, will remain the property of the client or the list comptroller
            acting in cooperation with MSC clients. Personal information will
            only be disclosed, delivered to or destroyed as directed by our clients
            in accordance with their privacy policy or project instructions. Information
            provided by our clients or gathered for our clients will only be used
            as directed by our clients.</p>

            with MSC clients. MSC has security measures in place, in our facility,
            to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information
            that we have collected. Additionally, MSC has security measures in
