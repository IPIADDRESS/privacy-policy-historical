<br>
Joinred.com (“(PRODUCT) RED”) is owned by The Persuaders, LLC ("us" or "The Persuaders").

When we say personally identifiable information, we mean any data that identifies you as a particular individual, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Also, our privacy policy applies not only to information you personally provide to us, but also to information we collect through technology, such as your IP addresses, cookies, and stored passwords, if any. Once you click on an advertisement or an item offered by one of our partners, however, and you are no longer on our website, you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or the specific partner to see how your personal information will be handled on that site.<br>
<br>
Your data will be held on The Persuaders' data systems after you have registered on the (PRODUCT) RED website and will be removed in the event that the purpose for registration has been met or you inform us that you no longer wish to continue your registration as a recipient of<br>
(PRODUCT) RED related information. The Persuaders will ensure that all personal information supplied in the registration process is held securely and is accessible to you. The Persuaders will ensure you are only supplied with communications associated with (PRODUCT) RED and that your registration data is not passed to any associated third party (except as regards e-mail directed to an associated third party, as described below), unless you request otherwise.

Each commercial e-mail that we send to you, if any, will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of continuing to receive such messages. We may take up to ten (10) days to process your opt-out requests. In some instances, we may have already shared your information with one of our authorized third parties before you changed your e-mail and newsletter choices. In those cases, you may have to directly contact those third parties to opt-out of receiving their communications. We may send you transactional and relationship e-mail without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving those types of e-mail.<br>
