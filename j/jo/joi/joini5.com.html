    <h1>The Boloto Group Anti-Spam Policy</h1>
    
    <p>At Boloto Group, we  take permission seriously. By creating an account and agreeing to our <a href="/terms/" class="trm">Terms</a>, you are  also agreeing to this anti-spam policy.</p>
    
    <h3>The bottom line, it’s about permission</h3>
    
    <p>While the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/ecommerce/bus61.shtm">CAN-SPAM laws</a> are helpful reducing the spam problem, they are not  broad enough. Our definition of spam is more stringent than laws in most  countries and includes what we believe to be true permission. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Spam is any email you  send to someone who hasn’t given you their permission to contact them on the  topic of the email.</strong> <br>
      <br>
      Our definition of  permission is simple. Boloto Group has zero tolerance for spam. The following  are some specific examples for better understanding of Boloto Group’s Spam  Policy.</p>
    <p> To send email to  anyone representing Boloto Group opportunities, you must have clearly obtained  their permission. This could be done through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An email  newsletter <strong>subscription form</strong> on your web site. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>An opt-in  checkbox on a form. This checkbox must not be checked by default, the person  completing the form <strong>must willingly select</strong> the checkbox to indicate they want to hear from you. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>If someone <strong>completes an offline form</strong> like a survey or enters a competition, you can only contact  them if it was explained to them that they would be contacted by email AND they  checked a box indicating they would like to be contacted. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Customers  who have purchased from you <strong>within the last 2 years</strong>. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>If someone <strong>gives you their business card</strong> and you have explicitly asked for permission to add them  to your list, you can contact them. If they dropped their business card in a  fishbowl at a trade show, there must be a sign indicating they will be  contacted by email about that specific topic. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Basically, you can  only email someone who has clearly given you permission to email them  specifically about the subject you’re contacting them about.<br>
      <br>
    Methods not covered by  the examples above do not mean permission. Here are some examples to be  perfectly clear. By representing Boloto Group opportunities, you agree not to  import or send to any email address which:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You <strong>do not have provable permission</strong> to contact in relation to the topic of the email you’re  sending. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>You buy,  loan, rent or in any way acquire <strong>from a third  party</strong>, no matter what is claimed about &nbsp;the quality or permission basis. You need to  obtain permission yourself. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>You <strong>haven’t contacted via email in the last 2 years</strong>. Permission isn’t forever and these people change email  addresses or may not remember giving you their prior permission. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>You <strong>scraped or copy and pasted</strong> from the web. A published email address doesn’t mean they want to hear from  you. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some people might have  given you their email address, but if you don’t have permission to email them a  message then you are not permissioned. Sending invitational or promotional  emails to these type of relations won’t be effective and will most likely be  marked as spam and reported to Boloto Group.</p>
    <h3>We’ll hear about it if you spam</h3>
    <p>Boloto Group has  numerous reporting and monitoring services to ensure you comply with our  anti-spam policy. These monitor blacklists and abuse reporting across the board  from ISPs to Spam Cop.&nbsp; We are notified  of any spam complaints directly.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      If we receive spam  complaints we will terminate your account with Boloto Group immediately. These  include, but not limited to, accounts at Invite 5, Get The Bar, Join i5, 10  Cent Ads, Just Be Right and The Tuesday Review.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      It’s common sense. If  the recipient of your email doesn’t recognize who you are or isn’t interested  in what you’re communicating, they’ll think you’re a spammer. It’s that simple.<br>
      <br>
      If you want to report  spamming activity by one of our users, contact our abuse department at:&nbsp; abuse at boloto group dot com<br>
