      Last updated and effective as of: January 1, 2015

    <p>
      Welcome to the website located at www.joinhandshake.com and related subdomains
      (the “Site”) and/or the Handshake Software-as-a-Service product and related
      services (the “Service”), each owned and operated by Stryder Corp.
      (“Stryder,”  “we,” “us,” or “our,” as used in this Policy).  This Privacy
      Policy explains how we collect, use and share information gathered from
      visitors to our Site and end-users of our Services (“you,” “your, or “users”
      as used in this Policy).  If you engage us to provide services directly to
      your organization or university, our data handling promises are set forth in
      our contract with you.
    </p>
    <h4>
      We want to be clear up front, though the following policy explains in detail:
    </h4>
    <p>
      Students who use our Services may upload or direct us to collect personal
      information about them and information about their education history.  In this
      case, we will share part of all of the information we gather with potential
      employers and/or third parties that can help such students get jobs. We may
      generate reports from our collective data holding that describe some or all of
      our users on an anonymous basis, and in some cases we may sell such reports.
      Once you have used the Services, certain results of the processing of your
      data will be stored on our servers indefinitely, though we remove personal
      information after you delete your account. What We Collect
    </p>
    <p>
      When you visit the Site, we log and store your IP Address and technical
      information about your visit like your browser type and how you progressed
      through the Site, where you abandoned it, etc. (“Usage Data”).  We may also
      connect Usage Data in connection with your use of the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Site visitor, we place a small piece of software referred to as a “cookie ”
      on your computer to help us collect this Usage Data.  If you use the Services
      and create an account, we also use this cookie to recognize you on return
      visits and expedite the login process. You can remove this and other cookies
      through your browser preferences menu, though the exact method varies
      depending on the type of browser you use – but note that you won’t be able to
      log into our service if your cookies are disabled.  If you visit from a mobile
      device, we may reference your device identifier or other information about
      where your visit originated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies used by our Services are “session” cookies that last between 2 and 3
      hours by default, which expire after you log out.  If you select “Remember me”
      when you login, this cookie is stored for a longer period of up to 20 years in
      order to expedite future logins and avoid your having to re-enter passwords
      frequently.  We encrypt our cookies and do not store personal information in
      these cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you register, we collect and store your name, email, school, GPA,
      [address, phone] and other contact information, and you may choose to enter
      other information about yourself, your major, or your job history, for
      example.  We refer to all of this information in this Policy as “Registration
      Information.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When we send an email from the Service, it contains embedded software code
      that tracks when the email has been opened or clicked upon.  This functionality
      sends the resulting records back to our Service, which may be associated with
      other information you have provided us.
    </p>
    <p>
      To stop receiving notifications and/or promotions, please click the link
      found at the bottom of each email or update your account preferences.
    </p>
    <h4>
      How We Use It
    </h4>
    <p>
      Usage Data helps us monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of
      visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our Site, diagnose or
      fix technology problems, and otherwise plan for, improve and enhance our Site
      or our business operations. We may associate Usage Data we automatically
      collect with your other information if you become a user of the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use Registration Information to help connect you with potential employers
      and to help employers better understand their applicant pools, including by
      searching all candidates using our Services through a filtered search or
      query.  This may result in display of your name, GPA, and major (for example)
      to an employer, in those employers/entities making direct contact with you,
      and/or the display of advertising those entities think might be relevant to
      you.  Your identity and application information may be displayed to employers
      according to your expressed preferences when using the Services. Information
      about an employer’s organization may also be displayed to other users.  For
      example, to allow you to apply for a particular position, we may forward your
      resume to the applicable employer.   We don’t collect or use information about
      you that you don’t input into the Services unless you choose to integrate a
      third party account you control with Handshake, in which case we may use data
      collected through that application in other ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Registration Information and Usage Data may be de-identified (according
      to our best efforts) and used to create reports about our user behavior, to
      run analytics, to generate advertising criteria that we allow third parties to
      use to target ads to our users, to make suggestions in our applications and
      Services for matching criteria, and other similar reporting and analytics
      functions (including selling anonymized reports to third parties).   These
      external reports would not include personally-identifiable information about
      users of our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data regarding employers and their behavior on the Services and in related
      transactions may also be collected and used in reporting and analytics.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Sharing
    </h4>
    <p>
      We may share Usage Data with our third party service providers in the course
      of our operations, with affiliates of our business, or in connection with the
      display of first or third party advertising specific to your geographic
      location.  We may also engage third parties to help us improve our business,
      such as analytics providers, and such parties may have access to aggregate or
      individual Usage Data.
    </p>
    <h4>
      We may also share users’ personal information with:
    </h4>
    <p>
      Other companies owned by or under common ownership with us (i.e., any
      organization we own or control) or our ultimate holding companies (i.e., any
      organization that owns or controls us) and any subsidiaries it owns. These
      companies will use your personal information in the same way as we can under
      this Policy; Third party vendors, consultants and other service providers that
      perform services on our behalf, in order to carry out their work for us, which
      may include providing cloud storage or hosting services, marketing assistance,
      email delivery, content or service fulfillment, or providing analytics
      services. We share personal information with these third parties as needed to
      perform services for us and under reasonable confidentiality terms; Our
      business partners who offer a service to you jointly with us, for example,
      when running a co-sponsored contest or promotion or offering employment
      opportunities to our users; Third parties upon your request. For example, you
      may have the option to share your activities on our Services with your friends
      through social media or with employers you want to contact; Other parties in
      connection with any company transaction, such as a merger, sale of company
      assets or shares, reorganization, financing, change of control or acquisition
      of all or a portion of our business by another company or third party or in
      the event of bankruptcy or related or similar proceedings; and Third parties
      as required to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena/court
      order, legal process or other government request, (ii) enforce our Terms of
      Service, including the investigation of potential violations thereof, (iii)
      investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or
      allegations, (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of
      Stryder, Handshake, its users or the public as required or permitted by law
      and (v) detect, prevent or otherwise address criminal (including fraud or
      stalking), security or technical issues. We may also share information with
      others in an aggregated and anonymous form that does not reasonably identify
      you directly as an individual. Storage, Security and How to Remove Your
      Information
    </p>
    <p>
      We store user Personal Information on servers in the United States under the
      control of our third party service provider in a single database.  While we
      reserve the right to change service providers, the current provider maintains
      security features in compliance with ISO 27001, SOC1 and SOC 2/SSAE 16/ISAE
      3402 (formerly known as SAS 70 Type II, PCI level 1, FISMA Moderate, and
      requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our servers’ data is backed up by our service providers daily.  We perform
      monthly penetration testing on our own application to consistently improve our
      internal, custom security features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transmissions to and from (and between) our Services’ user interface(s) are
      encrypted with Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology. We use 128-bit SSL as
      of the date of this policy to secure transmissions within, to, and from our
      Services (including data incoming from third party sources).
    </p>
    <p>
      As of the date of this policy, we are in the process of encrypting our
      databases while “at rest” – that is, during storage while the data is not
      being used or called by our servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use access restrictions to limit third party access to our admin functions.
      Except in cases of emergency, Administrators with access to user personal
      information only access the information necessary to perform their specific
      functions. Such Administrators must have be employed by us under standard
      employee confidentiality restrictions or must have passed  our internal review
      process, each of which include spending time being trained on ethical handling
      of data and proper data access policies.  Such access is carefully logged and
      monitored, and the need for continued access is periodically re-reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We care about the security of your information and use commercially reasonable
      physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the
      integrity and security of all information we collect and, in some cases, share
      with our service providers – as described above.   Information at rest, stored
      on our servers, is only encrypted where a partner university so requests.   IF
      YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE UNENCRYPTED STORAGE OF THE INFORMATION
      DESCRIBED HEREIN, PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT INFORMATION TO US THROUGH THE SERVICES.
      While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches, no
      website or internet transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee
      that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or other breach will never occur.
      In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result
      of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the
      situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information
      may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any
      applicable laws and regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your activity on the Site does not allow us to recognize or acknowledge Do Not
      Track signals, though our registration process and services are secured
      according to specific contractual promises.  Do not transmit any sensitive or
      personal information using the Site other than as directed to enter into a
      subscription or trial with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deleting Your Account. Personal Information is sent to archive if a user
      deletes or abandons their account.  Users can do so by sending a message to
      “support@joinhandshake.com” requesting such deletion.  You can also archive
      your account within the Service.  If deletion is requested, accounts are
      archived for sixty days in case the user changes his or her mind, or a career
      services agent makes a mistake and didn’t mean to delete the account.
      Archiving the student will not remove their Personal Information entirely from
      our systems. After the 60 day retention period, we will remove and/or
      disassociate your name, email address, and/or personal contact information
      from our records in any way practicable, though we retain certain usage
      information about your behavior and interactions while using our service,
      backup copies of certain of our data, and other de-identified information
      about your account activity notwithstanding any such deletion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third Party Links
    </p>
    <p>
      The Site may, from time to time, contain links to and from third party
      websites of our partner networks, advertisers, partner merchants, retailers
      and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note
      that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept
      any responsibility or liability for their policies. Please check the
      individual policies before you submit any information to those websites.
    </p>

    </h4>
    <p>
      Minors under 18 are not permitted to use our Site without express parental
      consent to both use the Services and be bound by our Terms of Service and this
      Policy.  We do not intentionally collect information from minors under 13.  If
      you believe we have collected any personal information from a child younger
      than 13 years of age, please notify us immediately at
      support@joinhandshake.com and we will do anything reasonably possible to
      remove that information from our systems.
    </p>
