      Welcome to Handshake!
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are a career services platform that connects students, schools and
      employers to democratize the job finding experience in college and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Privacy Policy applies to your use of the joinhandshake.com website and
      the Handshake Service (collectively “the Handshake Service” or “the
      Service”), as well as your relationship with Stryder Corp. (“Handshake”,
      “Handshake”).This policy is part of Handshake’s
      <a href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a>. By using our Service, you
      agree to both our
      <a href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a> and this Privacy Policy;
      if you do not agree, please do not use the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may change over time. If we make minor changes to it
      without materially changing your rights, we will post the modified Policy
      on our website. We will notify you by email, through the Handshake
      Service, or by presenting you with a new Privacy Policy to accept if we
      make a modification that materially changes your rights. When you use the
      Handshake Service after a modification is posted, you are telling us that
      you accept the modified terms.
    </p>

    <h2 class="header header__lg header--bold header--top-spacing">
      What Information We Collect
    </h2>
    <p>
      We collect personal and non-personal data from you when you use our
      Services.  Personal Data is data that includes a personal identifier like
      your name, email or address, phone number, or is data that could
      reasonably be linked back to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need to have an account to use Handshake. You can create an account on
      Handshake as a student seeking a job or career advice or as an employer
      looking for exciting new talent.  You may also create an account as a
      career center or school employee or volunteer or as an invited mentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Student or Alumni Data:</b> We receive personal data about you when you
      create a Student or Alumni Account, update your profile, respond to
      questions or surveys on our website or otherwise use our Site, from our
      Partner Universities, and from other third party data sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>From University Partners:</b>  Our University Partners share
      information about their students with us so we can provide them with
      services that they use to manage their career centers.  Each University
      Partner chooses what it shares, which may include your name, mailing and
      email address, major, or GPA.  Where FERPA applies to data shared by
      university partners, it is stored, used and shared in compliance with the
      statute.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>From You, Your Account and Your Profile:</b> You can choose to share
      additional information with us, such as an updated email address, phone
      number, work experience, resume and transcript, and answers to questions
      about your interests and activities that will be covered by this Privacy
      Policy and our <a href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a>.  You can
      also share this information by updating your profile, uploading documents
      that include personal information, or answering questions or surveys (such
      as the First Destination Survey) we email you or present to you on the
      Services. We will not use your phone number to send any commercial or
      marketing messages to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>From Third Parties:</b> We may receive additional information about you
      from other schools, alumni or career counseling organizations, or from
      other sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Usage and Log Data:</b> When you visit the Site, we log and store your
      IP Address and technical information about your visit like your browser
      type and how you progressed through the Site, where you abandoned it, etc.
      (“Usage Data”).  We can use your IP address to determine your general
      location.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Employer Data:</b> When Employers create a Handshake Employer Account,
      we request contact information, including email address and telephone
      number, to provide a point of contact for Universities and administrative
      staff and which is made available on your public profile.  We will not use
      your phone number to send any commercial or marketing messages not related
      to your use of Handshake Services to you without your express consent.
    </p>

    <h2 class="header header__lg header--bold header--top-spacing">
      How We Use Your Personal Data
    </h2>
    <p>
      We use your Personal Data to provide the Handshake Service and to maximize
      opportunities to connect you with potential employers. This includes:
      </p><ul>
        <li>
          Providing services such as allowing you to make appointments with
          career center professionals or sign up for career fairs and other
          events.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allowing you to opt-in to make your profile public so potential
          employers, or others can find you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allowing you to contact employers and employers to contact you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personalizing the Service. For example, we may suggest employers to
          you based on the information in your resume or the demographic
          information you provide or suggest students with public profiles to
          employers based on employers search criteria.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contacting you about additional Handshake or Partner services you
          might be interested in, unless you opt-out (see “Opting out of
          Marketing messages”).
        </li>
        <li>
          Researching new ways to improve the Handshake Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using FERPA protected data only in compliance with the requirements of
          the statute.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h2 class="header header__lg header--bold header--top-spacing">
      When We May Share Your Personal Data
    </h2>
    <p>
      We will only share your personal data with third parties under the
      following circumstances:
      </p><ul>
        <li>
          With your consent. For example, you may consent to make your profile
          public so that we can share it with employers through the Services or
          choose to apply to a job and we will share your profile information,
          resume and transcript with the employers you choose.
        </li>
        <li>
          With companies that are contractually engaged in providing us with
          services, such as order fulfillment, email management and credit card
          processing. These companies are obligated by contract to safeguard any
          personal data they receive from us.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a
          law, regulation, valid legal process (e.g., subpoenas or warrants
          served on us), or governmental or regulatory request, to enforce or
          apply the <a href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a>, to protect
          the security or integrity of the Handshake Service, and/or to protect
          the rights, property, or safety of Handshake, its employees, users, or
          others. If we are going to release your data, we will do our best to
          provide you with notice in advance by email, unless we are prohibited
          by law from doing so.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may disclose or transfer your personal data in connection with the
          sale, merger, bankruptcy, sale of assets or reorganization of our
          company. We will notify you if a different company will receive your
          personal data and the promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to
          your data as transferred to the new entity.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h2 class="header header__lg header--bold header--top-spacing">
      When We Use and Share Non-Personal Data
    </h2>
    <p>
      Non personal data is data that itself cannot reasonably be linked back to
      you or data that is combined with other data in a way that cannot
      reasonably be linked back to you.  We use and share your non personal,
      de-identified or aggregated data in a variety of ways to help our Partners
      and the public understand trends in the job seeking market through
      analytics reports, statistics and other metrics and guides. For example,
      to understand:
      </p><ul>
        <li>
          What percentages of students from certain colleges work in a specific
          geographic area.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whether a certain major or extra-curricular activity fits well with a
          particular employer’s hiring patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          How employers compare to each other in the number of applicants they
          receive from different colleges.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h2 class="header header__lg header--bold header--top-spacing">
      Cookies
    </h2>
    <p>
      As a Site visitor, we place a small piece of software referred to as a
      “session cookie” on your computer. If you use the Services and create an
      account, we also use this cookie to recognize you on return visits and
      expedite the login process. You can remove this and other cookies through
      your browser preferences menu, though the exact method varies depending on
      the type of browser you use – but note that you won’t be able to log into
      our service if your cookies are disabled. If you visit from a mobile
      device, we may reference your device identifier or other information about
      where your visit originated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our email communications contain web beacons or similar technology which
      track when the email has been opened or read. This functionality sends the
      resulting records back to our Service, which may be associated with other
      information you have provided us.
    </p>

      unsubscribe link found at the bottom of each email or update your account
      preferences.
    </p>

    <h2 class="header header__lg header--bold header--top-spacing">
      Storage, Security and How to Remove Your Information
    </h2>
    <p>
      We use industry standard technical, administrative and physical controls
      to protect your data including encrypting it at rest and as it is
      transferred from you to Handshake.  While we take reasonable precautions
      against possible security breaches, no website or internet transmission is
      completely secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access,
      hacking, data loss or other breach will never occur. In the event of a
      breach, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and,
      where appropriate, notify affected individuals in accordance with any
      applicable laws and regulations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="header header__lg header--bold header--top-spacing">
      Do Not Track Signals
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are currently unable to respond to Do Not Track signals that may be
      sent by some browsers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="header header__lg header--bold header--top-spacing">
      De-activating Your Account or Deleting Your Personal Data
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can choose to deactivate your account so that you are no longer
      viewable on the Service or you can make your account private.   You may
      also request Handshake delete information about you, however we may be
      obligated as a service provider to your college or university to retain
      certain data about you. You can do this by sending a message to
      “support@joinhandshake.com” requesting such deactivation or deletion.
    </p>

    <h2 class="header header__lg header--bold header--top-spacing">
      Third Party Links
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Services may contain links to and from third party websites of our
      Employer and University Partners or other Handshake Partners.  If you
      follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites
      have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any
      responsibility or liability for their policies. We also cannot be
      responsible for your personal data that you submit to employers using the
      Services.  Please check their individual policies before you submit any
      information to those websites.
    </p>

    <h2 class="header header__lg header--bold header--top-spacing">
      Children
    </h2>
    <p>
      Minors under 18 are not permitted to use our Site without express parental
      consent to both use the Services and be bound by our <a href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a> and this Policy. We do not
      intentionally collect information from minors under 13. If you believe we
      have collected any personal information from a child younger than 13 years
      of age, please notify us immediately at support@joinhandshake.com and we
      will take reasonable measures to remove that information from our systems.
    </p>

    <h2 class="header header__lg header--bold header--top-spacing">
      Payments
    </h2>
    <p>
      Handshake provides the ability for employers to pay schools for collateral
      expenses, such as hosting a booth at a career fair, through the use of a
      third party payment processor. Handshake does not collect or use any of
      that payment information. If an employer has any conflicts regarding the
      method of payment acceptance, they should contact the school. Handshake
      claims no responsibility or liability for payment transactions.
