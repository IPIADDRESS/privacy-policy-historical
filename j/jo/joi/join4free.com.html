The following is our privacy statement regarding our gathering and
dissemination of information practices for this website.
</p>
<p>
We use your IP address to administer our website and to help diagnose problems with our
server. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic
information.
</p>
<p>
In our site's subscription you are required to give us contact information (to include
names and E-mail addresses), and in some cases, financial information (to include account
or credit card numbers).
</p>
<p>
We use customer contact information from the subscription form to send the user information
about our company, a free E-mail newsletter and promotional material from some of our
partners and affiliates. Occasionally contact information is used to contact you when
necessary. Before you actually receive any promotional materials or other communications
from us, you will be sent a confirmation email requiring you to reply and confirm that you
wish to be added to the mailing list. If you do not respond, you will not be added to the
subscriber list.
</p>
<p>
You may always opt-out of receiving future e-mailings. All of our communications contain
'opt-out' sections. Although we have not done so in the past, we reserve the right to sell
your email address and/or demographic data to third parties with the proviso that any
solicitations or communications from such third parties to your email address always
contain 'opt-out' sections  which 'opt-out' sections would, if you elect to 'opt-out', stop
all future emails from us and from any third parties who we may have received your email
address from us.
</p>
<p>
Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and
demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use data from our
surveys to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some
of our partners and affiliates. Demographic and profile data are also collected at our
site. We may use this data to tailor our visitors' experience at our site showing them
content according to their preferences. Anonymous demographic information is shared with
advertisers and market researchers on an aggregate basis. As indicate above, any e-mail
from us will always include specific instructions on how to unsubscribe.
</p>
<p>
We may in our sole discretion, develop and use consumer research based on Users' use of
the service. All marketing information shall be subject, in all cases, to compliance with
the applicable rules and regulations of the Communication Commission, and other relevant
laws and regulations; as the same may be amended from time to time.
