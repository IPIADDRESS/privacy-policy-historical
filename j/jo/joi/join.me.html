<p><strong>Service Data (including Session and Usage data):</strong></p>
<p>When you use our Services, we receive information generated through the use of the Service, either entered by you or others who use the Services with you (for example, schedules, attendee info, etc.), or from the Service infrastructure itself, (for example, duration of session, use of webcams, connection information, etc.)&nbsp; We may also collect usage and log data about how the services are accessed and used, including information about the device you are using the Services on, IP addresses, location information, language settings, what operating system you are using, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data to help us support the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Data:</strong> We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about you. We may also receive information from other affiliated companies that are a part of our corporate group. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new prospects for marketing, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Location Information: </strong>We collect your location-based information for the purpose of providing and supporting the service and for fraud prevention and security monitoring.

<p>If you wish to cancel your account or for us to stop providing you services, or if we hold personal information about you and you want it to be removed from our database or inactivated, please <u>contact us</u> here.</p>
<strong>3. Analytics, Cookies and Other Web Site Technologies</strong>
<p>LogMeIn is continuously improving our websites and products through the use of various third party web analytics tools, which help us understand how visitors use our websites, desktop tools, and mobile applications, what they like and dislike, and where they may have problems. While we maintain ownership of this data, we do not share this type of data about individual users with third parties.</p>
<p>Geolocation and Other Data:</p>
<p>We may utilize precise Geolocation data but only if you specifically opt-in to collection of that data in connection with a particular service. We also use information such as IP addresses to determine the general geographic locations areas of our visitors. The web beacons used in conjunction with these web analytics tools may gather data such as what browser or operating system a person uses, as well as, domain names, MIME types, and what content, products and services are reviewed or downloaded when visiting or registering for services at one of our websites or using one of our mobile applications.</p>
<p>Google Analytics and Adobe Marketing Cloud:</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics as described in <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">“How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.”</a> You can prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics on websites by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.&nbsp; We also employ IP address masking, a technique used to truncate IP addresses collected by <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">Google Analytics</a> and store them in an abbreviated form to prevent them from being traced back to individual users. Portions of our website may also use Google Analytics for Display Advertisers including DoubleClick or Dynamic Remarketing which provide interest-based ads based on your visit to this or other websites.&nbsp; You can use <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated">Ads Settings</a> to manage the Google ads you see and opt-out of interest-based ads.&nbsp; We also use Adobe Marketing Cloud as described <a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html#use">here</a>.&nbsp; You can opt-out of use of this information as described below.</p>
<p>Tracking Technologies:</p>
<p>LogMeIn and our partners use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track user traffic patterns and hold certain registration information. Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our service. If you wish to not have the information these technologies collect used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">opt-out here</a>, or if located in the European Union, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">click here</a>. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can still review the website if you choose to set your browser to refuse all cookies; however, you must enable cookies in order to establish an account and to install the Services.

<li>As required by law, for example, to comply with a valid subpoena or other legal process; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, or to protect your safety (or the safety of others); to investigate fraud; or to respond to a government request.</li>
</ul>

These emails and messages are considered a necessary part of the Services and you may not opt-out of them.</li>
<li>Sending emails about new products or other news about LogMeIn that we think you’d like to hear about either from us or from our business partners. You can always opt out of these types of messages at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each communication.</li>

<strong>6. Accessing Your Data</strong>
<p>Our customers can always review, update or change personal information from within their account. LogMeIn will also, when you request, provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information.&nbsp; Please <a href="http://support.citrixonline.com/">contact us here</a> if you need assistance in reviewing your information. LogMeIn will respond to your access request to review the information we have on file for you within a reasonable time.</p>

<p>We may also collect information on behalf of our customers, in order to provide the services, and we may not have a direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data is processed. If you are a customer or end-user of one of our customers, please contact them (as the data controller) directly if: (i) you would no longer like to be contacted by them; or (ii) to access, correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data. &nbsp;If requested to remove data by our customer, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

<p>We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service, and when we do, these transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by appropriate transfer agreements. We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customer for as long as needed to provide services to our customer. Also, we will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<p>LogMeIn is headquartered in the United States of America and maintains a global infrastructure.&nbsp; Information that we collect and maintain may be transferred to, or controlled and processed in, the United States and/or other countries around the world. When you provide us with information, or use our website(s) and services, you consent to this transfer.&nbsp; We will protect the privacy and security of personal information we collect in accordance with this privacy policy, regardless of where it is processed or stored.</p>

<strong>7. Security</strong>
<p>LogMeIn follows generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received, however, no security measure is perfect. We recommend safeguarding your password, as it is one of the easiest ways you can manage the security of your own account – remember that if you lose control over your password, you may lose control over your personal information.</p>
