You may also be required to provide proof of eligibility for academic pricing which may include but is not limited to a birth certificate, social security number, school identification, or a valid driver's license.  If you call our customer service, we may collect personal information you knowingly and voluntarily provide through your contact with our customer service representatives.<br>
<br>
We furthermore collect information that is sent to us by your web browser, which may include without limitation information that does not identify you personally (such as the date and time of your visit, information about your web browser, etc.). The information we receive in such manner depends on the settings on your web browser. If you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this website, we may link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you personally and use it for the purposes described below. Please review the settings of your web browser if you want to learn what information your browser can send or how to change your browser settings.<br>
<br>
We may also receive certain personal information about you from third parties where you have agreed to share such information with us, such as through your use of a social network authentication to sign in to this website.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Cookies and Web Beacons, JavaScript tags, and Other Web Technologies</b><br>
<br>
We collect information that is typically not personally identifiable through the use of web technologies, including without limitation "session cookies," "persistent cookies," "web beacons" (also referred to as "tracking pixels,"), "pixel tags," or "action tags"), and "Javascript tags." As the Internet evolved, we may implement and use different types of technologies for this purpose.<br>
<br>
We may place web technologies on this site directly, and may place web technologies on behalf of the partner whose branding appears on this website or its service providers and allow that partner to utilize the data collected.  They also help us identify your IP address.  The information collected by web technologies does not identify you personally. However, if you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this website, for example, by making a purchase, we may link the information we collect using web technologies to the information that identifies you personally.<br>
<br>
<i>Cookies.</i>  When you visit this website, your computer may receive one or more "cookies" in order to help personalize and support your use of this website, our services, and/or the services of our partners. A "cookie" is a small text file that is transferred to your computer's web browser by a web server, and can be read by a web server in the same domain at a later time.  If you do not wish to receive cookies or wish to manage when you accept cookies in general, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. We provide more information on this in the "Your Choices" section, below. Although you are not required to accept our cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this website. Cookies allow a website to customize information that is presented to you through your use of this website (such as to display personalized content and targeted advertising to you on your future visits to this website), and to save time by storing information so you do not need to re-enter it during a later use of our website. In general, cookies do not identify you personally. We may use a combination of "session cookies" and "persistent cookies" on this website, further described below.<br>
<br>
<i>Session Cookies. </i>A "session cookie" is a temporary cookie that expires when you close your browser. A session cookie assigns a randomly-generated, unique identification number to your computer when you access this website. Assigning your computer a number facilitates the proper functioning of the features of our websites by permitting us to maintain a  for your session, such as maintaining the contents of your shopping cart during checkout. We also use session cookies to collect anonymous information (i.e., information that does not identify you personally) about the ways visitors use this website - which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. We analyze this information (known as "click-stream information") to better understand our visitors' interests and needs and to improve the content and functionality of this website.<br>
<br>
<i>Persistent Cookies.</i> Unlike a session cookie, a "persistent cookie" does not expire when you close your browser. It stays on your computer until the expiration date set in the cookie (for example, at the end of a calendar month) or until you delete it.  Persistent cookies can be used to "tag" your computer so that the next time you visit (or someone using your computer visits), our server will recognize you, not by name, but by the "tag" on your computer. This will enable us to provide you with a personalized experience even if we do not know who you are. It will also allow us to collect more accurate information about the ways people use this website, for example, how people use this website on their first visit and how often they return.  Using persistent cookies permits us to provide you with a more personalized shopping experience and, in some cases, may save you the trouble of re-entering information already in our database.<br>
<br>
<i>Web Beacons. </i> When you visit this website, your computer may receive one or more "web beacons" in order to assist us with delivering cookies on this website, to collect anonymous information about the use of this website by our visitors, and to deliver customized or targeted content to you on this website and through our partners.  Web beacons (also referred to as "tracking pixels," "1x1 gifs," "single-pixel gifs," "pixel tags," or "action tags") are graphic images, usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel, placed at various locations on this website. They also help us identify browser types, search terms that bring visitors to our website, and the domain names of websites that refer traffic to us. We also utilize web beacons to provide us with more information on any emails we send out.  In particular, a web beacon in an email communication will send us information to let us know that you have received, opened, or acted upon an e-mail you have chosen to receive from us.<br>
<br>
<i>JavaScript Tags.</i>  This website may include one or more JavaScript tags which are used by us to collect anonymous information about the use of this website by our visitors, and to deliver customized or targeted content to you on this website and through our partners.  We may use JavaScript tags to anonymously track how visitors interact with our websites, including where they came from and the manner in which they use our websites.<br>
<br>

In addition, we may "de-identify" personal information by removing any information that identifies you specifically, and use the rest for the purposes set forth above.<br>
<br>
<i>Our Partners.</i> When we make a vendor's products available for sale through a website we operate, we are doing so as an independent e-commerce reseller of, or service provider for, that vendor, and if the website is co-branded, the partner whose name and/or logo appears on the particular website. In connection with your purchase of a product or service through an online store we operate, we will provide certain of the personal information and/or anonymous information you provide to our partner whose branding appears on the particular website in connection with your purchase to that partner for reporting purposes, to allow our partner or its service provider to register your purchase, to enable your access to products or services provided by our partner or its suppliers, to facilitate warranty, technical support or after-sales service, to allow our partner or its subcontractor to send communications to you if you have consented to receive them, to allow our partner or its service provider to provide services in connection with this website such as customer support or single sign-on functionality on this website and our s website, or for similar purposes in order to fulfill obligations to you. We may also include your name, educational institution, list of purchased products, and manner of verification of educational eligibility to certain product manufacturers if required by them to verify educational eligibility for certain promotions. We may also make your eligibility verification information available for review by such product manufacturers at our facilities in connection with an audit by that product manufacturer, provided the product manufacturer is under contractual obligation to us to keep all such reviewed information confidential.  We may also provide certain of the personal information you provide in connection with your purchase to the publisher or manufacturer of a product you purchase, or operator of a service for which you purchase a service use right from us, if different than the partner whose name and/or logo appears on this website.  The privacy policy of our partner, and of the publisher, manufacturer or operator of the product or service you provide, will govern how that party uses and protects any of your personal information that we provide to them.<br>
<br>
<i>Our Service Providers.</i> We utilize other companies, including but not limited to our corporate affiliates, to provide joint services or certain services to us or on our behalf and help us to operate our business.

We will not share your personal information with our affiliates or unrelated third parties to use for their own marketing purposes without your consent.<br>
<br>
<i>To Comply With Legal Requirements, Cooperate With Law Enforcement, Prevent Fraud and Other Crimes, and Protect Legal Rights, Property, You and Others.</i> To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may disclose the personal information we collect on this website without notifying you when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a regulatory requirement; to comply with governmental, administrative or judicial process, requirement or order, such as a subpoena or court order; to cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental investigations (without necessarily requiring the law enforcement or government agency requesting the information to formally serve us with a subpoena); to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce a contract; to protect the legal rights, property or safety of JourneyEd, its corporate affiliates, and their respective employees, clients and partners and agents, other users or the public in general; or to protect your vital interests if determined necessary by us.

<br>
<i>In Connection With Corporate Events.</i> If one of our corporate affiliates or a third party has acquired our business, specific assets or the business of one of our operating divisions through which you have provided information to us, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation, your personal information will become owned by that company.
