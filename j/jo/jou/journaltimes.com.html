<span style="color:#003399;">PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT FOR <span style="font-weight:700;">The Journal Times On-line</span></span>
<br><br>
Welcome to the Web sites of The Journal Times, a media company located in Racine, Wisconsin. We believe in your right to know what information is collected during your visit to our Web sites and how the information is used and safeguarded. 
<br><br>
The information gathered by the JournalTimes.com Web site falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our Web sites through optional registration and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our sites. 
<br><br>
<font color="#003399">INFORMATION GATHERED BY VOLUNTARY SUBMISSION</font><br>
To make use of certain features on our Web sites (such as free email, personal Web pages, chatrooms and other interactive forums) visitors need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration or participation process. (We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, sex, age, and zip code, and we might request information on your interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like.)  
<br><br>
The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our sites to your interests and make them more useful to you.  The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we need, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to our sites. Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our sites without registration.
<br><br>
<font color="#003399">INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY GATHERED ABOUT ALL VISITORS</font><br>
We collect aggregate and user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit. This information is used to generate reports that help JournalTimes.com assess the value of and interest in the various Web sites. The information we collect is used by us to improve the content of our Web page. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. 
<br><br>
Our Web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address but not the e-mail address, when you visit our sites.  Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our Web pages to you upon request, to tailor our sites to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our sites. 
<br><br>
To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we may utilize a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie".  The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. A cookie can't read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers or content partners may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we cannot control.  We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. It is a cookie, for example, that allows us to deliver your personalized stock quotes each time you visit a site. 
<br><br>
<font color="#003399">INFORMATION SHARED WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS</font><br>
When we present information to our advertisers -- to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our Web sites -- it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our sites.  From time to time, we may share information on visitors to our sites with those marketing products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. This list can include your e-mail address and, other specific information (such as your phone number or street address) you may have provided us while online.
<br><br>
<font color="#003399">SPECIAL ATTENTION TO CHILDREN</font><br>
Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We do not specifically collect information about children.  We encourage parents to review and share safety tips with their children participating in the online experience.
<br><br>
A final note: JournalTimes.com is affiliated with other online companies, some of which feature our branding. This policy statement does not apply to those companies' Web sites; please refer to these affiliated sites to obtain information on their privacy policies. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information. 
<br><br>
The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes before they take effect.  Of course, our use of information gathered while the current policy is in effect will always be consistent with the current policy, even if we change that policy later.
