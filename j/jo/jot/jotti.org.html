<html><head></head><body><pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">The following discloses our privacy policy for Jotti's malware scan. We recognise that privacy is important and we want you to completely understand what happens with the
information you send to us.

Our service is designed to be used anonymously. We are not interested in names, addresses, or other information providing insight into the identities of our visitors.

We log information you voluntarily provide us with. As you may or may not be aware, web browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer) provide certain information to every website you
visit, such as your current IP address, operating system (e.g. Windows), as well as the URL of the website you came from. As far as we use this information, it is handled
anonymously. For example, we do not track which browser anyone uses, but we may index how many of our visitors use Internet Explorer or chart how many of our visitors
visit our service from France. We also use IP addresses to prevent and respond to abuse of our service; we may, for example, use someone's IP address to deny that computer or
network access to our service and/or file abuse reports with the Internet Service Provider associated with that IP address if we have reason to believe criminal activities are
involved. We connect IP addresses to submitted files so we can, according to server load demands, apply limits to how often a certain visitor can submit a file for scanning.
The information mentioned in this paragraph is not shared with other parties, unless such should be ordered by the court of law, except, as stated above, in cases that we can
reasonably assume a visitor is abusing this service for criminal purposes, in which scenario we will file abuse reports with the IP block's owner, reports which will inheritently
include information mentioned in this paragraph (because, what good is an abuse report without an IP address).

We use cookies - small files containing short texts - to store preferences on your computer. We use these preferences for your convenience; for example, we may store which
language you last chose to display certain pages in and use that information to display webpages in that language the next time you visit. We do not use these cookies to
identify computers or individuals or companies.

We (temporarily) store files you send in for scanning and share these with anti-malware companies. We do this for one simple reason: to help anti-malware companies improve
detection accuracy in their security products. We treat your files confidentially (we have better things to do than reading thousands of files each day) and although we trust
the participating anti-malware companies receiving your files will do the same, we cannot exercise control over the actions these anti-malware companies take. Your files will
probably be analysed (and therefore: read) by security analysts. If you do not want other people or companies reading your files, please do not send these files in for scanning.
The period of time submitted files are retained depends on the amount of submissions and the number of anti-malware companies detecting the samples. This is done to provide you,
as the original submitter or submitters, with the opportunity to rescan the files at a later time without having to send them in again, e.g. to see when AV companies ship detection
updates for the files in question, and to be of better service to anti-malware companies. Files are not shared with entities outside the anti-virus/security industry.

Our advertisers may collect information you voluntarily provide them with (such as browser, operating system and IP addresses) and use this information to provide you with
targeted ads. For example, if the IP address you currently use originates from Finland, our advertisers may present you with Finnish ads or ads about current events in Finland.

------------------
In a nutshell: we are not spying on you, we are not unreasonable, we have no desire to find out who you are, and we do nothing else that we would not want done to ourselves. 
As long as you do not severely abuse our service, the only things we share with other parties are the files you send in for scanning (and these we share with
security companies only). The only information we store and use is broad statistical data, not connected or traceable to a living person or a company, and the files you send in
for scanning, to be reviewed by security analysts in order to improve detection accuracy in their anti-malware products.</pre></body></html>
