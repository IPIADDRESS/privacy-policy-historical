<p>We use your information primarily as necessary to provide you with the Services, including in one or</p>
<p>more of the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Service Support and Improvement.</strong> We may use your personal information to create your account,</p>
<p>allow use of our Services, suggest and make connections with other users, enable user-to- user</p>
<p>communications, provide technical support and respond to user inquiries, and analyze what our</p>
<p>users prefer, so that we can design better products and services. We may analyze the information</p>
<p>that is collected with cookies and other tracking technologies to help us improve our function and to</p>
<p>modify the services and information that we provide.</p>
<p><strong>Communications.</strong> We also use your information to communicate with you about your inquiries, our</p>
<p>company, and related news, as well as to send you promotional emails, surveys, newsletters, or</p>
<p>notifications. If you have provided your email address or phone number to us, we may use it to</p>
<p>respond to (i) customer support inquiries, and (ii) keep you informed of your activity, including</p>
<p>comments from friends, notifications about application status. Additionally, if you have chosen to</p>
<p>synchronize your mobile device contacts with our Services, your decision may initiate SMS</p>
<p>notifications directly to your friends to invite them to our Services and alert them to relevant</p>
<p>application activity. To invite your friends to join you in using our applications and other Services,</p>
<p>the messages sent to your friends may include your name, school network and profile photo. We</p>
<p>may send promotional email messages and SMS messages directly or in partnership with parties</p>
<p>other than Juxta. These messages notify you of application activity, provide application updates and</p>
<p>other relevant information and may allow you to use the applicable application on your phone. The</p>
<p>sending of SMS notifications may be handled through a third party service provider.</p>
<p>With your consent, we may send push notifications to your mobile device to provide application</p>
<p>updates and other relevant messages. You may be able to manage push notifications from the</p>
<p>applicable application or from your device’s settings. Some of our Services have direct messaging</p>
<p>features built in (In-Band Messages). When available, we may send In-Band Messages directly to</p>
<p>your mobile device to notify you of application activity, advertisements, offers and other relevant</p>
<p>communication.</p>
<p><strong>Fraud Prevention and Legal Compliance.</strong> We may use your information to prevent fraud or</p>
<p>potentially illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>Customized User Experiences.</strong> We may use your personal information to create customized</p>
<p>experiences, or to provide you information or services tailored to your interests and preferences.</p>
<p>We may use your IP address and other similar information to make our Services easier to use and</p>
<p>navigate as well as to personalize the content provided on the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Product Improvement:</strong> If you choose to download our apps, subscribe to our products, participate in</p>
<p>our online services, or to register for other Juxta products or services, we will collect the</p>
<p>information that you disclose and analyze the data to discover new facts that could help us better</p>
<p>understand our products and services. We may use this information for our internal business</p>
<p>purposes, such as research to improve our products and analyses that may help us better market our</p>
<p>products.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising, Marketing, and Promotions:</strong> We may use your information for generating web</p>
<p>analytics to compile user information for marketing purposes, advertising, conducting marketing</p>
<p>analysis, providing you with recommendations for products or services based on your profile, and</p>
<p>promotional material planning and distribution. In particular, we may use your information to</p>
<p>deliver and target advertising, to notify users of application updates, to provide application leader</p>
<p>boards and promote application user achievements, to solicit input and feedback to improve our</p>
<p>products and services, and to inform users about new products or promotional offers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Sharing Your Information</strong></h4>
<p>We may share your personal information, with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of your profile information may be exposed publicly when you participate in the Services such as</p>
<p>by posting content, chatting with other users, or commenting on content. This includes: your name,</p>
<p>profile photos, username, school or network name, bio and descriptions of your activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your information and your online communications may be accessed and monitored as necessary to</p>
<p>provide the Services and may be disclosed or reported: (i) if we have a good faith belief that we are</p>
<p>required to disclose the information by law, (ii) in response to legal process (for example, a court order,</p>
<p>search warrant or subpoena); (ii) to satisfy applicable laws, (iii) if we believe that the Services are being</p>
<p>used to commit a crime, (iii) including, but not limited to, to report such criminal activity or to</p>
<p>exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and</p>
<p>credit risk reduction, (iv) if we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to</p>
<p>the health or safety of a person or the general public, and (v) in order to protect the rights or property of</p>
<p>Juxta, including to enforce our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you give us your consent, we may actively share personal information with third party advertisers for</p>
<p>their direct marketing purposes. We may share aggregated or anonymous information and certain</p>
<p>technical information to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Services and on the websites of</p>
<p>third parties. We may also allow advertisers to collect those types of information within the Services</p>
<p>and they may share it with us. We may use this information for behavioral advertising and for web</p>
<p>analytics. Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymous or aggregated information are not subject to</p>
<p>any of the restrictions in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may display an “offer wall” that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third</p>
<p>party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement</p>
<p>or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those</p>
<p>advertisers. These are not offers made by us. We may display these offers to you based on certain</p>
<p>information, such as your geographic area or anonymous demographic information. If you click on one</p>
<p>of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Juxta or a partnering SNS.</p>
<p>We may provide your information to third party companies to perform services on our behalf, including</p>
<p>payment processing, data analysis, message delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing.</p>
<p>If we sell all or a portion of our business, we may transfer all of your information, including personal</p>
<p>information, to the successor organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Security of Your Information</strong></h4>
<p>We implement security measures we believe are reasonable to protect your information. It is</p>
<p>important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and you need to immediately</p>
<p>notify us of any unauthorized use of your account. No website, mobile application or Internet</p>
<p>transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data</p>
<p>loss, or other breaches or other type of misuse will never occur. We may post a notice via the Services</p>
<p>if a security breach occurs. We may also send you notice by the contact information you have</p>
<p>provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to</p>
<p>receive written notice of a data privacy or security breach. If you have reason to believe that your</p>
<p>personal information that we have collected or our Services’ security has been breached, please notify</p>
<p>us by <a href="http://support@juxtalabs.com.">support@juxtalabs.com.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Accessing and Controlling Your Information</strong></h4>
<p>If you have accounts on our Services you can access and edit the information you provided to us</p>
<p>through individual settings in the Services. If you want to delete your accounts and information on our</p>
<p>Services, please contact us directly at: <a href="http://support@juxtalabs.com.">support@juxtalabs.com.</a>. To manage the information we receive</p>
<p>about you from an SNS you will need to follow the instructions at that the SNS. Once we receive your</p>
<p>information from an SNS, that information is stored and used by us in accordance with this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Opting Out of Marketing Communications</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, you may opt-out of commercial communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in an</p>
<p>email or by replying “STOP” to text messages. We will process your requests as soon as possible, but</p>
<p>please be aware that it may take us some time to respond to your request and, in some circumstances</p>
<p>regarding opt-out requests, you may receive a few more messages until your request is processed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Our Policy Toward Children</strong></h4>
<p>Our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from such children. Children under the age of 13 should not use our Services at</p>
<p>any time. If we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child under the</p>
<p>age of 13 we will delete such information as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>International Operations and Information Transfer</strong></h4>
<p>We may transfer data to foreign affiliates, partners or vendors. If you are located outside of the United</p>
<p>States of America and choose to use our Services and share information with us, we may transfer your</p>
<p>data across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to the United States or other countries or</p>
<p>jurisdictions around the world, and process it there. If you are visiting from Canada, the European</p>
<p>Union, or other jurisdictions with laws governing data protection that may differ from United States</p>
<p>law, please note that you are transferring your personal information to the United States which does not</p>
<p>have the same data protection laws as your country and which may provide more limited recourse</p>
<p>mechanisms, including dissimilar or, at times, weaker data protection rights. With knowledge of these</p>
<p>risks, by providing your personal information you consent to: (1) the use of your personal information</p>
<p>for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and (2) the transfer of your</p>
<p>personal information to the United States and other countries as indicated above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Third Party Apps and Websites</strong></h4>
<p>Our Services may link to third-party apps and websites from companies other than Juxta that may link</p>
<p>to their own websites, such as offer wall providers. We are not responsible for the privacy practices,</p>
<p>security, or the content of such websites. If you have any questions about how these other websites use</p>
<p>your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly. We are not responsible for</p>
<p>the actions of third-party advertisers and service providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Third Party Advertisers</strong></h4>
<p>We may use advertisers, third party ad networks, and other advertising companies to serve</p>
<p>advertisements on the Services. Please be advised that such advertising companies may gather</p>
<p>information about your visit to the Services or other websites (such as through cookies, web beacons,</p>
<p>and other technologies) to enable such advertising companies to market products or services to you, to</p>
<p>monitor which ads have been served to your browser and which webpages you were viewing when such</p>
<p>ads were delivered. If you would like to learn more about this practice, and know your choices with</p>
<p>respect to it, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">please visit here</a>.</p>
<p>AGAIN, PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION</p>
<p>AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH THIRD PARTY SITES AND ADVERTISERS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Assignment</strong></h4>
<p>In the event that all or part of our assets are sold or acquired by another party, or in the event of a</p>
<p>merger, you grant us the right to assign your personal information collected via the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong></h4>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to our Privacy</p>
<p>Policy, we will notify you and other users by posting the changes on the Juxta Labs Services or by</p>
<p>using the contact information you have on file with us and will indicate when such changes will become</p>
<p>effective. By continuing to use our Services you are agreeing to be bound by any changes or revisions</p>
<p>made to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>California Privacy Rights &amp;amp; How We Respond to Do-Not- Track Disclosures</strong></h4>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits visitors to the Services who are California residents to</p>
<p>request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their</p>
<p>direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at the address provided at the</p>
<p>bottom of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you</p>
<p>affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by “opting in” to receive information from a third party</p>
<p>that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our Services. If you do ask us to</p>
<p>share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share</p>
<p>information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third</p>
<p>party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis.</p>
<p>At this time our Services do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms,</p>
<p>which may include ‘do not track’ instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></h4>
<p>By visiting the Services or otherwise using the Services, you and we agree that, if there is any</p>
<p>controversy, claim, action or dispute arising out of or related to any transaction conducted on the</p>
<p>Services, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of the Privacy Policy&nbsp;or any part of them</p>
<p>(collectively, a &amp;quot;Dispute&amp;quot;), both parties shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing</p>
<p>written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the</p>
<p>receiving party thirty (30) days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice shall be sent:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To Juxta Labs Inc., 525 Brannan St. Suite 408, San Francisco, CA 94107,</p>
<p>ATTN: Legal Department, or</p>
<p>To you at: your contact information that we have on file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both you and we agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be</p>
<p>satisfied before initiating any litigation or filing any claim against the other party.</p>
<p>IF ANY DISPUTE CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY THE ABOVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE, YOU AGREE</p>
<p>THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION FOR SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE DECIDED BY BINDING</p>
<p>ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU</p>
<p>WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND</p>
<p>THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. Other rights</p>
<p>that you and we would have in court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including</p>
<p>discovery and appeal rights. All such Disputes shall be determined by arbitration in the San Francisco,</p>
<p>CA area, exclusively submitted to JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) for binding arbitration under its rules then</p>
<p>in effect, before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve</p>
<p>any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of</p>
<p>the&nbsp;Privacy Policy, including any claim that all or any part of the&nbsp;Privacy Policy is void or voidable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
