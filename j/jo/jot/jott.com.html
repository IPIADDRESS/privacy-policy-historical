    Jott Privacy Policy
  </div>	        
  <strong>As of August 1st, 2007<br><br> 
  At Jott Networks we recognize that privacy is important. This Policy applies to all of the sites and services offered by Jott Networks Inc..</strong><br><br>
  
  <h2>Information we collect and how we use it</h2>
  <div class="breaker"></div>
  
  <p>In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><b>Information you provide - </b> When you sign up for a Jott account or other Jott service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, a phone number, email address, and an account password). We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Jott services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience, to display relevant advertising, for product research and development, and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. </li>

    <li><b>Jott.com cookies - </b> When you visit web pages associated with Jott Services, we may send cookies that identify your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service. If you do not want cookies to be set, you can usually set your browser to prevent this, or to give you the option of setting it. If you choose not to have a cookie saved, please be aware that some Jott Services may not work.</li>

    <li><b>Log information - </b> When you use Jott Services, our servers automatically record information given by browsers and phone systems, such as browser types, phone numbers, IP addresses, linking paths, etc. We may use this information in order to provide you with a better experience, to display relevant advertising, for product research and development, and to improve the quality of our services.</li>

    <li><b>User created jotts and other communications - </b> When you create a Jott either by phone, email, sms, instant messaging or otherwise, we may retain that data in order to offer our service, display relevant advertising, process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</li>

    <li><b>Affiliated sites - </b> We may offer some services in connection with other web sites or third parties. To the extent that we receive data from these 3rd parties, we treat that data in accordance with this privacy policy. These 3rd party sites may have different privacy practices than Jott and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. </li>

    <li><b>Other sites - </b> This Privacy Policy applies to web sites and services that are owned and operated by Jott Networks Inc. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results or links from within our various services.

Jott may allow you to interact with other services, including using JottLinks, the Jott API, as well as email. Jott does not control how sites you choose to use with Jott use data you provide. We strongly encourage you to read their privacy policies.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
    <li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service and investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Jott, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
  </ul>
