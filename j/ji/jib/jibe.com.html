        <p>*Personally Identifiable Information:* JIBE will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others. JIBE may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you. If we do this, such third parties use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of JIBE (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>
        <p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>
        <p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.</p>
        <p>From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.</p>
        <p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, JIBE will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use http://www.jibe.com/tos, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of JIBE, our Users or others.</p>

        <p>JIBE may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on JIBE. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. JIBE does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks JIBE to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The JIBE Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
        <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
        <p>JIBE uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information and implement your privacy settings. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to JIBE or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of JIBE's distributors, such as social networks. JIBE is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.</p>
        <p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from JIBE, at all times. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at info@jibe.com.</p>
        <h2>Compromise of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, JIBE will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
        <h2>Your Choices About Your Information</h2>
        <p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case JIBE may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update, delete or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your account and http://www.jibe.com/settings. You can review and correct the information about you that JIBE keeps on file by contacting us directly at support@JIBE.com. We will respond to your requests for access within 30 days.</p>
        <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, JIBE does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register as Members. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on JIBE. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@JIBE.com.</p>
        <h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
        <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
        <h2>Facebook Connect, LinkedIn or other OpenID provider</h2>
        <p>You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect, LinkedIn or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form and allow you to apply to jobs through our service. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network. To revoke JIBE access to OpenID providers, please go to the provider site and disable JIBE access.</p>
        <h2>Notification Procedures</h2>
        <p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by JIBE in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on the Service to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
