                    <h3>Information That Customers Provide To Us Through “Jibe Enterprise Services”:</h3>
                    <p>
                      In providing Jibe Enterprise Services, we collect, store, process, and disclose personal information belonging to individuals who are involved in recruiting or employment activities with our Customers (e.g., job applicants, job referrers, an applicant's social-networking connections who are employed by a Customer).  In all of these cases, our software has been integrated into a Customer Recruiting System and we are handling personal information solely on behalf of the Customer, and in accordance with our agreements with the Customer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you are interacting in recruiting or employment contexts with one of our Customers, please review the Customer's privacy policy, terms of use or other notices to learn more about the Customer's information practices, including its use of service providers like Jibe.

                    <p>
                      For your information, here are some examples of how Jibe collects and uses information in the course of providing Jibe Enterprise Services to our Customers:
                      </p><ul>
                        <li>Jibe Enterprise Services may facilitate the job application process through the Customer's Customer Recruiting System, and in that capacity Jibe may receive personal information of individuals (i.e., job applicants) requested by the Customer's application, including for example, an individual's name, contact information, and employment history. Jibe handles this information solely on behalf of the Customer and our use, retention and deletion of the personal information is governed by our agreements with the Customer.</li>
                        <li>Jibe Enterprise Services allow Customers to provide individuals (e.g., job applicants) the ability to use information from social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn).  If you utilize this feature, then you are giving us permission to collect and share information about you, your friends, and your contacts (which may also include information such as your profile picture, interests, work experience, and education) to provide Jibe Enterprise Services to our Customer.  You should always review the social networking site's privacy policy, terms of use or other notices, as well as your privacy settings with the social networking site, to learn more about the site's information practices (e.g., what information the site allows third parties to access).</li>
                        <li>Jibe Enterprise Services may request contact information from your friends as part of the Service we provide to our Customers. For example, our Customers may provide an invitation service for individuals to share job listings with each other or to request referrals.  If you utilize these features, you will input another person's name and email address and we or our third party service providers will send an email or message via your social network to this person on your behalf.   Jibe may store this information on behalf of our Customer to send this email or message, to provide the Service to our Customer, and to track the success of this Service.</li>
