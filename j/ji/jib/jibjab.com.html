<h4>Last Updated: April 25, 2006</h4>

<p>At JibJab Media Inc. ("JibJab"), we respect your right to privacy and
we understand that members and visitors to JibJab need to control the uses of
their personal information. The privacy policy below details the measures taken
by JibJab to protect your privacy in connection with your use of JibJab.com.
However, JibJab's service is designed to allow users to post photographs
and information about themselves for public review and comment. Accordingly, by submitting your photograph
and/or any personal information, you thereby waive any privacy expectations you
have with respect to our use of your likeness or personal information provided
to us. If you do not wish to have your picture or information about yourself
viewed by or disclosed to others, do not use our Service. </p>


<p>JibJab also allows our
members to set up unique personal profiles that can be linked together through
networks of friends. JibJab members can view each others' profiles, communicate
with old friends and meet new friends on the service, share photos, post
journals and comments, and describe their interests. To enrich our members'
experience, we request and display some personal information to other members
and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their
network of friends. JibJab members can change their profile information at any
time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them. 
</p>

<p>From time to time we may
make changes to our privacy policy. If
we make changes, we will post them to our Privacy Statement, linkable from any
page on our site to make users aware of what the changes are so users will be
aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose
it. Please re-read it often in
connection with your use of the JibJab Sites. JibJab cares deeply about online privacy. If
you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at
<a href="mailto:support@jibjab.net">support@jibjab.net</a>

</p><h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
<p>JibJab collects user
submitted information such as name, email address, and age (except with respect
to any information submitted by any individuals thirteen years of age or
younger, which information JibJab does not solicit, accept or retain) to
authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the
JibJab service. JibJab also collects other data including but not limited to:
personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation in order to assist
users in finding and communicating with each other and making content
recommendation.</p>

<p>JibJab also logs
non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile
information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to
the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the
website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared
with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to
members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes </p>

<p>User Profile information
including members' pictures and usernames are displayed to people in order to
facilitate user interaction in JibJab's social networking community. Email
addresses are primarily used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join
JibJab, to add users to members' friends' networks, and to send notifications
related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends,
and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people
within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate
on JibJab with each other through the JibJab service, without disclosing their
email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other
members. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the
service, JibJab allows users to search for other members using first and last
name, email address, and schools and/or companies where users may have attended
or worked. </p>

<p>We may also use a user's
email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service.
Users may choose not to receive communication of this type by changing their
"Email Preferences" settings in the user "Account
Settings". </p>

<p>From time to time, JibJab
or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on the JibJab
Site(s). Users may be asked to provide personal information including name,
email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate.
We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have
explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point
of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy
statement will apply. </p>

<h4>Use of Cookies </h4>
<p>JibJab uses cookies to
store visitors' preferences and to record session information, for purposes
including ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same
advertisements and to customize newsletter, advertising, and Web page content
based on browser type and user profile information. You may be able to

<h4>Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members </h4>

<p>JibJab members can invite
friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated
invitation system. JibJab stores the email addresses that members provide so
that the respondents may be added to the friends list of the member sending the
invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. JibJab also stores
names and email addresses provided by members when they forward e-mails
(together with any content contained therein) from their friends to their "Joke
Box" account solely for the convenience of that member in communicating with
his/her friends in the future. JibJab does not sell these email addresses or
use them to send any other communication besides invitations initiated by the
member and invitation reminders initiated by JibJab (one (1) per email
address). Recipients of invitations from JibJab may contact JibJab to request
the removal of their information from our database by clicking on the "Opt-Out"
Link at the bottom of our emails. JibJab members may also store email addresses
of people they know in their internal JibJab address book and may also choose
to send invitations and other communications to those addresses. </p>
			
<p>You may prevent JibJab
email invitations and other messages from being sent to any email address you
control by sending an email request to 
<a href="mailto:support@jibjab.net">support@jibjab.net</a> or
<a href="https://tools.jibjab.com/optout/optout">click here</a>
to get to our "Opt-Out" page on the site. Please note that the email must come
from the account you wish to block. </p>
