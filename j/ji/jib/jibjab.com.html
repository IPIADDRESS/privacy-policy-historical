	  <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <h3>Last Updated: October 13, 2008</h3>
    <p>At JibJab Media Inc. ("JibJab"), 
    we respect your right to privacy and we understand that members and 
    visitors to JibJab need to control the uses of their personal information. 
    The privacy policy below details the measures taken by JibJab to protect 
    your privacy in connection with your use of JibJab.com. However, JibJab's 
    service is designed to allow users to post photographs and information 
    about themselves for public review and comment. Accordingly, by submitting 
    your photograph and/or any personal information, you thereby waive any 
    privacy expectations you have with respect to our use of your likeness 
    or personal information provided to us. If you do not wish to have your 
    picture or information about yourself viewed by or disclosed to others, 
    do not use our Service.</p>
    <p>JibJab also allows our members 
    to set up unique personal profiles that can be linked together through 
    networks of friends. JibJab members can view each others' profiles, 
    communicate with old friends and meet new friends on the service, share 
    photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests. To 
    enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal 
    information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to 
    identify each other and expand their network of friends. JibJab members 
    can change their profile information at any time and can control how 
    other members and the service communicates with them.</p>
    <p>By using JibJab.com, you affirmatively 
    consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to have your personal information 
    (to the extent voluntarily disclosed by you) collected by JibJab (or 
    its agents or contractors) and transferred to and processed in the United 
    States.</p>
    <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
    <p>JibJab collects user submitted 
    information such as name, email address, and age to authenticate users 
    and to send notifications to those users relating to the JibJab service. 
    JibJab also collects other data including but not limited to: personal 
    interests, gender, age, education and occupation in order to assist 
    users in finding and communicating with each other and making content 
    recommendation.</p>
    <p>JibJab also logs non-personally-identifiable 
    information such as IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type, 
    from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the 
    website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable 
    information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant 
    services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses are recorded 
    for security and monitoring purposes </p>
    <p>User Profile information including 
    members' pictures and usernames are displayed to people in order to 
    facilitate user interaction in JibJab's social networking community. 
    Email addresses are primarily used for the purposes of inviting new 
    friends to join JibJab, to add users to members' friends' networks, 
    and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception 
    of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a user's email 
    address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal 
    network. Users within a personal network communicate on JibJab with 
    each other through the JibJab service, without disclosing their email 
    addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members. 
    To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the 
    service, JibJab allows users to search for other members using first 
    and last name, email address, and schools and/or companies where users 
    may have attended or worked.</p>
    <p>When you create an account 
    and become a member of JibJab, we will send you a “verification” 
    email to ask you to verify your email address and account by following 
    the instructions provided in the email.&nbsp; Such verification is necessary 
    to complete your registration and activate your account.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    It is important that you verify your email address so that we may communicate 
    with you regarding your account, your purchases and/or other transactions 
    with JibJab, changes in our Terms of Service, Terms of Sale and/or Privacy 
    Policy, and other matters relating to your membership with JibJab.&nbsp; 
    It also enables us to send you marketing emails about our new content, 
    features, services, products, promotions, etc.&nbsp; You may opt out 
    of receiving marketing emails from us at any time, by following the 
    opt-out link contained in a marketing email you previously received, 
    or by logging into the “My Account” section of our website and changing 
    your email preferences in the account settings.&nbsp; If you do not 
    provide verification within 2 days after we send the initial verification 
    email, we will send one reminder email to you.&nbsp; If there is still 
    no verification by you within 2 days after we send the reminder email, 
    we will consider your registration/account incomplete and inactive.&nbsp; 
    If your registration/account status remains incomplete and inactive 
    for more than 7 days after your initial registration, we reserve the 
    right to cancel your registration/account without notice.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>From time to time, JibJab or 
    a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on the JibJab 
    Site(s). Users may be asked to provide personal information including 
    name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order 
    to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners 
    that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will 
    be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information 
    and whose privacy statement will apply.</p>
    <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
    <p>JibJab uses cookies to store 
    visitors' preferences and to record session information, for purposes 
    including ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same 
    advertisements and to customize newsletter, advertising, and Web page 
    content based on browser type and user profile information. You may 
    be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, 
    or notify you when a cookie is set — each browser is different, so 
    check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change 
    your cookie preferences — however, you must enable cookies from JibJab 
    in order to use most functions on the site. Please note that JibJab 
    allows 3rd party advertisers that are presenting advertisements on some 
    of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Advertisers' 
    use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the JibJab 
    Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h3>Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members</h3>
    <p>JibJab members can invite friends 
    to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation 
    system. JibJab stores the email addresses that members provide so that 
    the respondents may be added to the friends list of the member sending 
    the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. JibJab 
    also stores names and email addresses provided by members when they 
    forward e-mails (together with any content contained therein) from their 
    friends to their "JokeBox" account solely for the convenience 
    of that member in communicating with his/her friends in the future. 
    JibJab does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other 
    communication besides invitations initiated by the member and invitation 
    reminders initiated by JibJab (one (1) per email address). Recipients 
    of invitations from JibJab may contact JibJab to request the removal 
    of their information from our database by clicking on the "Opt-Out" 
    Link at the bottom of our emails. JibJab members may also store email 
    addresses of people they know in their internal JibJab address book 
    and may also choose to send invitations and other communications to 
    those addresses.</p>
    <p>You may prevent JibJab email 
    invitations and other messages from being sent to any email address 
    you control by sending an email request to <a href="mailto:support@jibjab.net">support@jibjab.net</a> or by <a href="http://www.jibjab.com/opt_out">clicking 
    here</a> to get to 
    our "Opt-Out" page on the site. Please note that the email 
    must come from the account you wish to block.</p>
    <h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>
    <p>Ads appearing on this Web site 
    may be delivered to users by JibJab or one of our Web advertising partners. 
    Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the 
    ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online 
    advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about 
    where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements 
    and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad 
    network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be 
    of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies 
    by JibJab and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
    <h3>Agents</h3>
    <p>We use a third party company 
    to pack and ship products ordered in the JibJab online store. Our fulfillment 
    company has access to your full name and shipping address to complete 
    this transaction but does not retain, share, store or use personally 
    identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>
    <h3>Service Providers</h3>
    <p>We use PayPal to process payments. When you checkout of our store, you will 
    be asked to enter your First Name, Last Name, Credit Card Information, Billing
    and Shipping Address as necessary to complete your transaction.  JibJab does not
    store any of our users credit card information in our database.</p>
    <p>These third parties are prohibited 
    from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose 
    other than providing the above-described contracted services.</p>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>JibJab contains links to third-party 
    sites. JibJab is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices 
    on other sites. When linking to another site a user should read the 
    privacy policy stated on that site. Our privacy policy only governs 
    information collected on the JibJab Site(s).</p>
    <h3>Public Communication</h3>
    <p>Please be aware that whenever 
    you voluntarily post public information on the JibJab Site(s) that that 
    information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by 
    those people to send you unsolicited communications. We are not responsible 
    for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in 
    these forums.</p>
    <h3>Correcting/Updating or Removing Information</h3>
    <p>JibJab users may modify or 
    remove any of their personal information at any time by logging into 
    their account and accessing features such as "My Profile" 
    and "Account Settings".</p>
    <h3>Email Choice/Opt-out</h3>
    <p>Members may choose to no longer 
    receive updates or notifications by managing their email preferences; 
    in the user profile 'Account Settings'. All notification emails and 
    JibJab newsletters include instructions for opting-out of those communications 
    in the future.</p>
    <h3>Security </h3>
    <p>JibJab member accounts are 
    secured by member-created passwords. JibJab takes precautions to ensure 
    that member account information is kept private. We use commercially 
    reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within 
    our database, and we restrict access to member information to those 
    employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our 
    customer service personnel and technical staff.&nbsp; When members submit 
    their personal information or log into their accounts on JibJab.com, 
    the information transmitted is protected by industry standard encryption.&nbsp; 
    For any additional information about the security measures we use on 
    JibJab, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@jibjab.net">support@jibjab.net</a>.&nbsp; However, we do not guarantee 
    that these efforts will completely protect member account information.&nbsp; 
    Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors 
    may compromise the security of member information at any time.&nbsp; 
    We will endeavor to notify members in the event that the security of 
    their personal information is breached or compromised.&nbsp; By submitting 
    personal information on our Web site, you expressly consent to receiving 
    our notification regarding any breach or compromise, or suspected breach 
    or compromise, of the security of your personal information, by email 
    or postal mail, as we deem appropriate, and as required by law.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>We urge you to keep your username, 
    password, and other account access information in a safe place and not 
    to divulge it to anyone.&nbsp; Also, remember to sign off your account 
    and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.&nbsp; 
    This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially 
    if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer 
    in a public place such as a library or an internet cafe.</p>
    <h3>Sharing and Disclosure of Information JibJab Collects</h3>
    <p>Except as otherwise described 
    in this privacy statement, JibJab will not disclose personal information 
    to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) 
    to comply with applicable law or to respond to a subpoena, court order, 
    search warrant or other legal process received by JibJab, whether or 
    not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to protect or enforce 
    our rights or the rights of a third party; (3) to protect the safety 
    of members of the public and users of the service; or (4) to respond 
    to an emergency.&nbsp; JibJab reserves the right to transfer personal 
    information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that 
    information as a result of the sale of JibJab or substantially all of 
    JibJab’s assets to that successor in interest.&nbsp; JibJab also reserves 
    the right to disclose personal information as necessary to enable third-party 
    service providers to support and maintain the operation of JibJab.com 
    and JibJab’s service. You will be notified via e-mail of any such 
    change in ownership or control of your personal information.&nbsp; For
