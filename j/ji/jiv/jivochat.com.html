This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to those who visit the websites owned and operated by the Company, download any downloadable software, install any mobile applications, and/or use the Company’s products and Jivochat Service offered at jivochat.com, jivochat.com.br, jivochat.es, jivochat.de, jivochat.ng, jivochat.co.ke, jivochat.co.za, jivochat.mx, jivochat.co.id, jivochat.com.co, jivochat.com.ar, jivochat.com.pe, jivochat.cl, jivochat.com.bo, jivochat.com.ve, jivochat.co.in, jivochat.pt (collectively, the “Jivochat Service”). For purposes of this Policy, personal data shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This might be by reference to an identifier such as a name, ID number, location data or online identifier, or by factors specific to them, such as their physical, genetic, economic or social identity.</p> <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Company collects, uses, shares and secures the personal data of the subscribers to the Jivochat Service (the “Subscriber(s)” or “you” or “yours”, as applicable). It also describes the Subscriber’s choices regarding use, access and correction of the Subscriber’s personal data. The capitalized terms used in this Policy but not defined herein shall have the same meaning assigned to them in Company’s Terms and Conditions (jivochat.com/terms) (the “Terms”).</p> <p> <strong>NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBER’S OBJECTS</strong>:&nbsp; If a Subscriber uses the Jivochat Service to interact with other individuals, such as the Subscriber’s customers or potential customers (the “Subscriber’s Objects”), the Subscriber is solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws in connection with the collection and/or processing of personal data of the Subscriber’s Objects.&nbsp; If you are a Subscriber’s Object please note that the Company has no relationship with you whatsoever and its only relation is with the Subscriber with whom you may interact.&nbsp; For any questions regarding the collection of your personal data or to amend your personal data, and for all other reasons, you must contact the Subscriber. &nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBERS</strong>:&nbsp; Please note that the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to the Subscriber if the Subscriber collects personal data of the Subscribers’ Objects and any of the following two criteria are met:&nbsp; (i) the processing of personal data is done in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the EU, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not; or (ii) the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the EU by a controller or processor not established in the EU, where the processing activities are related to: (a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the EU; or (b) the monitoring of their behavior as far as their behavior takes place within the EU. Because the Company does not collect or determine the use of any personal data of Subscriber Objects, nor the purpose for which such data is collected by the Subscriber, how such data is collected and how it is used, the Company does not act as a data controller as defined under GDPR and bears no responsibility under the GDPR associated with a data controller.&nbsp; To the extent that the Company processes any Subscriber Object’s data, it should be considered only as a processor on behalf of the Subscriber as to any personal data that is subject to the requirements of GDPR. Please note that under GDPR you are regarded as a data controller <em>vis a vis</em> the Subscriber Objects and as such must comply with the requirements of GDPR.&nbsp; While you may employ your own privacy policy, you agree and acknowledge that for as long as you use the Jivochat Service and are subject to the GDPR, you must comply with the GDPR requirements. Your obligations (which extend to your employees, agents, subcontractors, etc., collectively your “Personnel”) include, but are not limited to (i) promptly (and under no circumstances after seventy two hours) notifying the Company of becoming aware of any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed or any investigation by a governmental authority concerning your handling of personal data; (ii) promptly and in good faith responding to any inquiries or requests by the Company regarding the collection and/or processing of personal data by you; (iii) maintaining relevant records of collecting and/or processing of personal data subject to GDPR; (iv) transferring or processing the personal data outside the EU or European Economic Area in compliance with GDPR and with prior written notification of the Company;&nbsp; and (v) ensuring that your Personnel is aware of and complies with the foregoing obligations.&nbsp; The Company is under no circumstances obligated to, but reserves the right to monitor (and audit) the Subscriber’s compliance with the foregoing. In the event that the Subscriber ceases to use the Jivochat Service, the Subscriber must permanently delete the personal data of the Subscriber Objects that was collected through the Jivochat Service. To the extent that the Company suffers any losses as a result of the breach by the Subscriber of the foregoing obligations or failure to abide by the foregoing obligations, the Subscriber shall hold harmless and shall fully indemnify the Company from such losses. The Company is not responsible for the content of any personal data of Subscriber Objects or any other information that is stored on the Company’s or its third party suppliers’ servers at the discretion of the Subscriber.&nbsp; The Company owes no responsibility and bears no liability vis a vis the Subscriber’s Objects.&nbsp; If you need a signed Data Processing Agreement in addition to this Policy and the Terms, please contact us at privacy@jivochat.com.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>DATA TRANSFER</h4> <p>The Company is a global company, based in the United States.&nbsp; As such, we may transfer and access such personal information from around the world, including from other countries.&nbsp; In transferring your personal information, we will rely on lawful measures to transfer your personal information outside the EEA and Switzerland.
