<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Our Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, Web Analytics Services, and Links</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul class="disc">
<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> Many of our web pages use “cookies.” Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services. You have many choices with regards to the management of cookies on your computer. All major browsers allow you to block or delete cookies from your system. To learn more about your ability to manage cookies, please consult the privacy features in your browser.</li>
<li><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Jive and third parties may also use small pieces of code called “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These “web beacons” may be used to deliver cookies that conform to Jive’s cookie requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Web Analytics Services.</strong> We use Google Analytics, a service for the marketing analysis of the site provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to allow us to see how you use our site, so we can improve your experience. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use available at <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</a> and the Google Privacy Policy available at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.

<li><strong>Website Links.</strong> We may create links to other web sites. We will make a reasonable effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual’s right to privacy. However, many other sites that are not associated with or authorized by Jive may have links leading to our site. Jive cannot control these links and we are not responsible for any content appearing on these sites. Since this website does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy practices of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose any personal information to others.</li>
<li><strong>App Links.</strong> A given application may provide you with an advertising link to other, third-party sites and applications. Such third-party sites will have their own data collection practices and policies. Please review the privacy policy for such sites and exercise caution in providing information that personally identifies you. We have no responsibility, access, or control over the data collection practices and policies of such third-party sites and applications. You will use such sites and applications at your own risk and outside of the scope of this Privacy Policy. The provision of such advertisements is done on an “As Is” basis, with no endorsements or representations.</li>
<li><strong>Other.</strong> Jive websites may use third parties to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at its web pages and to conduct research about the advertisements and web usage. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from you or the methods used by the third parties to collect that information.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Legal Basis for Processing your Personal Data (EEA and Switzerland only)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With respect to personal data collected from individuals from the European Economic Area or Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Jive will normally collect personal data from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the services you have requested), or (c) where the processing is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms).</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Limiting Use, Disclosure, Retention </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Jive identifies the purposes for which the information is being collected before or at the time of collection. The collection of your personal data will be limited to that which is needed for the purposes identified by Jive. Unless you consent, or we are required by law, we will only use the personal data for the purposes for which it was collected. If Jive will be processing your personal data for another purpose later on, Jive will seek your further legal permission or consent; except where the other purpose is compatible with the original purpose. We will keep your personal data only as long as required to serve those purposes. We will also retain and use your personal data for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>International Transfers of your Personal data</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We are a global company. Information collected from you may be stored and processed in the European Economic Area, the United States or any other country in which Jive or agents or contractors maintain facilities, and by accessing our sites and using our services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Such countries may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country.</p>
<p>Whenever we share personal data originating in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, we will rely on lawful measures to transfer that data, such as the Privacy Shield or the EU standard contractual clauses. If you reside in the EEA or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal data to the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. By providing your personal data, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>&nbsp; Accuracy of Personal data</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We do our best to ensure that the personal data we hold and use is accurate. We rely on the customers we do business with to disclose to us all relevant information and to inform us of any changes.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>&nbsp; Your Access to and Updating of your Personal data</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Reasonable access to your personal data may be provided upon request made to Jive at the contact information provided below. If access cannot be provided within that time frame, Jive will provide the requesting party a date when the information will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, we will provide an explanation as to why access has been denied. We may charge a reasonable fee in advance for copying and sending the information requested.</p>
<p>If you would like us to delete any persona Data held about you, we will do so on request unless we need to hold the information as part of the provision of products and services to you.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong>Marketing Communications</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We offer those who provide personal contact information a means to choose how we use the information provided. You may manage your receipt of marketing and non- transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of our marketing emails.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>Additional Rights (EEA and Switzerland only)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you reside in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, you may have the right to exercise additional rights available to you under applicable laws, including:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><strong>Right of erasure.</strong> You may have a broader right to erasure of personal data that we hold about you. For example, if it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was originally collected. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations, among other things.</li>
<li><strong>Right to object to processing.</strong> You may have the right to request that we stop processing your personal data or to stop sending you marketing communications.</li>
<li><strong>Right to restrict processing.</strong> You may have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. For example, where you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or unlawfully held.</li>
<li><strong>Right to data portability.</strong>&nbsp;In certain circumstances, you may have the right to be provided with your personal data in a structured, machine readable and commonly used format and to request that we transfer the personal data to another data controller without hindrance.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to exercise any of the above rights, please contact our support team or contact our Data Protection Officer (see our contact details in Section 17 below). We will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. To protect your privacy and security, we may take steps to verify your identity before complying with the request.</p>
<p>You may also have the right to make a GDPR complaint to the relevant Supervisory Authority. A list of Supervisory Authorities is available here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>. If you need further assistance regarding your rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable law. In some cases, our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process personal data for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.</p>

<h4>For EEA and Swiss Individuals: Privacy Shield Notice for Personal Data Transfers to the United States</h4>
<p>Jive complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Economic Area (“EEA”) member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Jive has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/ </a></p>
<p><strong>A) Definitions</strong></p>
<p>“Personal Data” means information that (1) is transferred from the EEA or Switzerland to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.</p>
<p>“Sensitive Personal Information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual’s health.</p>
<p><strong>B) Principles</strong></p>
<p>Jive may receive Personal Data from its own personnel as well as from its affiliates, resellers, customers, end-users and other parties located in the EEA or Switzerland.</p>
<p>Such information may contain, but is not limited to name (first and last name), position, address, email address, phone number, login credentials, human resources data and transaction information and may be about customers, clients of customers, business partners, acquisition targets, potential buyers consultants, employees, and candidates for employment and includes information recorded on various media as well as electronic data. In addition, we might collect location and traffic data. Please refer to our main <strong>Privacy Policy Statement</strong> (above) for more information regarding our data handling practices.</p>
<p>Jive is the controller of its own human resources data. In addition, Jive acting as a data processor or sub-processor may receive Personal Data via its customers. Jive executes data processing agreements with such customers which set out the parties’ obligations and responsibilities to comply with the Principles. Jive will cooperate with its customers to enable them to comply with the Principles.</p>
<p>Whenever Jive processes Personal Data, Jive complies with the Principles (as each Principle is applicable to Jive’s role):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Notice.</strong> Whenever we collect Personal Data directly from individuals, we shall inform an individual of the purpose for which we collect and use their Personal Data and the types of third parties to which Jive discloses or may disclose that Personal Data. Please refer to our main Privacy Policy Statement for more information regarding our data handling practices. Jive shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Data. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Data to Jive, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Jive uses or discloses the Personal Data for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected. Jive may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Choice.</strong> Whenever Jive collects Personal Data directly from individuals for marketing purposes, those individuals have the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Data is (1) to be disclosed to a third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual by contacting our Data Protection Officer via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@jivesoftware.com">privacy@jivesoftware.com</a>. For Sensitive Personal Information, Jive will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-Agent third party or for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Jive shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information. &nbsp;Agents, technology vendors and contractors of Jive or affiliated companies may have access to an individual’s Personal Data on a need to know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of Jive or providing or enabling elements of the services. All such agents, technology vendors and contractors who have access to such information are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for Jive or as otherwise required by law.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability for Onward Transfer.</strong> Whenever we collect Personal Data directly from individuals, prior to disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we shall notify the individual of such disclosure and allow the individual the choice (opt out) of such disclosure. Jive shall ensure that any third party to which Personal Data may be disclosed agrees in writing to provide the same level of privacy protection as set forth in this policy.Jive’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Jive remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Jive proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</li>
<li><strong>Data Security.</strong> We shall take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Jive has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, Jive cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data on or transmitted via the Internet.</li>
