<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
</div><div class="n"><p><strong>Jimdo Privacy Policy <br>
</strong></p>
<p><br>
At Jimdo we care about your privacy. In the following we describe what information is collected and how we deal with it. This policy applies to all of the Jimdo Products. Jimdo is a service of the NorthClick GmbH.<br>

For certain services, such as JimdoPro, we also ask you for your contact details (which we need for the domain registration since you will be the domain owner) and payment information (which we save in encrypted form on secure servers). The information you provide is stored as long as you are a Jimdo-User. Due to tax requirements some information of JimdoPro-Users has to be stored for seven years.<br>
