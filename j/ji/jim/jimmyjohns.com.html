<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">
<div class="detailContent">
<p>This Policy was last updated on March 25, 2019.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to: the websites located at jimmyjohns.com, online.jimmyjohns.com, store.jimmyjohns.com, mercury-gift.com/JimmyJohns,
Jimmy John's mobile applications, and any other websites or applications associated with the Jimmy John's brand or products that direct the viewer or user to
this Policy (collectively, "Platforms"). In this Policy, the terms "we," "our," and "us" refers to Jimmy John's Franchisor SPV, LLC ("Jimmy John's"). Jimmy
John's parent, subsidiary, and related companies are collectively referred to as affiliates ("Affiliates").
</p>
<p>
Jimmy John's is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information collected by or submitted to us through our Platforms. We believe it is important
for you to know how we treat the information you share with us. This Policy will explain how your personal information will be treated as you use our Platforms and
their features or place an order for products through our Platforms. Personal information includes any information you may provide to us, including your name,
address, telephone number, e-mail addresses or credit card information. This Policy is incorporated into, and part of, our
<a href="https://www.jimmyjohns.com/terms-and-conditions/"><u>Terms &amp; Conditions </u></a>, which govern your use of our Platforms in general.
</p>
<p>
Depending upon which of our services you are utilizing, the types of nonpublic personal information that we may collect include: (i) information we receive from you
on applications, forms, and in other communications to us, whether in writing, in person, by telephone, or any other means; (ii) information about your transactions
with us, our Affiliates, or others; and (iii) information we receive from a consumer reporting agency.
</p>
<p>
This Policy does not govern the manner in which we may use information that we have obtained from any other source, such as information obtained from a public record
or from another person or entity.
</p>
<p>
By visiting our Platforms, you acknowledge and agree that you have read this Policy and agree to the collection, use, and other processing of your information in accordance
with the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree to all of the terms, conditions, and practices set forth herein, do not access our Platforms or any of their
pages, do not place an order for products through our Platforms, or submit any personal or confidential information online.
</p>
<h3>How We Collect Your Information</h3>
<p>
Every time you visit us through one of our Platforms, our servers collect basic technical information. Generally, your e-mail address and all other personal information is
collected only when you voluntarily provide that data while registering on our Platforms or for activities such as placing an online order, participating in surveys, or
entering information on our Platforms. For example, we may collect your domain name, the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to Jimmy John's and
your browser and operating system. We do this using cookies, pixels, web beacons, and/or GIF files. "Cookies" are small text files that identify an individual computer's
browser entering a website or other information about a website user, and are stored on a user's hard drive. They allow the site to track that browser's movement through
the site over several sessions.
</p>
<p>
If you do not want a cookie placed on your computer as a result of using our Platforms, you may disable cookies altogether by modifying the Preferences section of your
Internet browser. If you reject the cookie, you may be unable to use portions of our Platforms that require registration, some pages on our Platforms might not function
properly, and the Platform experience will not be capable of being tailored to you from visit to visit. If you have no problem accepting cookies, but wish to be informed
of their use, you may turn on a warning prompt by modifying the cookie warning section also located in the Preferences section of your Internet browser. Please consult
your web browser's Help documentation for more information about how to turn cookies on and off for your browser. Cookies are placed on your computer, and, accordingly,
we do not store cookies on our computers, but may forward them to external parties.
</p>
<p>
In addition, our Platforms use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to help our Platforms analyze
how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our Platforms (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on
servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our Platforms, compiling reports on website activity for website
operators, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do
so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may
refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, or by enabling the Do Not Track settings in your browser, however, please note that if
you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our Platforms. By using our Platforms, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the
manner and for the purposes set out above.
</p>

offers, and solicitations that may take the form of U.S. mail, telephone calls, e-mail, social media, and other methods of contact; and for internal analysis in order to improve our products
and services. We may share your e-mail address or mailing address with our Affiliates and service providers for these purposes (for more information please see the section

its rules, and may share this information with our Affiliates and service providers (for more information please see the section entitled <strong>Sharing Information</strong> below).
</p>
<h3>Survey</h3>

parental consent for the minor's use of our Platforms. Parents should supervise the online activities of their children, and consider the use of tools available from online services
and software providers that help provide kid-friendly Internet environments.
</p>
<p>
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, and we do not specifically market to, children under the age of 13 years old. If you are under the age of thirteen,

identifiable information without your consent, except to the extent required by law, in accordance with your instructions, or as set out below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Transaction Requirements:</strong> We sometimes retain the services of third parties to perform functions or services on our behalf. We will require that these companies

<li>
<strong>Affiliated Companies:</strong> We may also provide all of the types of nonpublic personal information listed above to one or more of our Affiliates and service providers.
Such service providers include, without limitation, financial entities, insurers, vendors, and/or companies involved in the food services business. Furthermore, we may also
provide all the information that we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, on behalf of our Affiliates, or to other institutions
with whom we or our Affiliates have joint marketing agreements.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Joint Promotions:</strong> From time to time, we may join with third parties to provide specific services or products. When users sign up for these services or order
these products, we will share only the names and other information that is necessary for the third parties to provide these services or products. These third parties are not
permitted to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services or products. However, we do not undertake to confirm, investigate, or
police their practices.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Protection of Site and Others:</strong> We may preserve, and have the right to disclose, any information about you or your use of our Platforms without your prior

Platforms, or the public; and/or (ii) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties. We also may disclose information as we deem necessary to: (1)
satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (2) pursue available remedies or limit damages we may sustain; and (3) enforce our

that Jimmy John's goes through a business transition, such as a merger, another company acquires Jimmy John's or its Affiliates, or Jimmy John's sells a portion of its assets, your
personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If as a result of the business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in
a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be given the choice to opt out.
