<p>Jiffy Lube<sup>®</sup> International, Inc. is a Delaware corporation whose principal business offices are located at 700 Milam Street, Houston, Texas 77002.</p>
<p></p><div class="mainContentBold">Jiffy Lube<sup>®</sup> International, Inc. Privacy Principles</div>
<em>(last updated 23 October, 2001)</em><p></p>
<p></p><div class="mainContentBold">Overview</div><p></p>
<p>Jiffy Lube<sup>®</sup> International, Inc. ("JLI") is committed to protecting our customers' and consumers' privacy. JLI's Privacy Principles guide our conduct in the collection and use of all personal information needed to understand and meet our customers' and consumers' needs. We encourage you to read this document. We provide links to third party web sites whose privacy policies we do not control. We also encourage you to review the privacy policies on these linked sites and all web sites you visit.</p>
<p>JLI business units implement specific privacy rules and practices, consistent with these principles, to ensure that good privacy management practices are employed company-wide. We require that our business partners, vendors, and suppliers also embrace these rules and practices whenever they manage personal information on our behalf. We respect and adhere to privacy laws and regulations in the countries where we do business and support industry self-regulation as an effective means for keeping pace with the latest developments in technology.</p>
<p></p><div class="mainContentBold">Collecting and using personal information</div><p></p> 
<p>JLI collects and uses personal information in order to provide quality products, services, and information to our customers and consumers. We collect demographic information such as age and gender, lifestyle information such as personal interests, and other relevant information such as product usage and preferences in order to provide tailored or in some cases customized products, services, information, and/or offers that will provide the greatest benefit to our customers and consumers. For example, we may ask for a consumer's address and product preferences so that we may send samples of a product that closely fits individual needs. Or, we may ask a parent to provide us with his or her e-mail address and childrens' ages so that we may provide a newsletter packed with parenting tips for car travel with children at the exact ages of the family members. Contact information may be gathered so that we can respond to a consumer's question or request. We limit the collection of personal information to what we need to know in order to achieve our goal of providing products and services that enhance the car and the driving experience.</p>
<p>While our consumers volunteer to us most of the information we store in our databases, that information is augmented by purchased data in some situations. This information is made available to us by companies that aggregate data from publicly available sources, such as telephone directories and public records.</p>
<p>In addition to the many brand names they know and trust, we also deliver superior value by providing tailored, relevant information, products, services and offers to our customers and consumers. Examples of the products and services we may provide to consumers include: 
</p><ul>
<li>Newsletters that provide important information and useful advice</li>
<li>Answers to car care questions and requests</li>
<li>New product announcements</li>
<li>Contests and sweepstakes</li>
<li>Free sample offers</li>
<li>Online product ordering</li>
<li>Personalized subscription services, such as reminders to service their automobiles</li>
<li>Membership in an interest community, such as a club for owners of high-mileage vehicles</li>
</ul>
These, and other customized offerings designed to meet the individual needs of each consumer, may include requests for personal information. We learn about our consumers' special or individual needs by collecting information from and about our consumers. We often survey consumers to ask their product preferences without collecting any personally identifiable information about them. The survey responses are aggregated to provide an overall picture of consumer preferences, and personal information is not needed for us to provide increasing benefits to consumers.<p></p> 
<p>JLI informs consumers about the information we collect, how we use it, whether it will be transferred to third parties to provide the products or services requested, and how to contact JLI with privacy inquiries. Where possible, we provide consumers with details prior to their providing information. In other situations, we provide consumers with this information the first time we re-contact them for a different purpose than the one for which it was provided.</p>
<p></p><div class="mainContentBold">Sharing information</div><p></p>
<p>We may share the personal information consumers provide to us with other companies we have hired to provide services for us. For example, we often hire companies to mail consumers oil change reminders, mail samples or send newsletters for us. We engage in business relationships with companies that we believe operate in a highly ethical and professional manner. These companies are contractually bound to use personal information shared with them only to deliver the services we have hired them to provide. We do not otherwise share personal information without the consumer's consent unless required by law or the consumer has granted us permission to do so.</p>
<p></p><div class="mainContentBold">Controlling, accessing and updating your personal information</div><p></p>
<p>Our consumers voluntarily provide us with most of the personal information we collect. Whenever possible, we notify consumers that the data they are providing will be stored in our databases for future use, prior to their making a decision to provide information. This allows consumers to decide whether or not they agree to have their information stored in our databases in exchange for the product or service they desire. Of course, not providing us with their personal information may prevent them from receiving the full benefit of our personalized or tailored offerings, but we fully respect this choice and make our best efforts to still deliver the best products and services that circumstances allow.</p>
<p>Consumers always have the option to ask us not to use their information or to remove it from our mailing lists. Consumers who wish to have their information updated, corrected or suppressed, or who wish to opt-out from our mailing lists, may contact JLI at the address given at the end of this document. Consumers should provide us with their names, addresses, other relevant contact information (phone number, E-mail address), and the name of the brands and programs they wish to be removed from. JLI will use reasonable efforts to comply with such requests as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We may collect information via technologies. For example, the use of cookies is implemented on some of our web sites. Cookies are small files that web sites place on your computer to identify it and provide a better visitor experience. You can disable cookies in your browser and still access our web sites. However, disabling cookies may cause some web site functions, such as a shopping cart for online purchase, to not operate properly and will limit your use of some services.</p>
<p>We anticipate that technology advancements will soon give consumers a broader and more comprehensive range of privacy options while also allowing us to collect information about our products and services. When these advancements are implemented on our web sites, we will inform our consumers about these technologies, the information that they may gather, and the benefits they provide so that our consumers understand and make knowledgeable decisions to manage their use.</p>
<p></p><div class="mainContentBold">Data quality and access</div><p></p>
<p>In order to best serve our customers and consumers, we may transfer personal information to JLI databases located in countries other than the one in which it was provided. Our policy is to ensure that personal information is provided the same level of protection, no matter where it is stored.</p>
<p>JLI provides consumers with reasonable access to the personal information they have provided us so that they can review and correct it, or ask us not to use it. JLI takes necessary steps to ensure consumers' personal information is accurate, complete, and current.</p>
<p>Accurate information is essential to our ability to provide useful and targeted products, offers, and services. Consumers wishing to access personal information that they have provided to us, or request that information about them be corrected or updated, may submit their request to the JLI address listed at the end of this document.</p>
<p>When contacting us, consumers should provide us with their name, address, and other relevant contact information (phone number, e-mail address). JLI reserves the right to request a username, password, and/or additional information so that we can be sure personal information is available only to the person who provided it. We will use reasonable efforts to respond to data access requests as soon as possible.</p>
<p>JLI plans to use applicable suppression list services available from direct marketing associations in countries where they exist. These organizations maintain "do not contact" lists consisting of the names of people who have specified that they do not want to receive unsolicited marketing materials. It is not in the best interests of either JLIC or our consumers to send unsolicited marketing materials to people who do not want them, and therefore we view the use of suppression list services as an essential part of our direct marketing programs.</p>
<p></p><div class="mainContentBold">Your Children's Personal Information</div><p></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have received personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. JLI encourages parents to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:
</p><ul>
<li>Teach children never to give personal information such as their name, address, phone number or school, to anyone unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.</li>
<li>Know the Internet sites your child is visiting and which sites are appropriate. Many software packages are available to help parents identify and keep their children away from objectionable or unsafe sites.</li>
<li>Look for Web site privacy policies at each Web site you and/or your child visits. Know how your child's information is treated.</li>
</ul>
<div class="mainContentBold">Security</div><p></p>
<p>JLI takes the utmost care of personal information given to us by consumers. We store personal information in password-controlled servers with limited access. We protect this information to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or inadvertent destruction. Individuals who have been granted access to personal information are aware of their responsibility to protect the security and confidentiality of that information, and have been provided with training or instructions on how to do so. Sensitive personal information, such as a credit card number, is transmitted over the Internet using encryption.</p>
<p>For your protection we recommend that you never provide your JLI account information, username, or password to anyone. Do not select a password that is easy for another person to guess, for example the name of your child or a favorite hobby. If your password should become exposed to another person, we recommend you change it immediately. If you become aware of any suspicious activity relating to your JLI account information, please contact us immediately so that we may investigate.</p>
<div class="mainContentBold">Accountability</div><p></p>
<p>JLI holds its employees, business partners, suppliers and vendors accountable for maintaining the trust our consumers place in us. We provide privacy training and information to our employees, and periodically audit our compliance with our Privacy Principles. Improper handling of personal information is viewed as a serious breach of conduct and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.</p>
<p>We periodically audit our privacy program as a means to measure compliance with our own privacy principles and processes. Audits are conducted by individual business organizations and by our internal controls organization, and results are reported to JLI senior management.</p>
<p>JLI supports industry self-regulation as an effective means for protecting the privacy of each individual. JLI seeks to join with effective self-regulatory programs and adhere to their dispute resolution processes.</p>
<p>JLI respects all privacy laws and regulations in the countries where we do business. We seek to work cooperatively with local governments to establish the most effective mechanisms available to protect the privacy of their citizens.</p>
<div class="mainContentBold">Changes to these Principles</div><p></p>
<p>JLI will occasionally update these principles. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date on this page. For material changes to the Privacy Principles, JLI will notify you by placing prominent notice on the web site.</p>
