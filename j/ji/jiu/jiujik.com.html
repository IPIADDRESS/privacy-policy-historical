          <p><b>2. JiuJik.com Web site Use Information</b></p>
          <p><b>Cookies</b></p>

          <p>Statistical Analysis and Banner Advertising</p>
          <p>We may perform statistical analyses of user behaviour in order to measure interest in the various areas of the JiuJik.com Web site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We also use demographic and preference information to allow advertising banners on the JiuJik.com Web site to be targeted, in aggregate, to the readers for whom they are most relevant. This means that readers see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the advertisement. For these purposes, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.</p>

          <p><b>What Are Cookies?</b></p>
          <p>Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site.  They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive.  Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages.  This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet.  Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.</p>

          <p><b>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</b></p>
