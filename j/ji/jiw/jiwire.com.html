<p class="standard_paragraph"><strong><a name="1"></a>1.	What personally identifiable information does JiWire collect?</strong></p>
<p>The type of information we collect depends on type of service or product we are providing to you.</p>
<p><u>When you register to use www.JiWire.com:</u>  JiWire owns and operates the web site www.JiWire.com.  JiWire's primary goal in collecting personal information is to maximize your online experience when using our site.  When you register as a member, you must provide your, e-mail address, country, and ZIP or postal code, along with information about the industry in which you work, your job function, your company size, and your household income. Once you register with JiWire.com you are no longer anonymous to us. At registration, you have the option to also provide other information to us, such as whether you wish to receive newsletters or special offers.  The information we collect allows us to enable each user to personalize the use of our services and to continually improve our services.  Some services are limited to authorized users, so we require this information to identify each user and to enable us to provide secure services that address the needs and preferences of specific users.</p>
<p><u>When you register for a Registration Key to install software:</u>  When you download, install and use JiWire software, you are entering into a contractual relationship with JiWire according to the terms of the license agreement that is presented to you in the installation process.  When you register for the Registration Key to install software, JiWire collects information including your e-mail address, country, and ZIP or postal code, along with information about the industry in which you work, your job function, your company size, and your household income.  Our membership features include the ability to save information on hotspot locations, addresses, features, and reviews, so we collect personally identifiable information to allow us to provide a customizable user experience for you.</p>
<br>
<p class="standard_paragraph"><strong><a name="2"></a>2.	What anonymous information does JiWire collect?</strong></p>
<p><u>Web-log data</u></p>
<p>Your Internet browser has a feature called "cookies" which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to our site. Like many web sites, we use cookies to collect certain types of information when you visit our web site.  However, cookies tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit JiWire.com, but certain personalized features will not be available to you if you disable or delete cookies created during your visits. You may elect not to allow cookies to be collected by selecting certain options on your browser.</p>
<p>JiWire also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you requested.</p>
<p>We may use tracking technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li> keeping count of return visits to our site
    </li><li> accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on our site and advertisement usage
    </li><li> determining which features users like best
    </li><li> saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site
    </li><li> displaying advertising targeted to your interests and usage of our site
</li></ul>
<p><u>Statistical Data</u></p>
<p>JiWire may collect certain statistical data that does not identify you.  You will be prompted each time we ask for this information, and you will have the option to provide it or not.  We aggregate this information and use it for the same types of purposes as we use web-log data.</p>
<br>
<p class="standard_paragraph"><strong><a name="3"></a>3.	Why does JiWire collect personal information, and how does JiWire use the information?</strong></p>
<p><u>When you register to use www.JiWire.com:</u>  JiWire uses the information we gather to enhance your user experience on our site. We may use tracking information to determine how much interest a page generates overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages. This helps us continue to better understand our users and their needs. We may also use the information to customize content and advertisement for our users and to help us deliver products and services, such as our email newsletters. Additionally, we may use the information to send you information from our partners on topics that interest you.</p>
<p><u>When you register for a Registration Key to install software:</u>  JiWire collects personally identifiable information in order to provide you updates and revisions to the software and to facilitate any notices between JiWire and you required by the license agreement.</p>
<br>
<p class="standard_paragraph"><strong><a name="4"></a>4.	What choices do you have to limit use or disclosure of personally identifiable information?</strong></p>
<p>Users who would rather not provide any of the user data requested by our registration process do not need to register with us. You can view some of the content and use some of the services offered by our site without registering, but that will limit your ability to access certain features on our site and prevent you from obtaining a Registration Key.  We obtain your consent before sharing your information with others.  When you request a product or service, you are consenting for us to share with our partners only the information necessary to fulfill your request.  For example, if you use one of our co-branded sites or services, then you are consenting for us to share your personally identifiable information with our co-brand partner so that we can each provide you with the services related to that site.  We will ensure that any partner that assists us in fulfilling your requests agrees to protect your personally identifiable information in a manner that is consistent with the manner in which JiWire protects your personally identifiable information.</p>
<br>
<p class="standard_paragraph"><strong><a name="5"></a>5.	Will JiWire share your information?</strong></p>
<p>JiWire is not in the business of selling your personally identifiable information to third parties.  However, there are certain circumstances under which we may share personally identifiable information with our partners or other third parties.  Those circumstances are:</p>
<p>(a)	If you choose to allow us to share your information with third parties.</p>
<p>(b)	When we are working with other companies to provide you with information, products or services that you have requested.   They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but must first agree to safeguard your information and not to use it for other purposes.</p>
<p>(c)	When JiWire reasonably believes that your personally identifiable information should be shared in connection with a subpoena, court order or other legal process, or if your actions violate the law, our site's Terms of Use, a license agreement or threaten the rights or safety of JiWire or any other person.</p>
<p>(d)	If you use services co-branded by JiWire and one of JiWire's business partners, you grant us permission to send your personally identifiable information to such business partner. Our business partners' use of such information is governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information with anyone for any legal purpose, including without limitation with advertisers, investors and in the course of making presentations.</p>
<br>
<p class="standard_paragraph"><strong><a name="6"></a>6.	What about advertisements?</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers on our web site are allowed to gather information using cookies and other tracking technologies as set forth above. Except as specifically set forth in this privacy notice, JiWire does not share your personally identifiable information with advertisers. Advertisers on JiWire.com cannot identify you personally unless you register with them or specifically provide such information. If you submit personally identifiable information directly to one of our advertisers, the use, disclosure and protection of your information will be according to that advertiser's privacy policy.  You should read each advertiser's privacy notice prior to submitting any personally identifiable information to that advertiser.</p>
<br>
<p class="standard_paragraph"><strong><a name="7"></a>7.	What if you want to access your information?</strong></p>
<p>You may,</p>
<p>a.	<i>Request a copy of your personal information that we have collected by</i> <a href="http://www.jiwire.com/corp-contact-us.htm">contacting JiWire</a>.</p>
<p>b.	<i>Request that your personal information be corrected or updated.</i>  If you registered to use our web site, you may update your user profile at www.JiWire.com (help with this process is available by <a href="http://www.jiwire.com/corp-contact-us.htm">contacting JiWire</a>).  If you desire to correct or update the information you provided to us when you registered for a Registration Key, then when you sign in, on the "MY JIWIRE / MEMBER DASHBOARD" page, under "Account Profile", click on the "Change My Profile" button, which will allow you to review and change your profile information.</p>
<p>c.	<i>Request that we delete your personal information.</i>  If you wish for us to delete your personally identifiable information, send a request through our <a href="http://www.jiwire.com/corp-contact-us.htm">contact form</a>.  We will remove your personally identifiable information from our files, except to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a legitimate business purpose (such as billing or complying with laws or regulations).  If you request that we delete your personal information, you may experience some degraded performance on our site.  If you request that we delete information your provided when you registered for a Registration Key, the license agreement between you and JiWire for the use of the applicable software will terminate and you must delete the software from your computer.</p>
<p>We want for our information about you to be accurate, complete, and current.  Therefore, we encourage you to monitor your information on our site and to correct and update it as necessary.</p>
<br>

<p class="standard_paragraph"><strong><a name="8"></a>8.	How does JiWire protect your information?</strong></p>
<p>The first step in protecting your information is ensuring that this privacy policy is fully implemented and enforced.  JiWire has a Privacy Director who is responsible for ensuring our compliance with this policy and the integrity of our internal controls.</p>
<p>When you submit sensitive information to JiWire, we protect the transfer with industry standard encryption technology.  Your information is then stored in secured environment and accessible only by authorized personnel.  We will take reasonable precautions to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>
<p>JiWire is not liable for loss of passwords due to user carelessness.  If you lose control over your password, you may lose control over your personally identifiable information on our site.  Therefore, if you believe that your password has been compromised, we recommend that you immediately change your password.  For information on how to do this, please see Section 7 (What if you want to access your information?)</p>
<br>
<p class="standard_paragraph"><strong><a name="9"></a>9.	How will you know if the privacy policy changes?</strong></p>
<p>Our business changes over time, and our privacy practices may be modified as our business changes.  Any modifications to our privacy practices will be reflected first in this notice of our Privacy Policy, so you should check our site frequently to watch for changes. If there is a material change in our privacy practices, we will indicate on our site that our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the new privacy notice. If we are going to be using the information collected from users in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify affected users of the change via email.</p>
<br>
<p class="standard_paragraph"><strong><a name="10"></a>10.	What if you have a question or concern about your information?</strong></p>
<p>If you have a question or concern about the collection, use, or access to your information, about this privacy notice, or about any other aspects of JiWire.com, please contact us through our <a href="http://www.jiwire.com/corp-contact-us.htm">contact form</a>.  Provide us with a thorough description of your question or concern and we will attempt to answer or resolve it.  If our customer service department does not satisfy your concern, we will escalate your concern to appropriate management within JiWire.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that we cannot adequately address your concern, you and JiWire will attempt in good faith to resolve any bona fide dispute relating in any way to our collection, use, or handling of your personal information by confidential mediation under the CPR Mediation Procedure.  Mediation of the dispute will be conducted on an agreed date by a single, agreed upon, independent mediator in San Francisco, California, or another agreed location.  Any bona fide dispute not resolved within a reasonable period of time by discussion or mediation will be finally resolved by confidential arbitration in accordance with the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration by a sole arbitrator in San Francisco, California, or another agreed location.  For more information about dispute resolution, see the procedures set forth in our <a href="terms-of-service.htm">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
