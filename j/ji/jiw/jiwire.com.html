When you request a product or service, you are consenting for us to share with our partners only the information necessary to fulfill your request.  For example, if you use one of our co-branded sites or services, then you are consenting for us to share your personally identifiable information with our co-brand partner so that we can each provide you with the services related to that site.  We will ensure that any partner that assists us in fulfilling your requests agrees to protect your personally identifiable information in a manner that is consistent with the manner in which JiWire protects your personally identifiable information.</p>
	<p><strong><a name="5"></a>5.	Will JiWire share your information?</strong></p>
	<p>JiWire is not in the business of selling your personally identifiable information to third parties.  However, there are certain circumstances under which we may share personally identifiable information with our partners or other third parties.  Those circumstances are:</p>
	<p>(a)	If you choose to allow us to share your information with third parties.</p>
	<p>(b)	When we are working with other companies to provide you with information, products or services that you have requested.   They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but must first agree to safeguard your information and not to use it for other purposes.</p>
	<p>(c)	When JiWire reasonably believes that your personally identifiable information should be shared in connection with a subpoena, court order or other legal process, or if your actions violate the law, our site's Terms of Use, a license agreement or threaten the rights or safety of JiWire or any other person.</p>
	<p>(d)	If you use services co-branded by JiWire and one of JiWire's business partners, you grant us permission to send your personally identifiable information to such business partner. Our business partners' use of such information is governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>
	<p>Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information with anyone for any legal purpose, including without limitation with advertisers, investors and in the course of making presentations.</p>
	<p><strong><a name="6"></a>6.	What about advertisements?</strong></p>
	<p>Advertisers on our web site are allowed to gather information using cookies and other tracking technologies as set forth above. Except as specifically set forth in this privacy notice, JiWire does not share your personally identifiable information with advertisers. Advertisers on JiWire.com cannot identify you personally unless you register with them or specifically provide such information. If you submit personally identifiable information directly to one of our advertisers, the use, disclosure and protection of your information will be according to that advertiser's privacy policy.  You should read each advertiser's privacy notice prior to submitting any personally identifiable information to that advertiser.</p>
	<p><strong><a name="7"></a>7.	What if you want to access your information?</strong></p>

We will remove your personally identifiable information from our files, except to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a legitimate business purpose (such as billing or complying with laws or regulations).  If you request that we delete your personal information, you may experience some degraded performance on our site.  If you request that we delete information your provided when you registered for a Registration Key, the license agreement between you and JiWire for the use of the applicable software will terminate and you must delete the software from your computer.</p>

	<p><strong><a name="9"></a>9.	How will you know if the privacy policy changes?</strong></p>
	<p>Our business changes over time, and our privacy practices may be modified as our business changes.  Any modifications to our privacy practices will be reflected first in this notice of our Privacy Policy, so you should check our site frequently to watch for changes. If there is a material change in our privacy practices, we will indicate on our site that our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the new privacy notice.

Mediation of the dispute will be conducted on an agreed date by a single, agreed upon, independent mediator in San Francisco, California, or another agreed location.
