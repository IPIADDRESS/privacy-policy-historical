<h2>

<br>
1.
To satisfy any laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act,
regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such information;
<br>
2.
To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring
legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms &amp;
Conditions or other user policies;
<br>
3.

<br>
4.

specifically reserve the right to disclose any and all information to law
enforcement in the event that a crime is committed, is suspected, or if we

discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request
of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process.

information is solely your decision.
<h2>IX. Our Commitment to Data Security.</h2>
We take measures to protect the transmission of all sensitive end-user information.
We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems.
Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-
party 'hackers' from illegally obtaining this information. We take all reasonable
measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-

assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite our reasonable
security measures.
