        <h2>Jigsaw Member Privacy Policy</h2>
          <!-- Start of text -->

Effective date August 13, 2004
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Introduction
</div>
<br>
This privacy policy covers how, when and why we collect, use and share information about our users.  
Please read this policy carefully and review it often because it may change.  
This policy does not apply to our collection and use of data about companies and contacts contained in our 
database system.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Overview
</div>
<br>
<ul> 
<li>Protecting the privacy and anonymity of our members is important to us.  
All members must select a unique screen name that is their public identity on the system.  
Members should be careful not to include personally identifiable information in their screen name.</li>
<li>Members must complete a registration process.  We will collect personally identifiable information 
from our members during registration.  We do not automatically included any registration information into 
our business contact database.</li> 
<li>We collect, compile and may display historical, statistical and aggregate information about our 
members' use of our system by their screen name.  We also use automatic means like cookies, clear gifs 
and log files to collect user information that may be tied to personally identifiable information.</li> 
<li>We do not use or share personally identifiable information other than as described in this privacy 
statement.  We will provide personally identifiable information to our agents and service providers so 
that we may provide our services. We may also disclose such information as required by law or to protect 
our interests or the rights of third parties.</li>
<li>Aggregate information that is gathered up across all member accounts is not shared together with 
personally identifiable information.</li>  
<li>We communicate with our members by email.  We do not give or sell email addresses to anyone for 
their marketing purposes.</li>
<li>Members have access to their information through the 'My Account' area of our system and may set 
or choose their sharing, use and communication preferences.</li>
<li>We secure information we collect using generally accepted industry standards.</li>
<li>This privacy statement may change at any time and changes take effect when posted unless otherwise 
indicated.</li>
<li>We will cooperate with legal inquiries and requests made by third parties to enforce laws or to 
protect their rights.  Although members are anonymous while using our system, the improper or illegal 
use of our system can jeopardize that anonymity.</li>
</ul>  
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Notice about Children
</div>
<br>
Our system is directed to adult business people.  Children under the age of 18 are not permitted to 
use our system.  We do not knowingly collect information from or about children.  
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Screen Names
</div>
<br>
Maintaining the anonymity of our members is important to us.  During registration, members must 
request a unique screen name that will be publicly attributed (tied) to their use of our system.  
Screen names are the key to keeping our members anonymous.  We do not share screen names together 
with personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Collection of Registration Information
</div>
<br>
All users of our system must complete a registration process.  We will collect personally identifiable 
information during this process that includes name, email address and other personal contact information 
as indicated.  Registration information is kept private and secure.  We use this information to process 
registrations, maintain subscription accounts, contact our users and to provide our services.  We do 
not share registration information together with personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Adding Oneself to the Business Contact Database
</div>
<br>
Member registration information IS NOT automatically entered into our business contact database.  
Members can choose to enter their own business contact information by separately inputting that 
data after their account is activated.  All members may also be included in the system if entered 
by another member.  However, Jigsaw WILL NOT systematically include registration information in 
the database unless directed by the registering member.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Payment Information
</div>
<br>
To open a subscription account, members must enter valid credit card and/or other payment 
information needed to process their subscription payments.  We use this information for 
identification and verification purposes and to process payments.  We may also use this information 
to contact members about payment processing.  When members provide payment information, it is 
protected using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  We do not share credit card or payment 
information other than to process payments.  
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Referrals and referral totals
</div>
<br>
Members are encouraged to refer new users.  A new user may enter the registered email address of a 
referring member during registration.  We will use email addresses to complete the referral and 
award referral points.  The system will calculate and display the total number of referrals credited 
to each member, but the screen names of referred members are not displayed to protect their anonymity.  
We do not share referral information together with personally identifiable information. 
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Optional Personal Profile
</div>
<br>
Members may choose to complete an optional personal profile.  Completion of a personal profile is 
totally voluntary.  We will use this information to customize and personalize the services we provide.
We do not share personal profile information together with personally identifiable information. 
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Surveys or Contests
</div>
<br>
We may provide members the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys from time to time. 
Participation in contests or surveys is completely voluntary.  If members choose to participate, 
we may request certain additional personally identifiable information. We will use this 
information to monitor system traffic, supplement, amend and personalize our system, direct 
advertisements, and communicate with participants.  We will use email addresses to distribute 
and collect surveys, notify contest winners and award prizes.  We do not share information members 
provide through a contest or survey together with personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Collection of System Use Information
</div>
<br>
We use screen names to compile and process historical and statistical information about how and 
when our members use the system.  Historical and statistical information includes information about 
selected actions that our members take while on the system.  We will also aggregate (gather up across 
all member accounts) and store historical and statistical information. 
<br><br>
System use information is collected, surveyed, evaluated and scored by the system to 
assess the quality of data.  Member actions are effectively confirmed or challenged by the later 
actions of other members.  We use this evaluation process to maintain our collaborative, 
self-correcting system and to promote the development of the most accurate, complete and up-to-date 
data possible.  Members are objectively rated by the system based upon their actions.  
<br><br>
Our system uses points as an incentive and a point balance will be maintained for each member 
based upon system use information.  We may also use this information to add, adjust or discontinue 
certain services or functionality and to enforce our policies and procedures.
<br><br>
Compiled system use information, member ratings and point balances may be displayed online and 
shared along with screen names.  We do not share such information together with personally 
identifiable information.  System use information may be stored indefinitely, but may also 
be deleted at our discretion.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Collection of Information Automatically
</div>
<br>
We store information that we collect automatically through cookies, clear gifs and/or 
log files.  We use this information to create a profile of our members' preferences.  We tie 
personally identifiable information and system use information to member profiles in order to 
provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content and functionality 
of the site.  We do not share member profiles together with personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Cookies
</div>
<br>
We use cookies on our system.  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer 
for record-keeping purposes. We link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable 
information users submit while they are on the system. 
<br><br>
We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier 
for users to navigate our system.  A session ID cookie expires when a user closes their browser.  
A persistent cookie remains on a user's hard drive for an extended period of time.  Users can 
remove persistent cookies by following directions provided by their Internet browser.  We use 
persistent cookies to store members' email addresses, so they do not have to enter it more than 
once.  Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to 
enhance the experience and functionality on our site.  
<br><br>
If users reject cookies, they may still use our system, but their ability to use some areas of 
our site may be limited.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons)
</div>
<br>
We use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons), that help us better manage 
content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with 
a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of 
web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs 
are embedded invisibly on web pages. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to personally 
identifiable information users submit while they are on the system. 
<br><br>
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our 
marketing campaigns.  
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Log Files
</div>
<br>
We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information 
includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), 
referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  
<br><br>
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to 
administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic 
information about our user base as a whole. We link this automatically-collected data to 
personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Sharing Aggregate Information
</div>
<br>
We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) demographic, statistical, historical 
and other similar information about our users and members and their use of our system.  
Aggregate information is not shared together with personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Sharing Personally Identifiable Information
</div>
<br>
We do not share personally identifiable information about our members except as follows:
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Agents
</div>
<br>
We use an outside company (Verisign) to process subscription payments.  This processing 
company does not retain, share, store or use member payment information for any other purposes.  
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Service Providers
</div>
<br>
We use third parties service providers for network, security, email and hosting services 
for our system.  We may use third party service providers to conduct surveys or contests.  
We will only provide member information that is necessary for third parties to provide 
their respective services to us.  These third parties are prohibited from using personally 
identifiable information for any other purposes.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Legal Disclaimer
</div>
<br>
Even though members are anonymous while using our system, the improper or illegal use of our 
system may jeopardize that anonymity.  We reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable 
information about our members, as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary 
to protect our rights or interests, the rights or interests of others and/or to comply with a 
judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Communicating with our Members
</div>
<br>
We will typically communicate with our members using their registered email address.  
We do not share or sell email addresses to anyone for their marketing purposes.  
If we cannot reach our members by email, we may use other contact information such as 
their address or telephone number.  We will communicate with members in accordance with 
their preferences and in response to inquiries, to provide requested services and to 
manage their accounts. 
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Service-related Announcements and Notifications
</div>
<br>
We will send members mandatory service-related announcements and notifications by email 
when necessary.  Members cannot opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional 
in nature.  If members do not wish to receive them, they have the option of canceling their 
account.  We may broadcast important messages to all users or send individual messages to 
specific members.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Newsletters
</div>
<br>
Members may choose to receive our voluntary email newsletters and may subscribe and unsubscribe 
at any time.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Other Communications
</div>
<br>
We may send information to members by email about our services, including special alerts, offers, 
awards, surveys, contests, promotions and updates.  Members will be given the option not to 
receive these types of communications.  
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Access to Information
</div>
<br>
Members may access and change their registration information using the 'My Account' area 
provided by the system.  Members may change their password, screen name, email address, 
other contact information, payment information, optional personal profile, and their 
sharing, use and communication preferences.  Members may access other information collected 
and processed about them by using standard system functionality.   To access any other member 
related information, if any, members may email us at 
<a href="mailto:privacy@jigsaw.com">privacy@jigsaw.com</a>.  
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Choosing Preferences (Opt-in/Opt-out)
</div>
<br>
Members may opt-in or opt-out of having their personally identifiable information shared or 
used for certain purposes.  Whenever the possibility exists that information collected about 
our members could be shared or used for certain purposes, members will be given the choice of 
whether or not to participate.  We will provide the opportunity for members to make that choice 
when we ask for or share the information with third parties. 
<br><br>
Members may also change sharing, use and communication preferences at any time using the 'My Account' 
area provided by the system.  Recipients of our newsletter and other promotional communications from 
us may also opt-out of receiving that information by following the instructions included in any such 
communication.  
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
Information Security
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Generally accepted standards
</div>
<br>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect all information collected by us.  
We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect information against loss, theft and 
unauthorized access or disclosure during transmission and once we receive it.  Perfect 
security does not exist on the Internet and no method of transmission or electronic 
storage is completely secure.  While we work hard to use commercially acceptable means to 
protect the information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 
<br><br>
<b><i>Passwords</i></b>
<br><br>
During registration, members must select a password.  Passwords are used to secure member 
information and the integrity of the system.  We only store a one-way encryption of member 
passwords which means passwords cannot be unencrypted by us.  Our login page provides a way 
for members to obtain access to the system in case they lose or forget their password.  
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
General Information
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Business Transitions
</div>
<br>
In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another 
company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, member information will likely be among 
the assets transferred to a third party.  The third party would then have the right to continue 
using such information as set forth in this policy.  Members will be notified via email and 
prominent notice on our site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of member 
information.  
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Links to Other Sites
</div>
<br>
Our system contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us.  We are not 
responsible for the privacy practices of those other sites.  This privacy statement applies only 
to information collected by us through our system.  You should keep aware of when you leave our 
site and read the privacy statements of each and every other web site that collects your personally 
identifiable information.  
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Changes to this Privacy Policy
</div>
<br>
We reserve the right to change this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  
This policy was last updated on: June 9, 2004.  We will post changes to this statement, our homepage, 
and other places that we deem appropriate so our members are aware of what information we collect, 
how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  Changes shall automatically 
be effective when posted unless otherwise indicated.  If we make material changes to this policy, 
we may notify members by email or by other prominent means online.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">
Legal Requests
</div><br>
We will cooperate with law enforcement inquiries.  In response to a verified request by law 
enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged 
illegal activity, we may disclose member information, including personally identifiable 
information, without a subpoena.   
<br><br>
Except as otherwise described herein, we will not disclose member information, including 
personally identifiable information, without a subpoena, court order or substantially 
similar legal process or procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure 
of such information is necessary to report suspected illegal or improper activity, protect 
our rights or interests, protect our members' rights or interests, protect the rights or 
interests of third parties, or enforce our policies and procedures.
