        How is it used?</b></p>
      <p>Your personal information. At jcpenneyportraits.com, we only collect 
        personally identifiable information about you to the extent you specifically 
        provide it to us. This includes, for example, the information you provide 
        when you place an order, register for a service, respond to a survey or 
        enter a contest or sweepstakes online. We may also receive information 
        from other companies. We use this information you share with us</p>
      <ul>
        <li>to provide the products or services or benefits you request,</li>
        <li>to develop and improve our products and services,</li>
        <li>to improve the content of our site and its usefulness to 
          you, and</li>
        <li>for marketing and promotional purposes.<br></li></ul>
          <p>
          We may share this information among JCPenney Company, Inc., Lifetouch 
          Inc. and their affiliated companies (the "Affiliated Companies") 
          and you may receive product and service information from any of them. 
          In addition, we may share this information with third parties that we 
          believe are reputable in order to offer products and services that may 
          be of interest to you. Finally, we may share this information with outside 
          vendors and organizations that provide support services to us or that 
          help us with our marketing programs. We may also provide this information 
          as required by law.</p>
      
      <p>In addition, there may be some other, limited circumstances in which 
        we may share or transfer the information in our databases, for example, 
        to respond to judicial process, to comply with state, federal or local 
        laws, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or Web site, 
        to take precautions against liability, in the event of a corporate reorganization 
        or, to the extent required by law, to provide information to law enforcement 
        agencies.</p>
      <p><b>Safeguarding information </b></p>
      <p>Within the Affiliated Companies, we protect against unauthorized disclosures 
        by limiting access to employees and contractors of the Affiliated Companies 
        who need the information to do their jobs. We also give them clear guidelines 
        for adhering to our confidentiality policies.</p>
      <p>We limit the information we provide to outside companies to only the 
        information we believe is appropriate to enable them to carry out their 
        responsibilities under our contracts or to offer you products and services 
        we think might be of interest to you. <br>
        We contractually require that the information provided be used only for 
        the specifically authorized purpose and that its confidentiality be maintained. 
      </p>
