</ul>
<h3>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h3>
<p>We collect two types of information from our Users:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Information</strong>
<p>The first type of information which we collect is information that identifies or may reasonably identify an individual reasonable effort (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”). Personal Information which is being gathered may consist of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account details</strong>: When you open an account and register to use the Services, you will be asked to provide us certain details about yourself, such as: first and last name, email address, gender, birth date, personal numeric code, age, physical address, ID number, fiscal code, phone number and occupation. In addition, we may collect certain information as required under various gambling regulations, as well as Know Your Client (“<strong>KYC</strong>”) and Anti-Money Laundering (“<strong>AML</strong>”) regulatory requirements, such as your source of funds.</li>
<li><strong>Governmental-issued ID</strong>: In certain instances, you may be required to provide a copy of a governmental-issued ID, for identity verification process. Please note that this information is required for certain features of our Services.</li>
<li><strong>Gaming information</strong>: in order for us to provide the Services, we automatically record different information related to your account and use of our Services, including with respect to your transactions, deposits, balances, bets, withdraws, bonuses and winnings. We also collect information regarding potential gambling problems or addictions, based on your patterns of gambling across our services, in order to ensure a responsible gaming environment and as required by law.</li>
<li><strong>Financial information</strong>: In order for you to enjoy all of the functions of the Services (e.g. place bets, perform purchases, play in tournaments, etc.), payment information will be collected from you, such as your currency, credit card number, payment method and bank account details.</li>
<li><strong>Voluntary information</strong>: We also collect information which you provide us voluntarily, such as information provided by our VIP customers. For example, when you respond to communications from us, communicate with us via email or share additional information about yourself through your use of the Services, such as on the chat feature and in games. This includes information you are willing to share with us for the purpose of improving and developing our relationship with you, as well as for maintaining your stratification from our services (for example, information about your marital status and family, your hobbies and interests, and other information you share with us through surveys).</li>
<li><strong>Device information</strong>: We collect specific types of connection details and information with regard to your device, software or hardware that may identify you, such as: device’s unique identifiers (e.g. UDID, IMEI and MAC address), browser fingerprinting, IP address and geo-location data.</li>
<li><strong>Telephone calls</strong>: We record or monitor telephone calls for customer support, training and/or security purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong>: during our events, we conduct interview and take photos and videos, which may feature attendees, speakers, sponsors or exhibitors. Where photos and videos are taken that feature you as an attendee, speaker, sponsor or exhibitor, we may use those photos and videos for promotional purposes. We may also use your interview for promotional purposes (such as by quoting you).</li>
<li><strong>Social networks</strong>: When you register through your social network account (such as your Facebook account), to use the Services or connect your player account with such account, we will have access to basic information from your social network account, such as your name, birthdate, profile picture and friends' list, as well as information you made publicly available on such account.</li>
<li>In addition, when using the Services, you may be able via your social network to "Invite a Friend" to use the Services. Should the person accept your invitation, we may obtain Personal Information from him/her such as: name, email address, phone number and date of birth. We will use the Personal Information for the purposes set out herein and disclose such information only to third parties as detailed in this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><strong>Information we collect from third parties</strong>: We collect Personal Information from third party service providers, such as information about your credit history from credit agencies and other financial information which is relevant to the provision of the Services, as well as information which is gathered in order to verify your identity and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Non-personal Information</strong>
<p>The second type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a User(s), which may be made available or gathered via the User’s use of the Services (“Non-Personal Information”).</p>
<p>Non-Personal Information which is being collected consists of technical information and aggregated usage information, and may contain, among other things, the User’s operating system, type of browser, screen resolution, browser and keyboard language, the User’s ‘click-stream’ and activities on the Services, the period of time the User visited the Services and related time stamps, etc.</p>
<p><strong>For avoidance of doubt, any Non-personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists.</strong></p>
<p>Types of Non-personal Information we collect from or about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log-in history and technical information</strong>: In order to enhance the functionality of the Services and to provide you with a better user experience, we collect technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information (e.g. the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Services; etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Gameplay information</strong>: We record game play information including, amongst other things, your deposits, bets, bonuses, game session duration and your high scores. We may also share and publish such information through any of our Platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Device and connection information</strong>: we collect information from the particular device you are using, for security and fraud detection and prevention purposes. For example, we may gather information with regard to other software which is running simultaneously with the Software for detecting if you are using software which is associated with fraudulent activity (e.g. robots, malware, etc.) or checking if the connection you are using is via a VPN or proxy.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics information</strong>: We collect information about your use of the Services, such as applications' usage, log files, user activity (e.g. pages viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, online browsing, clicks, actions, etc.), time stamps, alerts, etc. This information is collected for amongst other things troubleshooting errors and bugs as well as for research and analytics purposes about your use of the Services.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous information</strong>: We may anonymize or de-identify the information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information cannot, on its own, personally identify you. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation and for any purpose, such as for advertising or marketing purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>CONDITIONS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>We will process your Personal Information for a variety of reasons, each of which is prescribed by relevant data protection laws.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fulfillment of a contract, compliance with a legal obligation</strong>
<br>

<li>For Users of our betting products that are located in Germany, personal information will be also transmitted to SCHUFA, as explained below:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Data transmission to SCHUFA – the Company transmits personal data related to the request for, performance of and termination of the respective business relationship to SCHUFA Holding AG, Kormoranweg 5, 65201 Wiesbaden along with data about non-contractual behaviour or fraudulent behaviour collected within the scope of this contractual relationship.</li>
<li>The legal basis for these transfers is Article 6(1)(b) and Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Transfers on the basis of Article 6(1)(f)f GDPR may only take place if this is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the business partner or a third party and does not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data. The data exchange with SCHUFA also serves the fulfilment of legal obligations to carry out creditworthiness checks of customers (Sections 505a and 506 of the Civil Code). This also includes fraud prevention.</li>
<li>SCHUFA processes the data received and also uses it for the purpose of scoring in order to provide its contractual partners in the European Economic Area and in Switzerland and, if applicable, other third countries (provided that the European Commission has made an adequacy decision in this regard) with information, inter alia, for assessing the creditworthiness of natural persons. Independent of credit rating scoring, SCHUFA supports its business partners by creating profiles for recognising conspicuous facts (e.g. for the purpose of fraud prevention in mail order transactions). For this purpose, inquiries from SCHUFA business partners are analysed in order to examine them for potential anomalies. In addition to inquiries from the past ninety days, this calculation – which is carried out individually for the respective business partner - may also include address data, information whether and in which function an entry on a person in public life with matching personal data is included in generally accessible sources, as well as aggregated statistical information from the SCHUFA database. This procedure has no effect on SCHUFA's credit assessment and credit rating scoring.</li>
<li>Further information on the activities of SCHUFA can be found in the SCHUFA Information Sheet or online at <a href="www.schufa.de/datenschutz" target="_blank">www.schufa.de/datenschutz</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Since we operate globally, it may be necessary for the provision of Services and to the extent required for the specific purpose, as stipulated in this Privacy Policy to transfer your Personal Information to countries outside the European Economic Area. The data protection and other laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>We use best efforts to ensure that your Personal Information is protected in accordance with our Privacy Policy, through contractual means (such as by using the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission for data transfer, as available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" target="_blank">here</a>) or other means (such as ensuring that the European Commission decisions determined that such jurisdictions offer adequate level of protection, as available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
