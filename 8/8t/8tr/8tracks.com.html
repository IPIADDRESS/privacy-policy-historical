<h2><b>Privacy policy</b> </h2>
<p><b>Last Revised:  May 13, 2010 </b><br>
</p>


<p>This website – <a href="http://8tracks.com" rel="external">http://8tracks.com</a> – 
(the “Website”) is owned and operated by 8tracks, Inc. (“<b>8tracks</b>” 
or “<b>We</b>”).  We understand you value your privacy.  
At 8tracks, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.  
This statement governs information you provide to us or we learn from 
your use of this Website and tells you how we may collect, use and, 
in some instances, share this information. <br></p>
<p><u>The Information 8tracks Collects</u> <br>
</p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><b><i>Information You Provide</i></b>: 
  You may provide to 8tracks what is generally called "personally 
  identifiable" information (such as your name, age, zip code, email 
  address, credit card number, postal mailing address, and telephone numbers) 
  if you use certain services or products from the 8tracks Platform or 
  otherwise use the features and functionality of the 8tracks Platform.</li>
  
  <li><i>"</i><b><i>Automatically 
  Collected</i></b><i>" Information:</i> When you access the 8tracks 
  Platform (including through your computer or your mobile device) or 
  open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information 
  from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This 
  "automatically collected" information may include Internet 
  Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, version 
  of software installed, system type, your listening preferences, the 
  content and pages that you access on the 8tracks Platform, and the dates 
  and times that you visit the 8tracks Platform.</li>
  <li><i>"</i><b><i>Cookies</i></b><i>" 
  Information</i>: When you access the 8tracks Platform, we may send one 
  or more cookies — small text files containing a string of alphanumeric 
  characters — to your computer. 8tracks may use both session cookies 
  and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close 
  your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser 
  and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the 8tracks 
  Platform in order to improve your experience, as explained in B below. 
  Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" 
  file to learn the best way to modify your cookie settings.</li>
  
  <li><i>Your User ID</i>: Your 
  User ID is displayed throughout the 8tracks Platform and is therefore 
  available to the public. Other people can see your feedback, ratings 
  and associated comments, etc. Therefore, if you associate your actual 
  name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name 
  will be able to personally identify your activities on the 8tracks Platform.</li>
  
</ul>
<p><b><u>The Way 8tracks Uses Information</u></b>.<b>  </b>
8tracks uses the information that you provide or that we collect to 
operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services 
found on the 8tracks Platform as well as to track user-generated content 
and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with 
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws. <br>
</p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li>We may use your email address, 
  without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying 
  you of major 8tracks Platform updates, for customer service purposes, 
  and to send privacy or security related notices.</li>
  
  <li>8tracks uses all of the information 
  that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our 
  Users, to improve the way the 8tracks Platform works and looks, and 
  to create new features and functionality.</li>
  
  <li>8tracks may use "Automatically 
  Collected" information and "Cookies" information to: 
  (a) automatically update the 8tracks application on your system; (b) 
  remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during 
  your visit or the next time you access the 8tracks Platform; (c) provide 
  customized third-party advertisements, content and information; (d) 
  monitor and report on the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; 
  (e) monitor and report aggregate usage metrics such as total number 
  of visitors and pages accessed; and (d) track your entries, submissions, 
  and status in any promotions or other activities.</li>
  
</ul>
<p><b><u>When 8tracks Discloses Information</u></b>.<b>  </b>
8tracks does not share your personally identifiable information with 
other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without 
your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personally 
identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any 
publicly available portion of the 8tracks Platform — such as when 
you publish contact information to complete your profile information 
— becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others 
without restriction. <br></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li>8tracks may disclose Automatically 
  Collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information 
  (such as IP addresses, anonymous User usage data, listening preferences, 
  referring or exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks) 
  with interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding 
  the usage and demographic patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, 
  promotions, or other functionality on the 8tracks Platform.</li>
  
  <li>We may disclose some limited 
  User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons 
  to: provide website hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill 
  orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; 
  and assist 8tracks in improving the 8tracks Platform and creating new 
  services features. We contractually require that these parties process 
  such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize 
  only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties 
  to use reasonable confidentiality measures.</li>
  <li>8tracks may disclose User 
  information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief 
  that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws 
  (such as U.S. copyright or trademark law) or respond to a court order, 
  judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required 
  by the requesting entity.</li>
  
  <li>8tracks also reserves the 
  right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is 
  appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce 
  our Terms of Use; protect 8tracks from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful 
  uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims 
  or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect 
  the security or integrity of the 8tracks Platform; or to protect the 
  rights, property, or personal safety of 8tracks, our Users, or others.</li>
  
</ul>
<p><b><u>Your Choices and Access to your 
Personal Information</u></b>.<b>  </b>
You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information 
with 8tracks, in which case 8tracks will not be able to provide to you 
some of the features and functionality found on the 8tracks Platform. 
You may view, update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences 
by contacting us at privacy@8<a name="0.2__Hlt79693050"></a><a href="http://tracks.com" rel="external">tracks.com</a>. <br></p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, 
we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you 
account access or making corrections to your information. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION 
AT ALL TIMES. <br></p>
<p><b><u>Advertisers</u></b>.<b>  </b>
8tracks allows third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements 
within the 8tracks Platform. These third-party ad servers or ad networks 
may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements 
that appear within the 8tracks Platform and they automatically receive 
your IP Address and other automatically collected information when this 
happens. Such third-party ad servers may also use other technologies 
(such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness 
of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.</p>
<p>8tracks does not provide your personally 
identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks 
without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks 
8tracks to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment 
and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may 
conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were 
trying to reach. <br></p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy 
policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for further 
information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control 
the activities of, such other advertisers or websites. 8tracks reserves 
the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in 
its discretion and 8tracks may not at all times list such updated ad 
network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy. <br>
</p>

8tracks uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical 
safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. 
We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information 
you transmit to 8tracks, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive 
your transmission of information, 8tracks makes commercially reasonable 
efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note 
that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, 
disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, 
or managerial safeguards. If 8tracks learns of a security systems breach, 
then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take 
appropriate protective steps. 8tracks may post a notice on the 8tracks 
Platform if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you 
may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

that reason, 8tracks does not knowingly collect or maintain personally 
identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If 8tracks

then 8tracks will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. <br>
</p>

information deleted. <br></p>

non-U.S. territories, please note that any data you enter into the 8tracks 
Platform will be transferred outside the European Union or such other 
non-U.S. territory for use by 8tracks and its affiliates for any of 
the purposes described herein. In addition, because 8tracks operates

Other Change in Conrol</u></b>.<b>  </b>
In the event that 8tracks is acquired by or merged with a third-party

of the information you disclose to them. 8tracks does not control the 
privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy 
policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to
