        2.1 Summary
        </h3>
        <p>
        Most Helix web sites use "cookies," small pieces of data that can be read
        by a web server in the same domain that put the cookie on your hard drive.
        We may use cookies to help us retrieve your preferences and settings; help
        with sign-in; to combat fraud; and analyze site operations.
        </p>
        <p>
        We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and compile analytics.
        These may include third-party web beacons, which are prohibited from
        collecting your personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
        You have a variety of tools to control cookies and similar technologies,

        <h4>
        2.2.1 Our Use of Cookies
        </h4>
        <p>
        Most Helix web sites use âcookies,â which are small pieces of data sent to
        your browser by a web server. Upon subsequent requests, your browser will
        send the cookie data to the same web server, or other web servers in the
        same domain, when accessing the web site. Cookies contain data that can be
        read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. That data
        often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies
        your computer but may contain other information as well. Here is an example
        of a unique ID number stored in a cookie that Helix might place on your
        device when you visit one of our web sites:
        9ha56er983130kmrtsx6jjabseniu65sjdjnnu9
        </p>
        <p>
        We may use cookies for:
        </p>
        <p>
        - Sign-in and Authentication
        <br>
        When you sign in to a site or service using your account on an Helix web
        site, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an
        encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from
        page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When
        you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. This is
        commonly referred to as a âsession cookieâ. We also use cookies to improve
        the sign-in experience. For example, your user name may be stored in a
        cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie
        allows your user name to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to
        type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public
        computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the
        appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be
        used.
        </p>
        <p>
        - Site Analytics
        <br>
        We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or
        service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of
        our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the
        performance of these sites and services.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition to the cookies Helix may set when you visit our web sites,
        third parties may also set certain cookies on your device when you visit
        Helix sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party
        to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other
        cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third
        parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad
        networks. Because your browser connects to those third partiesâ web servers
        to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their
        own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online
        activities across websites or online services.

        2.2.2 How to Control Cookies
        </h4>
        <p>
        - Browser Controls to Block Cookies.
        <br>
        Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify
        your browser setting to block cookies. Instructions for blocking cookies in
        different browsers are usually available at each browserâs privacy
        statement or in their help files or settings pages.
        <br>
        Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to
        sign in or use other interactive features of Helix sites and services that
        depend on cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
        - Browser Controls to Delete Cookies
        <br>
        If you accept cookies, you can delete them later. Instructions for deleting
        cookies in different browsers are usually available at each browserâs
        privacy statement or in their help files or settings pages.
        <br>
        Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and
        preferences controlled by those cookies will be deleted and may need to be
        recreated.
        </p>
        <p>
        - Browser Controls for âDo Not Trackâ and Tracking Protection
        <br>
        Some newer browsers have incorporated âDo Not Trackâ features. Most of
        these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web
        sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites
        (or the third party content on those sites) may continue to engage in
        activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this
        preference, depending on the sitesâ privacy practices. Because there is not
        yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Helix does
        not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on its own websites or
        online services, or on third-party websites or online services where Helix
        provides content or is otherwise able to collect information.

        2.2.3 Our Use of Web Beacons
        </h4>
        <p>
        Helix web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons -
        sometimes called single pixel gifs - that may be used to help deliver
        cookies on our sites, let us count users who have visited those pages and
        deliver co-branded services. We may include web beacons in our promotional
        e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been
        opened and acted upon.
        </p>
        <p>
        Finally, Helix sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us
        compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our
        promotional campaigns or other web site operations. These web beacons may
        allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer. These
        companies may collect information about your online activities across
        websites or online servers, however, we prohibit third parties from using
        web beacons on our sites to collect or access your personal information.
        You may be able to opt out from data collection or use by these third-party
        analytics companies by opting out on their respective web sites.

        In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, web sites can use other
        technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This may be
        done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by
        storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, it can also be
        used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used
        to track behavior.

        Web sites that use Adobe Flash technologies may use Local Shared Objects or
        "Flash cookies" to store data on your computer. Note that the ability to
        clear Flash cookies may or may not be controlled by your browser setting

        11.2.3 Protecting the Security of Personal Information
        </h4>
        <p>
        Helix is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.
        We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect
        your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For
        example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems
        that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. When we transmit
        highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password)
        over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the
        Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
        If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal
        information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.
        Do not share it. If you are sharing a computer, you should always log out
        before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from
        subsequent users.
        </p>
        <h4>
        11.2.4 Where Information is Stored and Processed
        </h4>
        <p>
        Personal information collected on Helix sites and services may be stored
        and processed in the United States or any other country where Helix or its
        affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. We take
        steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is
        processed according to the provisions of this statement and the
        requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.
        </p>
        <p>
        Helix may retain your personal information for a variety of reasons, such
        as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our
        agreements, and as long as necessary to provide services. To learn how to
        access your personal information, visit Accessing Your Information.

        11.2.5 Changes to Our Privacy Statements
        </h4>
        <p>
        We will occasionally update our privacy statements to reflect customer
        feedback and changes in our services. When we post changes to a statement,
        we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of the statement. If
        there are material changes to the statement or in how Helix will use your
        personal information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a
        notice of such changes before they take effect or by directly sending you a
        notification. We encourage you to periodically review the privacy
        statements for the products and services you use to learn how Helix is
        protecting your information.
