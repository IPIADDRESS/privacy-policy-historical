<p align="center"><strong><u>8COUPONS INC. Privacy Policy</u></strong></p>
<p>8coupons inc. (“8coupons” or “our”, “us” or “we”) understands that its customers, visitors, users, and others who use <a href="http://www.8coupons.com/">www.8coupons.com</a> or other websites owned or operated by 8coupons (collectively or individually “Users” or “you”) value their privacy. This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected on the 8coupons Website (as hereinafter defined). 8coupons provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Website.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date.</strong></p>
<p>The most recent version of this Privacy Policy is effective as of July 16, 2007.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to 8coupons and/or other affiliated Websites or entities controlled by, or under common control with and through 8coupons (each such Website being individually referred to herein as the “Website”). 8coupons respects the privacy of its users, and this Privacy Policy details the information that is collected on our Website and how such information is used by 8coupons. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the Terms of Use posted at our Website, which governs your use of the Website. Your use of the Website indicates to us that you have read and accepted our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy and in our Terms of Use.&nbsp; Finally your use of the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Please note that any video, image, or other content posted at the direction of Users onto the Website becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Applicability.</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy only applies to Websites owned and/or operated by or for 8coupons, and upon which 8coupons has placed a “link” which, when “clicked”, transfers you to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at this Website, and does not cover any information collected by any other Website (unless otherwise specifically stated or disclosed by 8coupons), its corporate affiliates, licensees or any other company.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Information.</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Personally      Identifiable Information: You provide certain personally identifiable      information (such as your name, address, birth date or e-mail address and      referred to in this Privacy Policy as “PI”) to 8coupons when choosing to      participate in various activities on the Website such as uploading videos,      posting reviews in our forums, message board, or in the video comments      section if applicable, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage      of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or      other mailing lists.&nbsp;      Generally, you may browse our Website without providing us with PI.      However, there may be times when we ask you to provide us with certain PI,      such as when you choose to register with our Website. We may also ask you      to provide us with demographic information or information regarding your      interests, hobbies or similar information to enhance your online      experience. 8coupons reserves the right, at any time, to modify, alter or      add features to our Website that require you to register or otherwise      provide additional PI or to require registration to access our Website.      You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be      able to participate in or view some of the Website’s features. 8coupons      does not sell, rent or share PI collected with other people other than      that specifically described herein.</li>
  <li>Underage      users:&nbsp; The Website does not      knowingly collect PI from children under thirteen (13) years of age.&nbsp; This is not a Website directed to      children under the age of 13, therefore, 8coupons does not knowingly      collect any information from children under 13 years of age at the Website.      If you are under 13 years of age, do not send any information about      yourself to 8coupons. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has      provided the Website with PI, we will delete that child’s PI from its      system.</li>
  <li>Anonymous      Information: When you visit the Website, our web servers automatically      collect website usage information. Website usage information is anonymous      information that describes how our visitors use and navigate our Website,      and it includes the number and frequency of visitors to each web page,      video and the time-span of their stays. 8coupons collects the anonymous      information automatically sent to us by your web browser, referrer data      that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Website,      and IP address. We may also determine what technology is available through      your browser in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web      page.</li>
  <li>Log      File Information: When visitors call for pages from our Website, our      servers log the visitor’s IP address. 8coupons may collect IP addresses      for a range of internal purposes, such as system administration, to report      aggregate information to our business partners or to review the number of      visits to different pages or videos watched on our Website.</li>
  <li>Cookies      Information: When you visit the Website, 8coupons may send one or more      cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters      - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. 8coupons does      not store any PI in cookies, but it may link the cookie to any information      it collects. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which      is standard in the Internet industry. 8coupons does not control these      cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Privacy Policy. Visitors      to our Website should check the Privacy Policy of the advertiser to      determine how it uses cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse      all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some      features of our Website may not function properly if the ability to accept      cookies is disabled.</li>
  <li>Clear      GIFs Information: When you use the Website, 8coupons may employ “clear      GIFs” which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Users      anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition,      we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track      which emails are opened by recipients.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use of Information.</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>If      you submit PI to 8coupons through the Website, then we may employ your      personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features      and functionality of the Website.&nbsp;      We may also use your PI to contact you regarding your use of our Website      or changes to our Privacy Policy, Terms of Use or other notices or terms      that affect you and your use of our Website.&nbsp; If you e-mail someone else a review or other special      feature from our Website, 8coupons may use the information you provide      about someone else to send that person the requested e-mail.</li>
  <li>Any      PI or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards,      in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be      collected and used by others.</li>
  <li>8coupons      may not use your email address or other PI to send commercial or marketing      messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or      feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may,      however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing      or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Website changes      or for customer service purposes).</li>
  <li>8coupons      may use both your PI and certain non-personally-identifiable information      to improve the quality and design of the Website and to create new      features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking,      and analyzing User preferences and trends.</li>
  <li>8coupons      may use cookies, clear gifs, and log file PI to: (a) retain information so      that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time      you visit the Website; (b) supply custom, personalized content and      information; (c) examine the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d)      monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed,      etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions,      sweepstakes, and contests.</li>
  <li>8coupons      may employ other trusted companies and individuals to perform functions on      our behalf. Examples may include analyzing data, providing marketing assistance      and providing customer service. Such third parties may have access to our      Users’ PI in order to provide these services to us on our behalf solely      for such purposes; however, they are not permitted to use it for any other      purpose.</li>
  <li>8coupons      may not rent, sell or otherwise disclose your PI to third parties unless      disclosed herein or at the time such information is collected or unless      you otherwise give consent, other than in the following limited      circumstances:</li>
  <ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>Legal       Action: 8coupons may disclose information about its users, including PI,       when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental       authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or enforce compliance       with the policies governing our Website and applicable state and federal       laws, or to protest against misuse or unauthorized use of our Website. We       may also disclose user PI whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to       limit our legal liability, to protect or defend our rights or property or       protect the safety, rights or property of our users.&nbsp; We also reserve the right to       disclose PI and/or non-personally-identifiable information that 8coupons       believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce the Terms       of Use</li>
    <li>Corporate       Change: 8coupons may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose user       information, including PI, to a successor entity in connection with a       corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all assets, or       other fundamental corporate change respecting the Website.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Security.</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>You      may decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Website,      in which case 8coupons may not be able to provide certain services to you.      Please note that media files uploaded by Users to the Website cannot be      removed and remain subject to our Terms of Use.</li>
  <li>8coupons      takes steps to secure the data you submit to us, including limiting the      number of people who have physical access to our user data. Unfortunately,      no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be one hundred      percent secure. Therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any      information you transmit to 8coupons, and you do so at your own risk.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong><br clear="all">
</strong>
<p><strong>Consent to Transfer. </strong></p>
<p>The Website is hosted in the United States and is intended for and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing the Website from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Website, which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Use, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance/Changes to Privacy Policy </strong></p>
<p>By using the Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 8coupons reserves the right to modify, alter or otherwise update this Privacy Policy at any time in its sole discretion. We will post any changes here; therefore, please continue to check back from time to time. However, we will only use the PI you provide to the Website in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, unless you give us your consent.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party Advertisers.</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>8coupons      permits other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to      deliver advertisements within the Website. They may also use other tools      to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize      advertising content.</li>
  <li>As      noted above, 8coupons does not provide any PI to these third-party ad      servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a      specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in      or opt-out. However, please note that if 8coupons is requested by an      advertiser to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond      to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may determine that you      fit the profile of the audience it is trying to reach. The advertiser may      also use information regarding your use of the Website, such as the number      of times you viewed an ad (but not any PI), to calculate which ads it      should send to you.</li>
  <li>If      you are concerned with the use of your non personal information by these      third party advertisers, you should consult their respective privacy      policies for more information on their practices and for instructions on      how to opt-out of certain practices. 8coupons’s Privacy Policy does not      apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers      or Websites.</li>
