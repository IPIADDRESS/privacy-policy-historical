<div id="WNStoryBody" class=""><p>We
provide a variety of online web services, mobile applications, and services for
location-enabled and other types of devices (collectively, the "Services") from
news and weather to interactive entertainment to electronic commerce via our
relationship with Gannaway Web Holdings, LLC d/b/a WorldNow
("WorldNow"). WorldNow is the host of this&nbsp;Web site. &nbsp;Because the success of the Services is
dependent on building and maintaining goodwill with our customers, this Web
site and WorldNow (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we" or
"us" or "our") are committed to implementing measures
designed to protect the privacy of those using our services. &nbsp;Moreover, we see it as our responsibility to
set examples and help establish the standards for privacy on the Internet.</p>
<p>Although
we respect the privacy of all those who use our Services, we do collect
information from our members and visitors. This Privacy Policy governs your interaction
with the Services, and your registration for and use of this station's Services.
&nbsp;Except as set forth within this Privacy
Policy and the&nbsp; Terms of Service and/or
other published guidelines, we do not release personally identifiable
information about the Service's members and visitors without their permission.</p>
<p>Please
note that we review these privacy practices from time to time, and that these
practices are therefore subject to change. We ask that you periodically review
this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of
this Web site's Privacy Policy. To contact us about privacy issues, to report a
violation of this Web site's Privacy Policy, or to raise any other issue
regarding the Web site, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:Info@WorldNow.com">Info@WorldNow.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The information we gather</strong></p>
<p>We
gather two types of information about the users of the Services:</p>
<p>(1)
<strong>Non-personally identifiable information:</strong>
When you use the Services, we may collect and aggregate information indicating,
among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were
visited, and which hyperlinks were "clicked." Collecting such
information involves the logging of IP addresses, operating system and browser
software used by each user. Although such information is not personally
identifiable, we can determine from the IP address a visitor's Internet Service
Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>
<p>The
non-personally identifiable information we collect helps us diagnose problems
with our server, administer the Services, identify the most popular areas or
features of the Services, and determine the effectiveness of our promotional
activities. In addition, we may disclose some of this information to
advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have seen and/or clicked
through their advertisements.</p>
<p>For
the same purposes, we use "cookies"---that is, small text files
placed on your computer's hard drive---to help us determine the type of content
and sites to which you link, the length of time you spend at any particular
area or feature of the Services, and your usage of the Services. Cookies also
tell us which advertising you have seen on the Services.&nbsp; At certain times, we may use outside
advertising companies to display advertisements on the Web site that may
contain cookies ("banner ads"). These banner ads collect information
stored by the advertising company and we do not have access to this
information.</p>
<p>Essentially,
cookies are your identification cards for our computers, or servers, that
placed them there. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and
are unable to execute any code or virus. Cookies allow us to serve you better
and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience on the Services.
Nevertheless, you are able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted
by your web browser or device. For more information on how to do so, please
refer to the documentation accompanying your browser or device.</p>
<p>The
Services may also utilize an electronic file called a web beacon to count users
who have visited a web page or recognize users by accessing certain
cookies.&nbsp; We, our third-party suppliers
and/or the web sites and services of advertisers and merchants with which we
have a relationship may use cookies and web beacons (a) for auditing purposes
and to collect information from the web sites of certain advertisers or

<strong>Personally identifiable information:</strong>
Certain features of the Services, such as surveys and contests, may require
that you provide&nbsp;personally identifiable information (including, for
example, zip code, age, income, and e-mail address, and when applicable, credit
card information). WorldNow, as host of the Web site, has access to this
information. In addition, when registering to set up an account to use certain
services of the Web site such as e-mail, chat rooms, and forums, or to receive
certain newsletters or specifically targeted information, we do require that
you provide&nbsp;a valid e-mail address.</p>
<p>In
addition, we may collect information about your location
when you access any of our mobile applications.&nbsp;
If you do not enable the service to use your location information or if
the app does not have that feature, we will not collect or store your location
information.</p>
<p>We
do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
younger than 13 years of age. Before registering for an account to use the
Services of the Web site, we ask that all minors thirteen years old and older
to have their parents read our Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>We
do not control the acts of users of the Services. All users should be aware
that, when they disclose personally identifiable information in a bulletin
board, chat room, guestbook, or other forum, the information may be collected
and used by others to send that person unsolicited e-mail from other parties
outside of the Services or WorldNow. In the event that you encounter any user of
the Services who is improperly collecting or using information about you or
other users, please contact <a href="mailto:Info@WorldNow.com">Info@WorldNow.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How we use (and do not use) the information we
gather</strong></p>
<p>Please
take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways we use the
information that we gather. We cannot and do not assume any responsibility for
any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they
use information received either from us or independently. Nevertheless, in the
event you encounter any third party associated with, or who claims association
with us who you feel is improperly collecting or using information about you,
please contact <a href="mailto:Info@WorldNow.com">Info@WorldNow.com</a>; we will be happy to
forward your message to the third party.</p>
<p>(1)
<strong>How we use (and do not use)
non-personally identifiable information:</strong> We use non-personally identifiable
information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by
performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior
of the users of the Services, and by measuring demographics and interests
regarding specific areas and features of the Services. We provide statistical
information based on this data to advertisers, affiliates, and other current
and potential business partners. We also use the aggregate data to inform these
third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to
their web sites.</p>
<p>The
Services may contain links to other Internet websites and services, including
co-branded or other affiliated sites that may or may not be owned or operated
by us. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the
privacy practices or the content of such websites or services, including their
use of any information (such as IP number, browser type, or operating system)
collected when users or visitors to the Services click through links to those
sites. Even though such information might not identify you personally, we
strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those
sites and services.</p>
<p>(2)
<strong>How we use (and do not use) personally
identifiable information:</strong> This Privacy Policy serves as notice that
personally identifiable information is collected during the registration
process. You may choose to "opt in"&nbsp;to receiving promotional
materials from us and/or our affiliates, advertisers, or other business
partners. If you&nbsp;"opt in" to receiving such promotional
materials, we reserve the right to release any personally identifiable
registration information regarding you to third parties who provide goods or
services that we believe may be of interest to you. We will not release your
credit card information to third parties unless necessary to complete a
transaction between you and such a third party. If you decide that you would like
to discontinue receiving promotional information from such third parties,
please contact those third parties directly, or contact us at <a href="mailto:Info@WorldNow.com">Info@WorldNow.com</a>.</p>
<p>We
limit our own e-mail contact and solicitations to those customers who have
"opted in" to receiving such communications. The solicitations are
limited in that they, among other things, will clearly indicate the originator
of the e-mail and provide the customer with a method of "opting out" of
receiving future communications of a similar nature.</p>
<p>In
addition, as our businesses change, we may buy or sell various assets. In such
cases, personally identifiable information about our users of our Services may
be disclosed to the other party(ies) of the transaction.</p>
<p>In addition,
we sometimes use demographic data to decide which advertisements and sponsor
messages to show to which members. As an example, if Sponsor XYZ wishes to
display their advertising only to female members of the Services, we may use
member registration data to ensure that Sponsor XYZ's ads are displayed only to
female members.</p>
<p>Finally,
we may use individual members' data to "pre-populate" forms, which
are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual data by us and/or our
sponsors. In no case does pre-populating a form transfer any data to any
advertiser or third party. Only if the member voluntarily requests that such
data be transferred will any transfer take place---for example, if/when a
member clicks a "submit form" button or other button.</p>
<p>In
addition, we may use information about your location when you access our mobile
applications to provide location aware products or services and for advertising
purposes, and if you submit video or images for the news, for news reporting
purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, we may provide your location information to third
parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to
you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We
reserve the right to release any and all information contained within our access
logs concerning any visitor or member when that visitor or member is in
violation of our Terms of Service or other published guidelines, or partakes
(or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any illegal activity, even without
a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to release such information in
response to discovery requests, or in response to any circumstance which we, in
our sole discretion, deem an emergency. We cooperate with law enforcement
agencies in identifying those who may be using the Services for illegal
activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity
to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution. We also reserve the right
to comply with subpoenas, warrants, and other court orders requesting information
obtained or any information obtained or stored by us.</p>
<p>If
and when we sponsor promotions or sweepstakes, or third parties sponsor
promotions or sweepstakes in conjunction with us, either we or the third party
will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or
registration area for the promotion or sweepstakes. That privacy information,
to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that
particular promotion or sweepstakes.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>No
security system is impenetrable. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security
of any database that stores personally identifiable information in connection
with the Services, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be
intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Questions
regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to us at <a href="mailto:Info@WorldNow.com">Info@WorldNow.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Changing/deleting personal information</strong></p>
<p>If
you would like to have your personally identifiable information changed or
removed from our database, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Info@WorldNow.com">Info@WorldNow.com</a>, and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request.
Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain
within our databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not
contain such personally identifiable information. The residual information will
not be used for commercial purposes; however we reserve the right, from time to
time, to recontact former customers or users of this Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Ad Serving</strong></p>
<p>We may
use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit this Web
site.&nbsp; These companies may use
information (not including your name, address or telephone number) about your use
of the Services and visits to other web sites and services in order to provide
advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.&nbsp; If you would like more information about this
practice and to know you choices about not having this information used by
