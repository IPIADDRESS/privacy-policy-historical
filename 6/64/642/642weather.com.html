  <p>

  </p>

  When you choose to register an account, or make a donation, you may be asked to provide your
  name, email address, address, city, country, zip code and phone number. <br>
<br>
  What do we do with this information?<br>
 We use the name and email address to send
  you information and updates, and to provide you with correspondence when necessary. We use
  this information to verify registration and/or product offerings.
  We use some of the optional information to help us provide statistics to

  There is additional information that can be gathered by an operating web site.
  One is the IP address (random numbers assigned to individual computers) of the machine you use to reach these
  sites. This
  information is used to help diagnose problems with our web site.
  Your IP address may also be used to block your access
  to areas of the site if we determine that you are abusing the sites resources.

  Another way to gather information is to use a cookie (small text file
  transferred from our Web Site to your hard drive). Our web site uses

  identifiable information and this practice is not currently undertaken.
 </p>

<p>

  without your knowledge. Always use caution when giving out any personally
  identifying information about yourself or your family in any Community.

  in any Community and, therefore, LBW specifically disclaims any

  this Web Site (whether in chat rooms, discussion groups, message boards or
  otherwise) is considered to be non-confidential.

  does not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of
  materials on such third-party Web sites. If you decide to access linked
  third-party Web sites, you do so at your own risk.
</p>

  owners, members and agents, from and against any claims, actions or
  demands, including without limitation reasonable legal and accounting fees,

  to you promptly of any such claim, suit, or proceeding and shall reasonably
  assist you, at your expense, in defending any such claim, suit or proceeding.
