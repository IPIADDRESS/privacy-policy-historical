        Policy below governs your account and any information you provide on 6dgr.<br>
        <br>
        A. Overview<br>
        B. Information We Collect<br>
        C. Our Use and Disclosure of Information<br>
        D. Information Security<br>
        E. Accessing and Changing Your Information<br>
        F. Contacting Us<br>
        <br><br>
        <b>A. Overview</b> <br><br>
        In order to offer some of 6dgr's Services and reduce fraud, 6dgr ("6dgr" 
        or "WE") may ask you to provide us information about yourself such as 
        : name and email address, gender, age, occupation, and location. 6dgr 
        is a unique online community promoting wealth building and financial responsibility. 
        6dgr connects people through an invitation only approach that creates 
        a specialized network of friends and their respective group affiliations. 
        To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles, which are shown 
        to the people in their personal network. A personal network consists of 
        a user's friends as well as the extended group of people that a user is 
        connected to via chains of mutual friends. To fulfill the purpose of this 
        site, some personal information we ask for is displayed to people within 
        these personal networks.<br>
        <br><br>
        This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we use 
        that information. WE take the privacy of your personal information very 
        seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms 
        of this Privacy Policy. We will not sell nor rent your personally identifiable 
        information or a list of our customers to third parties. However, as described 
        in more detail in Part C below, there are limited circumstances in which 
        some of your information will be shared with third parties, under strict 
        restrictions, so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy. 
        This Privacy Policy applies to all services that are hosted on the 6dgr 
        Web Site, whether 6dgr (or its subsidiaries or its affiliates) offers 
        the services. <br>
        <br><br>
        This site may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that WE 
        are not responsible for the privacy practices of other Web sites. We encourage 
        our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy 
        statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable 
        information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected 
        by this Web site. <br>
        <br><br>
        By accepting the Privacy Policy and <a href="index.php?mode=terms">Terms 
        and Conditions</a> in registration, you expressly consent to our use and 
        disclosure of your personal information in the manner described in this 
        Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to 
        the terms of the 6dgr <a href="index.php?mode=terms">Terms and Conditions.</a><br>
        <br><br>
        Your personal information will be stored and processed on our computers 
        in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United 
        States may be less stringent than the laws of your country, but WE will 
        hold and transmit your personal information in a safe, confidential and 
        secure environment. If you object to your personal information being transferred 
        or used as described in this Privacy Policy, please do not register for 
        the 6dgr service.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Notification of Changes</i></b><br>
        <br><br>
        This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the 
        6dgr Service or as we incorporate suggestions from our customers. If we 
        are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information 
        in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected 
        the information, you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or 
        disclose your information in this new manner. Any material changes will 
        be effective only after we provide you by e-mail with at least 30 days' 
        notice of the amended Privacy Policy (if you have closed your 6dgr account, 
        you will not be contacted to notify you of the amended Policy and your 
        personal information will not be used or disclosed in this new manner).<br>
        <br><br>
        We will post the amended Privacy Policy prominently on our website so 
        that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use 
        that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check 
        the 6dgr Web Site <a href="http://www.6dgr.com">http://www.6dgr.com</a> at 
        any time for the most current version of our Privacy Policy.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b>B. Information We Collect</b><br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Required Information</i></b><br>
        <br><br>
        To open a 6dgraccount, you must provide your name, company name (if applicable), 
        phone number, and e-mail address. In order to receive payments through 
        6dgr, you must apply for and receive a 6dgr financial product offered 
        on the Web Site. For your enhanced security, we may also ask you to choose 
        different security questions to answer. This required information may 
        be necessary for us to process transactions, issue a new password if you 
        forget or lose your password, protect you against credit card fraud, and 
        to contact you should the need arise in administering your account.<br>
        <br><br>
        In order to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, we may also require additional 
        information if you receive certain high-value transactions or high overall 
        payment volumes through 6dgr. If you choose to register or apply for certain 
        optional features or products offered through the 6dgr WebSites, you will 
        be required to provide additional information to establish that you qualify 
        for such features or products.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Transaction Information</i></b><br>
        <br><br>
        When you use 6dgr to send money to someone else or request money from 
        someone else, we ask you to provide information related to each transaction, 
        including the amount of the transaction and the e-mail address of the 
        third party. We retain this information for each of your transactions 
        through 6dgr. We also collect the Internet address (IP address) of the 
        computer or device you use to access your 6dgr account, in order to help 
        detect possible instances of unauthorized transactions.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Information About You From Third Parties</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        In order to protect all our Members against potential fraud, we may verify 
        with third parties the information you provide. In the course of such 
        verification, we receive personally identifiable information about you 
        from such services. In particular, when you register a 6dgr checking, 
        savings, brokerage, debit or credit card with 6dgr, we may use standard 
        authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information 
        and address matches the information that you supplied to 6dgr, and that 
        the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.<br>
        <br><br>
        If you receive high overall payment volumes through 6dgr, in some circumstances 
        we may conduct a background check on you or your business by obtaining 
        information about you and your business from a credit bureau or a business 
        information service. If you incur a debt to 6dgr, we will generally conduct 
        a credit check on you by obtaining additional information about you from 
        a credit bureau, to the extent permitted by law. 6dgr, at its sole discretion, 
        also reserves the right periodically to retrieve and review a business 
        or consumer credit report for any account, and reserves the right to close 
        an account based on information obtained during this credit review process.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Additional Verification</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        If we cannot verify the information that you provide, or if you request 
        a withdrawal by check to an address other than your verified credit card 
        billing address, we may ask you to send us additional information (such 
        as your drivers' license, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility 
        bill or other information linking you to the applicable address), or to 
        answer additional questions online to help verify your information.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Website Traffic Information</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        Because of the way that Internet communication standards work, when you 
        arrive at or leave the 6dgr Web Site, we automatically receive the Internet 
        address of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect 
        information on which pages of our website you visit while you are on the 
        6dgr Web Site, the type of browser you use and the times you access our 
        website. We may use this information only to try to understand our customers' 
        preferences better and to manage the load on our servers, so as to improve 
        our service and your experience with 6dgr. We do not track the websites 
        that you visit before or after you leave the 6dgr site. <br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Our Use of "Cookies"</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        "Cookies" are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow 
        us to recognize you as a 6dgr customer. If you return to the 6dgr site 
        using the same computer and browser, We send a "session cookie" to your 
        computer when you log in to your account by entering your e-mail address 
        and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple 
        pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter 
        your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, 
        these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect. <br>
        <br><br>
        We also use longer-lasting cookies to display your e-mail address on our 
        sign-in form, so that you don't have to retype the e-mail address each 
        time when you log in to your 6dgr account. <br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Customer Service Correspondence</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        If you send us correspondence, we may retain such information in the records 
        of your account. We may also retain customer service correspondence and 
        other correspondence from 6dgr to you. We may retain these records in 
        order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate 
        potential fraud and violations of our Terms and Conditions. We may, over 
        time, delete these records if permitted by law. <br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        From time to time, we may offer optional questionnaires and surveys to 
        our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing 
        users' interests and needs. The use of the information collected will 
        be explained in detail in the survey itself. If we collect personally 
        identifiable information from our users in these questionnaires and surveys, 
        the users will be given notice of how the information will be used prior 
        to their participation in the survey or questionnaire.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Email Choice/Opt-out</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        Users who no longer wish to receive our weekly updates or newsletter may 
        opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions 
        contained in the email or by logging-in and changing their settings in 
        the Account Tab section of the site. <br>
        <br><br>
        <b>C. Our Use and Disclosure of Information</b><br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Internal Uses</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        Profile information as well as first name and photos are displayed to 
        people in a user's personal network, to support the function of the site 
        as a business networking community where users can meet new people through 
        their friends. Email address and full name are used when a user invites 
        a friend via email to join the Service, when a user requests to add another 
        user to their friend list, and when we send notifications to a user related 
        to their use of the Service. Except when inviting or adding friends, a 
        user's email address is not shared or displayed with people within a user's 
        personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on 6dgr 
        with each other through the 6dgr Service, without disclosing email addresses. 
        We may also use a user's email address to send weekly updates or news 
        regarding our site, but the user may choose not to receive email of this 
        type by accessing their Account Tab Info.<br>
        <br><br>
        We collect, store and process your personal information on servers located 
        in the United States. We use the information we collect about you in order 
        to provide our Services and process your transactions, to provide customer 
        service, to determine your eligibility to receive offers for special features 
        or products, and to improve our products and services. At your option 
        (as indicated in your user settings), we use the information you provide 
        to access specific third party services on your behalf and perform the 
        actions that you request us to perform.<br>
        <br><br>
        We give access to individually identifiable information about our users 
        only to those employees who require it to fulfill customer service requests. 
        <br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Invite a Friend</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        If a user elects to use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our site, 
        we ask them for the friend's email address. WE will automatically send 
        the friend an email inviting them to join the site. WE store this email 
        address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the 
        friends list of the user sending the invitation, and also to send reminders 
        of the invitation. 6dgr does not sell these email addresses or use them 
        to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. 
        The friend may contact 6dgr to request the removal of this information 
        from our database.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information 
        online - for example, on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas 
        - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting 
        personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive 
        unsolicited messages from other parties in return.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Disclosure to Other Customers</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        If you are a registered user, your name, e-mail address, date of sign-up, 
        and other information may be displayed to other 6dgr Members whom you 
        have signed-up or who are attempting to sign up through 6dgr. Your credit 
        card or debit card number and any other financial information will never 
        be revealed to anyone whom you have invited or who has accepted through 
        6dgr, except if we are required to do so pursuant to a state or federal 
        law. <br>
        If you are buying goods or services and paying through 6dgr, the seller 
        of the goods or services may request that you provide a mailing address 
        that 6dgr has confirmed as matching the billing address in the credit 
        card system. You do not have to provide this information. If you do not 
        provide the information, however, the seller may choose not to accept 
        your payment and not to complete the transaction. <br>
        <br><br>
        6dgr may also disclose to other customers the number of payments you have 
        received from "VERIFIED" or "CERTIFIED" customers (as defined in the Terms 
        and Conditions on the 6dgr site), or other aggregate measures that provide 
        an indication of your reputation with other customers.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Disclosure to Third Parties Other Than Customers</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        6dgr will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information 
        to third parties. 6dgr will not share any of your personally identifiable 
        information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described 
        below, or with your express permission (and to other customers as described 
        above). These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using 
        the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the 
        information is shared. We share information with companies that help us 
        process the transactions you request and protect our customers' transactions 
        from fraud, such as sharing your credit card number with a service that 
        screens for lost and stolen card numbers. See "Information About You From 
        Third Parties" in Section B above. <br>
        <br><br>
        We disclose the information we collect, as described in Section B above, 
        to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other 
        financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. These 
        companies may be subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other 
        legal restrictions that prohibit using the information except to market 
        the specified 6dgr-related products or services, unless you have affirmatively 
        agreed or given your prior permission for other uses.<br>
        <br><br>
        We disclose information that we in good faith believe is appropriate to 
        cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to 
        conduct investigations of violations of our <a href="index.php?mode=terms">Terms 
        and Conditions.</a> Specifically, this means that if we conduct a fraud 
        investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, 
        we can give that person or entity's contact information (but not bank 
        account or credit card information) to victims who request it. <br>
        We disclose information in response to State and federal court orders. 
        <br>
        <br><br>
        If a user signs up for a co-branded version of a 6dgrthrough links on 
        our co-branded partner's website, 6dgr will share with the co-branded 
        partner that user's name, e-mail address and physical address in order 
        to provide enhanced integration between 6dgr's Services and the services 
        of our co-branded partner. If a user does not want his or her information 
        shared with 6dgr's co-branded partner, he or she should not use this aspect 
        of the site. <br>
        <br><br>
        We disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as 
        the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed 
        for you) after proof of same is provided to us.<br>
        <br><br>
        We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for 
        public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage 
        of our users live in British Columbia. However, this aggregated information 
        is not tied to personally identifiable information.<br>
        <br><br>
        As with any other business, it is possible that 6dgr in the future could 
        merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, 
        the successor company would have access to the information maintained 
        by 6dgr, including customer account information, but would continue to 
        be bound by this Privacy Policy unless an until it is amended as described 
        in Section A above.<br>
        <br><br>
        We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures 
        to help coordinate the services we provide to you, enforce our terms and 
        conditions, and promote trust and safety. <br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Third Party Advertising</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by our Web advertising 
        partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. Doing this allows 
        the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online 
        advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about 
        where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements 
        and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad 
        network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of 
        most interest to you. 6dgr does not have access to nor control of the 
        cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. 
        This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by 6dgr and does not cover 
        the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Our Contacts with Customers</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        We communicate with users on a regular basis via e-mail to provide requested 
        services, and we also communicate by phone to resolve customer complaints 
        or investigate suspicious transactions. We use your e-mail address to 
        confirm your opening of a 6dgr account, to send you notice of payments 
        that you send or receive through 6dgr (including referral payments described 
        below), to send information about important changes to our products and 
        services, and to send notices and other disclosures required by law. Generally, 
        users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily 
        informational in nature rather than promotional.<br>
        <br><br>
        We also may use your e-mail address to send you other types of communications 
        that you can control, including tips, newsletters, customer surveys and 
        notice of special third-party promotions. You can choose whether to receive 
        some, all or none of these communications when you complete the registration 
        process, or at any time thereafter, by logging in to your account on the 
        6dgr Web Site and changing your user preferences. You can also change 
        your choices at any time through the same procedure.<br>
        <br><br>
        In connection with independent audits of our financial statements and 
        operations, auditors may seek to contact a sample of our customers to 
        confirm that our records are accurate. However, these auditors cannot 
        use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Internet Address Information</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        We use IP addresses, browser types and access times to analyze trends, 
        administer the site, improve site performance and gather broad demographic 
        information for aggregate use. <br>
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Your Use of Information and Our Services</i></b><br>
        <br>
        <br><br>
        In order to facilitate the transactions between <b>6dgr</b> members and 
        the 6dgr financial partner network, our Service allows the financial partner's 
        limited access to your contact information. <br>
        <br><br>
        By entering into our <a href="index.php?mode=terms">Terms and Conditions,</a> 
        you agree that, with respect to other users' personally identifiable information 
        that you obtain through the site or through an 6dgr related communication 
        or 6dgr facilitated transaction, you will only use this information for: 
        (a) 6dgr related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages<br>
        (b) using Services offered through 6dgr.<br>
        (c) any other purpose that such user expressly agrees to after adequate 
        disclosure of the purpose(s).<br>
        <br><br>
        In all cases, you must provide users with the opportunity to remove themselves 
        from your database and review any information you have collected about 
        them. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, 
        can you disclose personally identifiable information about another 6dgr 
        user to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other 
        user after adequate disclosure. Note that law enforcement personnel and 
        other rights holders are given different rights with respect to information 
        they access.<br>
        <br><br>
        6dgr does not tolerate unsolicited commercial e-mail or "spam". Therefore, 
        without limiting the foregoing, you may not add a 6dgr user to your mail 
        list (e-mail or physical mail) without their express consent after adequate 
        disclosure, even if said user has previously had their profile set to 
        accept all messages. Our anti-spam policy is strictly enforced.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b>D. Information Security</b><br>
        <br><br>
        We handle your customer information with high standards of information 
        security. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information 
        to employees who need to know that information in order to provide products 
        or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards 
        that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal 
        information.<br>
        <br><br>
        The security of your account also relies on your protection of your password. 
        You should not share your password with anyone.<b>Our representatives 
        will never ask you for your password, so any e-mail or other communication 
        requesting your password should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious.</b> 
        If you do share your password with a third party for any reason, including 
        because the third party has promised to provide you additional services 
        such as account aggregation, the third party will have access to your 
        account and your personal information, and you may be responsible for 
        actions taken using your password. If you believe someone else has obtained 
        access to your password, please change it immediately by logging in to 
        your account at 6dgr and changing your user settings, and also contact 
        us right away as described in Section F below.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b>E. Accessing and Changing Your Information</b><br>
        <br><br>
        You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired 
        changes to such information, or to the settings for your account, at any 
        time by logging in to your account on the 6dgr Web Site and changing your 
        user preferences. You can also close your account through the 6dgr Web 
        Site. If you close your account, we will mark your account in our database 
        as<font color="#FF0000"><b> "CLOSED"</b></font> but will keep your account 
        information in our database. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, 
        by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid 
        detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, 
        if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will 
        not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third 
        parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, 
        or as required by law.<br>
