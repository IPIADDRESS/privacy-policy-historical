<h2 class="interior_heading">Privacy Policy</h2>

<div class="cols">
<h3 class="interior">General</h3>
<p>
68Articles places great importance in protecting your privacy. This
Privacy Policy is designed to explain the manner in which 68Articles
collects, uses, and discloses the personal information provided by you
as a result of the use of 68Articles's Web Site and the content,
information and services provided through the Web Site by 68Articles.<br>  
</p><h3 class="interior">Users' Consent</h3>BY ACCESSING THIS WEB SITE, THE WEB
SITE LOCATED AT THE URL WWW.68Articles.COM AND/OR ANY OTHER SITE
PROVIDED BY 68Articles (COLLECTIVELY, THE "SITE"), YOU ARE
SIGNIFYING, EXPRESSING AND PROVIDING YOUR CONSENT TO THE INFORMATION
COLLECTION, INFORMATION USAGE, AND OTHER PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN THE
PRIVACY POLICY BELOW. 68Articles reserves the right to change this
policy at any time, without notice, by posting a new privacy policy at
this location. The collection, use and disclosure of your personal
information by 68Articles will be governed by the version of this
Policy in effect at that time. Please check this page periodically for
any changes.&nbsp;Please <a href="http://www.68Articles.com/contact-us/">contact us</a> if you have any questions about our privacy policy.<p></p>

<h3 class="interior">Collection and Use of Information</h3>
<p>
In order for you
to access certain materials or pages (i.e. author signup, tell a
friend, and the like) and to register as a user on this Site, this Site
requires that you provide certain personal information, including, but
not limited to, your name, phone number and e-mail address. We use this
information in order to contact you to provide you with further
information about our company and services, as well as for other
commercial and/or internal purposes such as market research in order to
better understand the demographics of our Site visitors and potential
customers and partners. We may share this information with our
authorized partners and/or with third parties who act for or on behalf
of us, but we do not otherwise provide or sell any information gathered
on this Site to outside vendors.</p>  
<h3 class="interior">User Tracking</h3>
<p>
This Site implements a user tracking
feature, whereby the activities of each unique visitor to the Site are
monitored. This is done regardless of whether the visitor has
registered on the Site or is visiting the Site anonymously. If you do
not register on this Site or fill in your personal details on any
forms, you do remain anonymous and we do not discover your identity. If
you do register on this Site, our use of user tracking enables us to
identify your future and prior activities on the Site, including your
activity before you registered. This includes pages on our Site that
you visited. User tracking also allows us to determine through which
means you have reached our Site (i.e. which search engines or links) up
to one web page back. The purpose of our user tracking is to analyze
our visitors' actions in order to improve the user experience of
visitors to our Site, as well as to better understand the priorities
and interests of our potential customers and partners in order to
better suit their needs and increase the efficiency of our sales and
marketing processes.</p>
<h3 class="interior">Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>
A "cookie" is a small text file
transferred by a Web Site to a computer that is browsing the Web Site.
Even if you do not register on this Site, upon your first visit to this
Site (or subsequent visits if you delete the cookie), a cookie is
stored on your computer, which automatically identifies you to the
Site. This is done for several technical reasons, including enabling
the "User Tracking" described above. In addition, for your convenience,
the cookie can "autofill" information on forms on the Site, precluding
the need for you to fill out the same information on our registration
forms each time you want to access information that requires
registration. However, cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover
the identity of the user; the only personal information we learn about
you is that which you provide to us, as described above. If you would
prefer not to receive cookies, you can change the configuration of your
browser to refuse cookies. In addition, you can delete any cookies that
have already been placed on your computer.</p>  

<h3 class="interior">Internet Protocol Addresses</h3>

<p> We collect the IP
addresses of all visitors to our Site. We use your IP address in order
to administer the Site, help diagnose problems with our server, to
gather broad demographic information, and for the "User Tracking"
described above.</p>  

<h3 class="interior">Hyperlinks</h3>

<p>This Site contains hyperlinks to other
web sites. This privacy policy applies only to this Site and not to any
other sites, including sites accessed by hyperlink from this Site.
68Articles has no responsibility, liability for, or control over
those other web sites or Internet resources or their collection, use
and disclosure of your personal information, nor has it any control
over the privacy policies of any of these sites. When you leave the
ArticleBase Site via one of the links then you should read the privacy
policy, if any, provided by the site that you have visited.</p>  
<p>The applicable law and exclusive jurisdiction for settling any
disputes in connection with the use of the Site shall be the laws and
jurisdiction of the state of Israel according to the provisions of the
then policy in effect.</p>  
<p>68Articles will accumulate and process your personal information
in the USA, Israel or, from time to time, in other locations at its
discretion in order to provide you with competent and effective
service. </p>  
<p>In order to assist in protecting the confidentiality of your
personal information, 68Articles applies security safeguards
appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. However, in light of
the nature of Internet technologies, security and privacy risks cannot
be eliminated and, therefore, 68Articles cannot guarantee that your
personal information will not be disclosed in ways not otherwise
described in this Policy.</p>  

<h3 class="interior">3rd Party Based Advertising</h3>
<ul>  
    <li>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on 68Articles.com.</li>  
    <li>Google's
use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to users based on their
visit to our site and other sites on the Internet.</li>  
    <li>You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>. <br>
