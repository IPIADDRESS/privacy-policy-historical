                    <li>Your privacy and the security of your personal information are important to us.

                    <li>We also use industry-standard encryption (transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology) to protect your data in transit. Encryption keeps your data private while in transit.</li>
                    <li class="nm_top">Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using security safeguards and reasonable measures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of your data.</li>
                    <li>5. How you control the information we receive?</li>
                    <li>You have a right to be informed of personal data processed by SVGator, a right to rectification/correction, erasure, and restriction of processing.

                    <li>To exercise any of the rights mentioned in this Privacy Policy and/or in case of questions you may email us at contact@svgator.com. We will get back to you within 30 days from the date of your email.</li>
                    <li>6. How long we keep your information?</li>
                    <li>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide SVGator to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we remove it from our systems.</li>
                    <li>7. Changing our Privacy Policy</li>
                    <li>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
