These informations are anonymous, we cannot identify you personally ,unless you identify yourself, for example, by making a purchase or by creating an account. Now and then, we may conduct surveys, run contests or other promotions. If you choose to participate in one of our surveys or contests, we'll probably ask for some personal information such as your shopping habits, e-mail address and other information so we can run the promotion and notify winners.
