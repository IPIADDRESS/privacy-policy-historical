<br><br>

<b>Cookies.</b><br>
 Snowboardermag.com, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses "cookies" to enhance your Web viewing experience. A cookie is a piece of data sent from a server to your browser and is served in your computerâ€™s hard drive. Snowboardermag.com's cookies cannot be used to determine any personally identifiable information about you and do not damage your system or files in any way. Here's how it works. When you are first served an advertisement (ad) by Snowboardermag.com, Snowboardermag.com assigns you a unique number and records that number in the cookie file of your computer. Then, when you visit a Web site on which Snowboardermag.com serves ads, Snowboardermag.com reads this number to help target ads to you. The cookie can help ensure that you do not see the same ad over and over again. Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site. This information helps our advertisers cater their ads to your needs.
<br><br>
While we believe that cookies enhance your Web experience by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level of relevant content on the Web, they are not essential for us to continue our leadership position in Web advertising. 
<br><br>
If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature. To find out more about this procedure, please follow these instructions. 
<br><br>
To eliminate cookies you may have currently accepted, and to deny cookies in the future, please follow this procedure:
<br><br>
If you are using Netscape Navigator 3.0, go to the Options Menu, to Network Preferences and then to Protocols. Check the box that says "Show an alert before accepting a cookie." Then go into your Netscape folder (usually c:\program files\netspace\navigator) and delete the file, which is called "cookies.txt." Under Windows 95, you could also use the Find feature on the start menu to simply find the file called Cookies.txt.
<br><br>
In Internet Explorer 3.0, go to the View menu, then to Options, then to Advanced. Check the box that says "Warn before accepting cookies." Then go into your cookies directory (usually c:\windows\cookies) and delete all the files you have there. Once you delete these files, you will have no more cookies, and you will be prompted each time a Web site attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel the cookie.
<br><br>
If you are using Netscape 4.0+, go to "Edit" in the menu bar, click on "Preferences", click on Advanced", and check the box that says "Warn me before accepting a cookie". Now go to your "Start" button, click on "Find", click on "Files and Folders", type "cookies.txt" into the search box that appears, and click "Find Now". When the search results appear, drag all files listed, into the "Recycle Bin". Now shut down and restart your Netscape.
<br><br>
In Internet Explorer 4.0, go to the View menu, then to Internet Options, then to Advanced. Check the box that says "Prompt before accepting cookies." Then go into your cookies directory (usually c:\windows\cookies) and delete all the files you have there. Once you delete these files, you will have no more cookies, and you will be prompted each time a Web site attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel the cookie.
<br><br>
<b>Promotions.</b>
<br>
We may ask you for personally identifiable information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions sponsored by us or a third party.
