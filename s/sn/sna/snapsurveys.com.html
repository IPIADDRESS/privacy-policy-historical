Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it.</p>
<p>Snap Surveys provides products and services which enable our customers to create and administer surveys.

<p>Snap Surveys acts as data controller in relation to  all personal information other than Survey Data. If you are a survey  respondent, the data controller of the Survey Data is our customer who invited  you to participate in the survey. For all other information, your data  controller is Snap Surveys Limited if you are located outside of North or South  America, and Snap Surveys NH, Inc. if you are located within North or South  America.</p>

<h2><a name="resp" id="resp">Privacy policy if you are a survey respondent</a></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Snap Surveys’ products and  services enable our customers to create and administer surveys. We may host our  customers’ surveys on our servers and collect the responses to those surveys on  their behalf. Our customers may also upload contact information of potential  survey respondents to invite them to participate in a survey. We refer to this  contact information and responses as “<strong>Survey  Data</strong>”. Our customers remain data controllers of this Survey Data and we  process it solely in accordance with our agreement with our customers. Aside  from Survey Data, we are likely to process very limited information about you.</p>
<p>Our customers have total  discretion to determine what information they collect, who they invite to  participate in a survey, whether they upload respondent information, what the Survey  Data will be used for, whether it will be combined with other information and  data, who it will be shared with and how long it will be stored. We strongly  recommend you read the privacy notices and/or obtain privacy information from  our customer who has invited you to participate in the survey to fully understand  how your Survey Data will be used.</p>
<p>We offer our customers a range of options as to how  they host their surveys, including on servers managed by us in the UK or the  US. Our customers may also install our products on their own servers in which  case the survey is hosted by our customer and we do not process any Survey Data  relating to that survey. The rest of this policy applies only where we host  surveys on behalf of our customers or otherwise process Survey Data for them  (for example, where we carry out paper surveys for them).</p>
