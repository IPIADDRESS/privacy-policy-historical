<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to improve our website’s performance and your experience of using our website. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see <a title="Cookies used by Snap Surveys" href="http://www.snapsurveys.com/cookies/">‘Cookies used by Snap Surveys’</a>.</p>
<h3>Web Beacons</h3>
<p>We use Web Beacons to help us better manage content on our website by informing us what content is effective. Web Beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Web Beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence. Web Beacons collect information such as cookie identifiers, IP addresses, times and dates of pages being viewed and the URL of the page on which the Web Beacon appears. The data that we collect is aggregated and anonymised and we do not tie the information gathered by Web Beacons on our website to any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>When we send you emails, we may include a Web Beacon to allow us to determine the number of people who open our emails and information such as when and how many times the email was viewed, whether any links were clicked on and whether the email was forwarded. When you click on a link in an email, we may record this individual response to customise our offerings to you. Web Beacons can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive Web Beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML emails via your email software, but please note that this is likely to reduce the functionality of such emails.</p>
<h3>Web-tracking</h3>
