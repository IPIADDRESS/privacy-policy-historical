      HP and its subsidiaries respect your privacy. This Privacy Statement informs you of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online and how that information is used. This statement is readily available on our home page and at the bottom of every HP Web page.

<strong>1. Sites covered by this Privacy Statement</strong><br>
HP is a global organization, with legal entities, business 
            processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross 
            borders. This Privacy Statement applies to all HP-owned websites and 
            domains and the websites and domains of our wholly owned 
            subsidiaries ("HP website"), except that a privacy policy or 
            statement posted on HP websites specific to a particular HP program 
            or service will apply instead of this Privacy Statement. 
			<br><br>
 Links to non-HP websites:
            The HP website may provide links to third-party websites for your 
            convenience and information. If you access those links, you will 
            leave the HP website. HP does not control those sites or their 
            privacy practices, which may differ from HP's practices. We do not 
            endorse or make any representations about third-party websites. The 
            personal data you choose to provide to or that is collected by these 
            third parties is not covered by the HP Privacy Statement. We 
            encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before 
            submitting your personal information.
</p>
<p>
<a name="collection"></a>
<strong>2. Collection of personal information </strong><br>
To serve you better and understand your needs and interests, HP 
            collects, exports, and uses personal information with adequate 
            notice and consent, along with required filings with data protection 
            authorities, when applicable. For example, when you order products 
            or services, apply for instant credit, request information, 
            subscribe to marketing or support materials, register yourself or 
            your HP products, enter contests or participate in surveys, or apply 
            for a job at HP, we will ask you to provide personal information to 
            complete these transactions. The types of personal information you 
            provide to us on these pages may include contact information such as 
            your name, address, telephone number, and email address; financial 
            information such as your credit card number; and other unique 
            information such as user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction 
            information, product and service preferences, contact preferences, 
            educational and employment background, and job interest data. If you 
            apply for instant credit, we will ask you to provide additional 
            sensitive personal information such as salary, Social Security 
            number and banking information. This information will be used by our 
            financial services providers in determining whether to extend you 
            credit.
			<br><br>
If you choose to use a tell-a-friend program on our site, we will 
            ask you for your friend's e-mail address and automatically send your 
            friend a one-time e-mail inviting your friend to visit the site. HP 
            uses and stores this information only for the purpose of sending 
            this one-time e-mail and to provide tell-a-friend message blocking, 
            where available.
<br><br>
In addition to the information you provide, HP may also collect 
            information during your visit to an HP website through our Automatic 
            Data Collection Tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, embedded 
            Web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. 
            These tools collect certain standard information that your browser 
            sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access 
            times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at an 
            HP website. They may also collect information about your Internet 
            Protocol (IP) address, clickstream behavior (i.e. the pages you 
            view, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection 
            with HP websites) and product information. An IP address is a number 
            that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are 
            surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your 
            computer. Computers use IP addresses to communicate on the Internet, 
            allowing users to browse and shop. HP may also use some of these 
            Automatic Data Collection Tools in connection with certain emails 
            sent from HP and therefore may collect information using these tools 
            when you open the email or click on a link contained in the email. 
            To learn more, read How HP uses automatic data collection tools. 
            HP also collects information from commercially available sources 
            that it deems credible. Such information may include your name, 
            address, email address and demographic data. The information HP 
            collects from its commercial sources may be used along with the 
            information HP collects when you visit HP's websites. For example, 
            HP may compare the geographic information acquired from commercial 
            sources with the IP address collected by Automatic Data Collection 
            Tools to derive your general geographic area.

</p>

<p>
<a name="how_we_use"></a>
<strong>3. How we use your information</strong><br>
 The information HP collects to understand your needs and interests 
            helps HP deliver a consistent and personalized experience. For 
            example, HP may use your information to 
              assist you in completing a transaction or order; 
              communicate with you about products and services; 
              provide service and support; 
              update you on new services and benefits; 
              provide personalized promotional offers; 
              select content to be communicated to you; 
              personalize some HP websites; 
              allow you to participate in contests and surveys; and 
              contact you for market research regarding HP products or services. 
			  			  <br><br>
We will give you the opportunity to choose your privacy preferences 
            regarding the communications we send (see Your choices and selecting 
            your privacy preferences).
			<br><br>
 The testimonials posted on our Web site are only posted with the 
            expressed permission of the individual or company who provided that 
            testimonial. 
	<br><br>
	Credit card information is used only for payment processing and 
            fraud prevention. Credit card information and other sensitive 
            personal information required to process a credit decision is not 
            used for any other purpose by our financial services providers or HP 
            and will not be kept longer than necessary for providing the 
            services, unless you ask us to retain your credit card information 
            for future purchases.
</p>			
			
	<p>
<a name="how_we_share"></a>
<strong>4. How we share your information</strong><br>
HP will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others 
            except as described in this Statement. HP shares personal 
            information in the following ways:<br>
            HP retains service providers and suppliers to deliver complete 
            products, services and customer solutions and to assist HP with 
            marketing and communication initiatives. These providers and 
            suppliers include, for example, credit card processors, providers of 
            customer support and live-help, email service providers, automated 
            data processors, and shipping agents. Suppliers and service 
            providers are required by contract to keep confidential the 
            information received on behalf of HP and may not use it for any 
            purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for 
            HP. 
	<br><br>
		From time to time, HP participates in marketing initiatives with 
            other companies. As part of these initiatives, certain HP services 
            and marketing communications are delivered at the same time as those 
            from other companies. Some of these services and communications 
            offer you the option to share personal information with both HP and 
            the other companies participating in these initiatives. For example, 
            you may receive marketing communications from HP and other companies 
            or have the opportunity to register online for software products 
            from multiple companies. If you choose to provide personal 
            information only to HP, HP will not share this information with the 
            other companies participating in that marketing initiative. If you 
            choose to provide personal information to the other companies, that 
            personal information will be handled according to the privacy policy 
            of those companies. 
<br><br>			
	HP will require the export of your personal information to other 
            HP-owned business entities in the US and Worldwide in accordance 
            with this Statement to satisfy your request. Such export is a 
            requirement of providing the information to HP.
<br><br>			
 Except as described in this Statement, HP will not share the 
            personal information you provide to HP with non-HP third parties 
            without your permission, unless to: (i) respond to duly authorized 
            information requests of police and governmental authorities; (ii) 
            comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; (iii) 
            help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights and 
            properties of HP or its subsidiaries; or (iv) protect the personal 
            safety of HP employees and third parties on HP property. 
            Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other 
            business reasons, HP decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise 
            reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may 
            involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or 
            actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is HP's 
            practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these 
            types of transactions.

<strong>5. Children's privacy</strong><br>
HP does not knowingly collect information from children under the 
            age of 13 and does not target its websites to children under 13. We

</p><p><strong>6. Your choices and selecting your privacy preferences</strong><br>
HP gives you the choice of receiving a variety of information that 
            complements our products and services. You can subscribe to receive 
            certain product- and service-specific information and also choose to 
            receive HP general communications. We give you a choice regarding 
            delivery of HP general communications by postal mail, email and 
            telephone.
			<br><br>
			You can make or change your choices about receiving either 
            subscription or general communications at the data collection point 
            or by using other methods, which are listed in the following 
            sections. This option does not apply to communications primarily for 
            the purpose of administering order completion, contracts, support, 
            product safety warnings, driver updates, or other administrative and 
            transactional notices as the primary purpose of these communications 
            is not promotional in nature.
		<br><br>
		The email communications that you receive from HP will be provided 
            in accordance with this statement. Some email communications may 
            utilize automatic data collection tools. To learn more, read How HP 
            uses automatic data collection tools. 
	<br><br>
	Subscription communications:<br>
            Subscription communications include email newsletters, software 
            updates, etc. that may be expressly requested by you or which you 
            consented to receive. After you request such communications, you may 
            opt out of receiving them by using one of the following methods: 
              Select the email "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the 
              opt-out instructions included in each subscription communication. 
              Return to the Web page(s) where you originally registered your 
              preferences and follow the opt-out instructions. Access to many HP 
              subscriptions is available at the Subscriber's Choice web page. 
              Write to the HP Privacy Office. Be sure to provide your name, 
              email and postal address, and specific relevant information about 
              the HP subscriptions that you no longer wish to receive. Please be aware that when you opt out of receiving certain 
            subscription communications, it may affect the services you have 
            chosen to receive from HP where accepting the communications is a 
            condition of receiving the services. 
			  <br><br>
			  HP general communications:<br>
            HP general communications provide information about products, 
            services, and/or support. This may include new product information, 
            special offers, or invitations to participate in market research. 
            You will often be able to use HP Passport to indicate whether you 
            want to receive general communications from HP. HP Passport is a 
            single-login service that lets you register with HP Passport-enabled 
            websites using a single-user identifier and password of your choice. 
            HP Passport uses cookies to store your basic personal information so 
            you don't have to retype it when you return to one of HP's many 
            websites in the future. HP Passport also allows you to set your 
            privacy preferences. Your preferences will apply across HP websites, 
            email, and other communication vehicles that use HP Passport.
			<br><br>
			 If you are unable to use HP Passport, you may opt out of receiving 
            these general communications by using one of the following methods: 
              Select the email "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the 
              opt-out instructions included in each communication. 
              Write to the HP Privacy Office. Be sure to provide your name, 
              email and postal address, and specific relevant information about 
              your privacy preferences.

<strong>7. Access to and accuracy of your information</strong><br>
 HP strives to keep your personal information accurately recorded. We 
            have implemented technology, management processes and policies to 
            help maintain data accuracy. HP provides individuals with reasonable 
            access to personal information that they provided to HP and the 
            reasonable ability to review and correct it or ask for 
            anonymization, blockage, or deletion, as applicable. To protect your 
            privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify 
            your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before 
            granting access to your data. To view and change the personal 
            information that you directly provided to HP you can return to the 
            Web page where you originally submitted your data and follow the 
            instructions on that Web page, use HP Passport where enabled, or 
            contact the HP Privacy Office.

<strong>8. Keeping your personal information secure</strong><br>
 HP takes seriously the trust you place in us. To prevent 
            unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to 
            ensure the appropriate use of the information, HP utilizes 
            appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to 
            safeguard the information we collect.
			<br><br>
	 We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or 
            transferring sensitive information such as credit card information. 
            SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by 
            anyone but us. This security measure is working when you see the 
            symbol of either an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your 
            browser) at the bottom of your browser window.
	<br><br>
	Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments and are 
            not used for other purposes. As part of real-time payment 
            processing, HP subscribes to a fraud management service. This 
            service gives you and HP an extra level of security to guard against 
            credit card fraud and to protect your financial data.

<p><a name="p3p"></a>
<span style="font-weight:500;font-size:14px;">Use of P3P technology: Protecting your privacy</span>
<br><br>
 The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) is a new privacy 
                  technology developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). 
                  P3P technology can be found within your Microsoft Internet 
                  Explorer 6 (IE6) browser and provides you with the ability to 
                  make more informed choices about the use of your personal 
                  information online. Enabling certain areas of our site with 
                  this new technology is another way that HP is on the leading 
                  edge of protecting your privacy. 
                  Microsoft IE6 is the first browser to support the new privacy 
                  standard. With P3P, you can configure your browser to 
                  automatically detect if a website collects personally 
                  identifiable information, uses that information to create user 
                  profiles, or allows visitors to opt-out of the data collection.
<br><br>
A P3P-enabled browser has preset options from which you can 
                  choose. Or you may customize your setting by answering 
                  questions such as, what kinds of data are you willing to share 
                  and what types of "cookie" files are you willing to accept. As 
                  you surf the Web, the software then determines whether your 
                  privacy preferences match a site's data collection practices.
                  The P3P-enabled browser places special emphasis on cookies. A 
                  cookie is a piece of text which resides on your computer's 
                  hard drive to allow a Web application to respond to you as an 
                  individual. By gathering and remembering information about 
                  your preferences, the Web application can tailor its operation 
                  to your needs, likes and dislikes. With a P3P-enabled browser, 
                  you may be able to make selections based on whether you wish 
                  to accept various types of cookies such as session 
                  (temporary), permanent, within a given domain or outside it 
                  (third party), and with or without a special "P3P compact 
                  policy" file. A compact P3P policy describes the attributes of 
                  a given cookie.

<span style="font-weight:500;font-size:14px;">How HP uses automatic data collection tools</span>
<br><br>
The following sections provide additional information about commonly-used web technology tools.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>

                  A "cookie" is a small data file transferred by a website to 
                  your computer's hard drive. HP or its service providers send 
                  cookies when you surf our site or sites where our ads appear, 
                  make purchases, request or personalize information, or 
                  register yourself for certain services.  Accepting the cookies 
                  used on our site or sites where our ads appear may give us 
                  access to information about your browsing behavior, which we 
                  may use to personalize your experience. Cookies are typically 
                  classified as either "session" cookies or "persistent"
cookies.
<br><br>
Session cookies do not stay on your computer after you close your browser.<br>
Persistent cookies remain on your computer until you delete 
                    them or they expire. Most browsers automatically accept 
                    cookies by default, but you can usually refuse cookies or 
                    selectively accept cookies by adjusting the preferences in 
                    your browser. If you turn off cookies, there may be some 
                    features of our site that will not be available to you and 
                    some Web pages may not display properly. 
				<br><br>
				You can find information on popular browsers and how to adjust 
                  your cookie preferences at the following websites: <br>
                    Microsoft Internet Explorer: <br>
                    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm</a><br><br>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Web beacons</strong><br>
 Some HP.com and third-party Web pages and HTML-formatted email 
                  use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to 
                  compile information about your website usage and your 
                  interaction with email. A Web beacon is an electronic image, 
                  called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can 
                  recognize certain types of information on your computer such 
                  as cookies, the time and date of a page viewed, and a 
                  description of the page where the Web beacon is placed.  
                  You may be able to disable Web beacons in email messages by 
                  not downloading images contained in the message you receive 
                  (this feature varies depending on the email software used on 
                  your personal computer). However, doing this may not always 
                  disable a Web beacon or other automatic data collection tools 
                  in the email message due to specific email software 
                  capabilities. For more information about this, please refer to 
                  the information provided by your email software or service 
                  provider.
<br><br>
If you choose to receive marketing emails or newsletters from 
                  HP as specified in Your choices and selecting your privacy 
                  preferences, HP may automatically collect personal information 
                  about you. For example, through Web beacons and personalized 
                  URLs embedded in these emails or newsletters, HP can track 
                  whether you've opened those messages and whether you've 
                  clicked on links contained within those messages. For more 
                  information on embedded Web links, see below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Embedded Web links</strong><br>
Emails from HP, Internet keyboard keys preconfigured by HP, 
                  and promotional icons preinstalled on your PC desktop often 
                  use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the Web, 
                  after redirection through HP's servers. The redirection system 
                  allows HP to change the destination URL of these links, if 
                  necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our marketing 
                  initiatives.
	<br><br>
	In emails, such web links may also allow HP to determine 
                  whether you have clicked a link in an email, and this 
                  information about the interaction may be connected to your 
                  personal identity. If you do not want HP to collect 
                  information about the links that you click, you can:<br>
				 change your choice about how you receive communications from 
                    HP (i.e. choose a text-based version of the message where 
                    available) or choose not to click links in an email that HP 
                    sends 
                    delete the promotional icons preinstalled by HP on your PC 
                    desktop or choose not to click on those 
                    reconfigure the Internet keyboard keys on certain PC models 
                    to launch a destination URL of your choice by using the 
                    instructions provided with your PC <br>
					<br><br>
					<strong>HP ads on third-party websites</strong><br>
					HP contracts with service providers to place ads on websites 
                  owned by third parties. The service providers send cookies 
                  from and use Web beacons on these third-party websites. The 
                  cookies and Web beacons may enable HP to collect information 
                  about the pages you viewed and the links you clicked. 
<br><br>
<strong>Information-gathering tools</strong><br>
                  HP may use tools to collect information about your experience 
                  on some HP websites. These tools do not involve the use of Web 
                  beacons or cookies, but record your interaction with an HP 
                  website as captured by an HP server. Certain tools, used in 
                  some countries, may enable HP to replay customer web sessions. 
                  These tools are used primarily for troubleshooting purposes; 
                  information collected by these tools will be stored for a 
                  limited period of time.
