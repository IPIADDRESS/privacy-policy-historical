        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: May 1, 2014</p>
        <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Snapchat, Inc. and our subsidiaries (collectively, "Snapchat") when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.
        </p>
        <p>
        We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites' homepages or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
        </p>
        <h2>Collection of Information</h2>
        <h3 class="no-margin-top">Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <p>
       We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, use the Services to send or receive messages, including photos or videos taken via our Services ("Snaps‚Äù) and content sent via the chat screen ("Chats"), request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your username, password, email address, phone number, age and any other information you choose to provide. 
        </p>
        <p>
        When you send or receive messages, we also temporarily collect, process and store the contents of those messages (such as photos, videos, captions and/or Chats) on our servers. The contents of those messages are also temporarily stored on the devices of recipients. Once all recipients have viewed a Snap, we automatically delete the Snap from our servers and our Services are programmed to delete the Snap from the Snapchat app on the recipients' devices. Similarly, our Services are programmed to automatically delete a Chat after you and the recipient have seen it and swiped out of the chat screen, unless either one of you taps to save it. Please note that users with access to the Replay feature are able to view a Snap additional times before it is deleted from their device and if you add a Snap to your Story it will be viewable for 24 hours. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that deletion of any message always occurs within a particular timeframe. We also cannot prevent others from making copies of your messages (e.g., by taking a screenshot). If we are able to detect that the recipient has captured a screenshot of a Snap that you send, we will attempt to notify you. In addition, as for any other digital information, there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients' devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted. You should not use Snapchat to send messages if you want to be certain that the recipient cannot keep a copy.
        </p>
        <h3>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services</h3>
        <p>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:</p>

                  <li>When you use Find Friends to add your friends, your username will be shared with other users who use Find Friends and have your phone number in their device phonebook.

        </p>
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <h3>Privacy Settings</h3>
        <p>
        Through settings in our Services, you can choose whether to accept Snaps only from users you have added to your friends list, or from any other Snapchat user who determines your username. If you choose to receive Snaps only from your friends, and a user who is not on your friends list attempts to send you a Snap or add you as a friend, you will receive a notification and have the option of adding the user to your friends list. You can also change who can view your Stories in the settings feature of our Services.
        </p>
	<p>
        You also have the ability to delete users from your friends list or to block specific users at any time by using controls within our Services.
        </p><p></p>
        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <p>
        You may update or correct information about yourself by editing your account settings within our Services. If you wish to delete your account, please visit <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/delete-account">https://support.snapchat.com/delete-account</a>, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law, for legitimate business purposes, or as part of our regular retention practices. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain period of time.
        </p>
        <h3>Device Information</h3>
        <p>
        Certain features of the Services require access to your device's native phonebook and image storage applications (e.g., to find friends, to send a photo from your photo gallery via a Chat, or to store a Snap in your photo gallery). If you choose to find friends, the names and phone numbers in your device's native phonebook will be transmitted to Snapchat. If you later decide to revoke your consent and prevent us from continuing to access your phonebook and image storage applications, you can do so by either changing the settings on your device, if this settings option is provided by your device operating system, or by following the standard uninstall process and removing our Services from your device. On iOS devices, you can grant or revoke your consent at any time and prevent us from continuing to access your phonebook and image storage applications by changing the settings on your device.
        </p>
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>
	When you first launch any features of our Services that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to our collection of this information. If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by changing the preferences on your mobile device. If you do so, certain features of our Services will no longer function. You may also stop our collection of location information by following the standard uninstall process to remove our Services from your device.
        </p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
        Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our website.
        </p>
        <h3>Push Notifications/Alerts</h3>
        <p>
        Snapchat may send push notifications or alerts to your device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your device (iOS) or by changing your settings within our Services (Android).
