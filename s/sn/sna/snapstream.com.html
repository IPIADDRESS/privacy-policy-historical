            <p>              Thank you for visiting the home of SnapStream Media.</p>
            <p class="ParagraphTitle">Overarching Commitment</p>
              <p>SnapStream Media is committed to respecting your privacy. We
                will never send you e-mail without your consent. Anyone who receives
                an e-mail from SnapStream can contact us to remove his or her
                e-mail address from any or all of our mailing lists. That can
                be done in person or by phone (713.644.6240), fax (713.644.3215),
                e-mail (<a href="mailto:privacy@snapstream.com">privacy@snapstream.com</a>) or snail mail (6730 Long Drive,
                Houston, Texas 77087, USA). To update or correct any information
                we have about you, contact us in any of the ways listed above.</p>
              <p>We keep your information secure against loss, misuse or alteration
                by using industry-standard security practices, including restricted
                access to the data, physically securing the servers storing the
                data and through regular backups of the database. We own the
                servers that host our Web site, and they are kept in a high-security
                co-location facility.</p>
              <p>We welcome compliments, criticism, advice and parodies from
                our users and visitors on anything we do: the site, the forums,
                all our products and our business in general. Please, let us
                know what you think!</p>
              <p class="ParagraphTitle">Privacy Policy</p>
              <p>When you visit our site, the server automatically documents
                what pages you visit and for how long, where you linked from,
                your IP address and other technical statistics, none of which
                is used to identify you as an individual user. We collect that
                data to learn where our site visitors come from, what site features
                they use most and other similar development- and maintenance-related
                information so that we can improve service. We may share aggregated
                or depersonalized information with business partners, advertisers
                and others, but we will not deliver personally identifiable information
                to third parties without your specific prior approval.</p>
              <p>Any information we gather about visitors to our site is kept
                securely for our use only. We do not sell or share with anyone
                outside of SnapStream Media information we have about any individual
                users without getting their permission first.</p>
              <p>We reserve the right to release any information within our records,
                if refusing to do so would place SnapStream Media in violation
                of laws that apply to us. We also reserve the right to keep confidential
                information within our records if releasing that information
                could place SnapStream Media in violation of applicable laws.</p>
              <p>Before downloading the lite version of SnapStream Beyond TV, we ask visitors to enter a name, e-mail address
                and company, so that we may keep them informed of news and updates
                related to the product. We also ask for that information because
                we're curious about the people downloading the program. Entering
                the information is optional. Those who enter a valid e-mail address
                may receive updates when we release a new version of the software,
                other Beyond TV-related
                alerts or invitations to subscribe to any other e-mail lists
                the company maintains.</p>
              <p>During the process of order processing (for any purchases made
                in the SnapStream Online Store) we collect your name,
                billing
                address, credit
                card number and other standard information required for payment
                and delivery. Please
                refer to the Yahoo Store privacy policy at http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/.
                We may use the information  gathered in the course of order processing
                to notify you of updates related to SnapStream Media.</p>
              <p class="ParagraphTitle">SnapStream.Net</p>
              <p>In order to provide you with a custom program guide that is
                accessible worldwide, SnapStream.Net maintains a central database
                that contains your personal information. This information includes
                your Email Address, Zip Code, Channel Lineup, Saved Searches
                and Remote Recording Jobs. We will use your email address to
                communicate with you about the status of your account. Additionally,
                it will be the login ID that you can use to access the service.
                Other than to provide you with guide data, the information about
                your lineup, searches and remote recordings will only be used
                in aggregate for us to profile our service and provide our customers
                a better experience using the service. Personally identifiable
                information will never be sold, rented or otherwise distributed
              to any third-party.</p>
              <p class="ParagraphTitle">The Discussion Forum</p>
              <p>SnapStream Media uses vbulletin to manage our
                discussion forums. When you enter the discussion area, you may
                opt to register as a member of the forum. Information you enter
                into your user profile is visible to other members of the community,
                so use care in completing these forms. (If a blank does not specifically
                state that the information you enter there will be kept private,
                then it probably won't be. If it does specify that the information
                is private, we'll keep it that way.)</p>
              <p>In general, users should know that the contents of any messages
                they post in the forum are accessible to the public. Be careful
                about posting personally identifiable information in any public
                place on the Internet. Doing so makes it impossible for us to
                protect your privacy.</p>
              <p class="ParagraphTitle">Cookies</p>
              <p>We do not use cookies on www.snapstream.com at this
                time.</p>
              <p>Cookies are used, though in a limited fashion, to make it more
                convenient for users to log into the SnapStream.Net web site
                (located at www.snapstream.net).</p>
              <p class="ParagraphTitle">Conclusion</p>
              <p>All users should recognize that we'll do what's reasonably required
                to keep your private information private, but the nature of Internet
                communication prevents us from being able to guarantee that communication
                between you and our company will be free from unauthorized access
                by others. Again, we'll do our best, but we won't promise the
                impossible.</p>
              <p>Any changes we make to this policy will be posted on this page
                and will be effective when posted. If a policy change affects
                how we'll treat the information we have stored about visitors
                who came before the change, we will do our best to notify those
                visitors.</p>
              <p>Any link to sites outside of SnapStream Media will bring you
                to places that are not guided by our privacy policy. Surfers
                should check those sites' policies, if they exist, for more information.</p>
              <p>Again, if you have any questions or comments, please contact
                us at <a href="mailto:privacy@snapstream.com">privacy@snapstream.com</a>. <br>
