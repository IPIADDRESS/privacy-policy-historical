<p class="PageTitle">Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting the home of SnapStream Media.</p>
<p class="ParagraphTitle">Overarching Commitment</p>
<p>SnapStream Media is committed to respecting your privacy. We will never send you e-mail without your consent. Anyone who receives an e-mail from SnapStream can contact us to remove his or her e-mail address from any or all of our mailing lists. That can be done in person or by phone
(713.644.6240), fax (713.644.3215), e-mail (<a href="mailto:privacy@snapstream.com">privacy@snapstream.com</a>) or snail mail (6730 Long Drive, Houston, Texas 77087, USA). To update or correct any information we have about you, contact us in any of the ways listed above.</p>
<p>We keep your information secure against loss, misuse or alteration by using industry-standard security practices, including restricted access to the data, physically securing the servers storing the data and through regular backups of the database. We own the servers that host our Web site, and
they are kept in a high-security co-location facility.</p>
<p>We welcome compliments, criticism, advice and parodies from our users and visitors on anything we do: the site, the forums, all our products and our business in general. Please, let us know what you think!</p>
<p class="ParagraphTitle">Privacy Policy</p>
<p>When you visit our site, the server automatically documents what pages you visit and for how long, where you linked from, your IP address and other technical statistics, none of which is used to identify you as an individual user. We collect that data to learn where our site visitors come from,
what site features they use most and other similar development- and maintenance-related information so that we can improve service. We may share aggregated or depersonalized information with business partners, advertisers and others, but we will not deliver personally identifiable information to
third parties without your specific prior approval.</p>
<p>Any information we gather about visitors to our site is kept securely for our use only. We do not sell or share with anyone outside of SnapStream Media information we have about any individual users without getting their permission first.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to release any information within our records, if refusing to do so would place SnapStream Media in violation of laws that apply to us. We also reserve the right to keep confidential information within our records if releasing that information could place SnapStream Media in
violation of applicable laws.</p>
<p>Before downloading the lite version of SnapStream Beyond TV, we ask visitors to enter a name, e-mail address and company, so that we may keep them informed of news and updates related to the product. We also ask for that information because we're curious about the people downloading the
program. Entering the information is optional. Those who enter a valid e-mail address may receive updates when we release a new version of the software, other Beyond TV-related alerts or invitations to subscribe to any other e-mail lists the company maintains.</p>
<p>During the process of order processing (for any purchases made in the SnapStream Online Store) we collect your name, billing address, credit card number and other standard information required for payment and delivery. Please refer to the Yahoo Store privacy policy at
http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/. We may use the information gathered in the course of order processing to notify you of updates related to SnapStream Media.</p>
<p class="ParagraphTitle">SnapStream.Net</p>
<p>In order to provide you with a custom program guide that is accessible worldwide, SnapStream.Net maintains a central database that contains your personal information. This information includes your Email Address, Zip Code, Channel Lineup, Saved Searches and Remote Recording Jobs. We will use
your email address to communicate with you about the status of your account. Additionally, it will be the login ID that you can use to access the service. Other than to provide you with guide data, the information about your lineup, searches and remote recordings will only be used in aggregate for
us to profile our service and provide our customers a better experience using the service. Personally identifiable information will never be sold, rented or otherwise distributed to any third-party.</p>
<p class="ParagraphTitle">The Discussion Forum</p>
<p>SnapStream Media uses vbulletin to manage our discussion forums. When you enter the discussion area, you may opt to register as a member of the forum. Information you enter into your user profile is visible to other members of the community, so use care in completing these forms. (If a blank
does not specifically state that the information you enter there will be kept private, then it probably won't be. If it does specify that the information is private, we'll keep it that way.)</p>
<p>In general, users should know that the contents of any messages they post in the forum are accessible to the public. Be careful about posting personally identifiable information in any public place on the Internet. Doing so makes it impossible for us to protect your privacy.</p>
<p class="ParagraphTitle">Cookies</p>
<p>We do not use cookies on www.snapstream.com at this time.</p>
<p>Cookies are used, though in a limited fashion, to make it more convenient for users to log into the SnapStream.Net web site (located at www.snapstream.net).</p>
<p class="ParagraphTitle">Conclusion</p>
<p>All users should recognize that we'll do what's reasonably required to keep your private information private, but the nature of Internet communication prevents us from being able to guarantee that communication between you and our company will be free from unauthorized access by others.
Again, we'll do our best, but we won't promise the impossible.</p>
<p>Any changes we make to this policy will be posted on this page and will be effective when posted. If a policy change affects how we'll treat the information we have stored about visitors who came before the change, we will do our best to notify those visitors.</p>
<p>Any link to sites outside of SnapStream Media will bring you to places that are not guided by our privacy policy. Surfers should check those sites' policies, if they exist, for more information.</p>
<p>Again, if you have any questions or comments, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@snapstream.com">privacy@snapstream.com</a>.<br></p>
