        <h3><a href="#goBack" class="goTo" name="title1">What Information Do We Gather?</a></h3>

        <p>When you visit our Sites, we track information including the domain name and the name of the web page from
            which you entered our Sites, and how much time you spend on each of our pages. We also collect information
            that is combined with other web visitors' information, such as how many times visitors click on each web
            page and the methods by which our Sites were found. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your
            computer when you are using your browser on the Internet. We may collect IP addresses and website usage
            information from you when you visit our Sites via the use of "cookies."</p>

        <p>Cookies: A cookie is a small file that is stored on the hard drive of your computer ready for future access
            when you return to our Sites. We use cookies to deliver web content specific to you and to keep track of
            your online order activity. Cookies cannot pass viruses, harm your computer or pass on private information
            such as an email address without the computer user's intervention. Cookies contain session identification
            numbers that allow our systems to recall previous sessions for authentication efforts and assemble
            information from our gathered data. You can configure your computer's browser to alert you when a site is
            attempting to send you a cookie and allow you to accept or refuse the cookie. In addition to cookies, we may
            use small bits of computer code called "one-pixel GIFs," "clear GIFs," or "web beacons" embedded in web
            pages to monitor website activity. We use this collected electronic data to better design our Sites. We also
            collect statistical data on how our apps are used and the banners, widgets and websites created with our
            apps. Additionally, we track information on all banners that run through Bannersnack Ad Campaigns.</p>

        <h3><a href="#goBack" class="goTo" name="title2">What Do We Do With the Information We Collect?</a></h3>

        <p>We reserve the right to use the data collected on our apps, websites, widgets (flipping books, playlists,
            presentations etc), content added in widgets (text, images, etc), rotators and banners (including those that
            run through Bannersnack Ad Campaigns) for commercial purposes. You may be asked to provide personal
            information in certain fields on our Sites. The personal information we collect is used only for the purpose
            we state at the time of collection.</p>

        <p>The Sites does not collect personally identifiable information when you browse the Sites and request pages
            from our servers unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide such information to us. This means that we
            will not know your name, your email address, or any other personally identifiable information just because
            you browse the Sites unless you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>access the Sites from a link in an email that we have sent to you;</li>
            <li>have created a profile and you either log-in to your account or choose to be remembered via your cookie,
                including on your web-enabled mobile device.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In these cases we will know who you are based on the information you previously supplied to us. When you
            request a page from our Sites, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header including
            the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information that is provided in
            the HTTP header. We collect the HTTP request header information in order to make our Sites function
            correctly and provide you the functionality that you expect to see. We also use this information to
            personalize content presented to you, better understand how visitors use our Sites and how we can better
            tune it, its contents, and functionality to meet your needs.</p>

        <p>You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. You can set your Internet browser so that it will
            not allow cookies to be stored on your device. This may reduce functionality of SnackTools network sites and
            may mean that certain features or content will not be available to you. Further information on how to
            prevent cookies from being stored on your device can be found on <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>

        <p><strong><i>Business Transfers</i></strong></p>

        <p>While we do not anticipate it, every business nowadays should plan for the possibility that it might sell
            certain or all of its assets to another company or individual, or that it might buy certain assets of
            another company or individual. If all or part of the company is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to
            another entity, the personal information you have provided to us may be transferred as part of that
            transaction. However, we will take steps to ensure that your personal information is used in a manner
            consistent with the provisions of our Policy.</p>

        <p>Other than those who act on our behalf and except as explained in this Policy, information you provide at
