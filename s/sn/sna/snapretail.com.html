            </p><ul>
                <li><strong>Affiliated Businesses, Vendors and Partners:</strong>  We may share information with affiliated businesses, such as SnapRetail Affiliates and our Partners from whom, or with whose assistance, you purchase products or otherwise interact. This allows them to better serve you.

                <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers: </strong>

We may provide such service providers with access to personal information as needed to perform these functions.
               <br><br></li>
                
                 <li><strong>Offers and Promotions:</strong>

                <li><strong>Market Research:</strong> 
                We may aggregate website visitor information for market research purposes. For example, we may use this information to identify the fastest-selling products in the Southwest. We may share the results of this analysis with our partners, however, your personally identifiable information will not be revealed, other than as described in this policy.
                <br><br></li>

                 <li><strong>Compliance with Laws: </strong>
            We may release personal information when we believe such release is appropriate to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of SnapRetail, our affiliated businesses, or others. This may include, for example, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction
                
                <br><br></li>
                
                 <li><strong>With Your Consent: </strong>
               Other than as set forth above, you will receive notice when your personal information may be provided to third parties, and you will have the opportunity not to share the information.
                </li>
