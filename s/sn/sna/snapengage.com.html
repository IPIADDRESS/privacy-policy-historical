<li><strong>FOR RESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND SWITZERLAND ONLY.</strong>&nbsp;If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, this Section 10 will apply to you.<br>
SnapEngage complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries (and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. SnapEngage has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to <a href="http://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnWQAA0&amp;status=Active" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view our certification page</a>, please visit <a href="http://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.<p></p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, SnapEngage is subject to the regulatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.<br>
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EU and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also may correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under Privacy Shield, should direct their query to support@snapengage.com. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to support@snapengage.com .</p>
<p>In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>SnapEngage’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, SnapEngage remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless SnapEngage proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, SnapEngage&nbsp;commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.
