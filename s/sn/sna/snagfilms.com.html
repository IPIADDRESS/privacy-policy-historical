<b>Effective
Date</b>:&nbsp; October 15, 2015&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
















Thank
you for visiting SnagFilms. Your privacy is important to us and we know that
you care about how we protect your information. This Policy covers information SnagFilms
collects when you use our service, as well the nature of our relationships with
certain third parties that provide services in connection with SnagFilms. We
invite you to review this Policy explaining how your information is collected,
used and shared by SnagFilms.<br><br>

SnagFilms
provides a video service offering a selection of videos and other content
(collectively, “Content”) available on the SnagFilms.com &nbsp;website including any mobile versions thereof (the
“SnagFilms Site” or “Site”), SnagFilms’s applications on mobile and connected-television
devices, smart televisions, and gaming consoles (collectively, “Apps”), and SnagFilms’s
affiliates and other websites where users may embed the Content (“Distribution
Sites”) (collectively, the “Sites”). Our video service, including the Content,
video player, and any other features, tools, applications, materials or other
services offered from time to time by SnagFilms in connection with its business
on any of the Sites are referred to collectively as the “SnagFilms Services” or
“Services.”<br><br>

Some
Sites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not
operated or maintained by us. SnagFilms is not responsible for the privacy
practices of the websites or platforms operated by third parties. If you are
using the SnagFilms Services on another website or platform, you should check
the privacy policy of the other website or platform to determine how it handles
any information it collects from you.<br><br>

By
visiting the SnagFilms Site or Apps (whether or not you are a registered user)
or using any of the SnagFilms Services on any of the Sites, you are accepting
this Privacy Policy. If you do not want information about you to be used in the
manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the SnagFilms Services.<br><br>

<b>I.&nbsp;

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information
collected via cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies.<br><br>

To
enhance your experience, many of our web pages use “<b>cookies</b>.” Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s
browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your
email address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to
provide this information to us by, for example, registering at the SnagFilms Site
or logging in through one of our third-party partner social networking sites.
However, once you choose to furnish the Site with personally identifiable
information, that information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
We use cookies to understand Site usage and to improve the content and
offerings on our Sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your
experience at our web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to
our Site) or save your password in password-protected areas.<br><br>

“<b>Web beacons</b>” or clear .gifs are small
pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data
about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to
count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a
visitor viewing that page. We and third parties may use web beacons on the Site
from time to time for this and other purposes.<br><br>

Information
we may collect from other sources:<br><br>

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facebook
and Twitter ID;<br><br>

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; non-personally
identifiable demographic data collected by Google Analytics (such as age range,
gender and interests); <br><br>

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; advertisement
interaction and viewing data; <br><br>

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unique
identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify
physical location of such devices in accordance with applicable law; and &nbsp;<br><br>

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information
from other commercially available sources, such as data aggregators, public
databases, online marketing firms, ad targeting firms, or our business
partners, which may include your age, gender, interests, purchasing behavior
and your online activities, such as websites visited and advertisements viewed.<br><br>

We
may combine all of the information we collect about you and use it individually
or collectively in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

<b>II.&nbsp;
INFORMATION COLLECTED BY OTHERS</b><br><br>

Some
of our pages contain links to other sites whose information practices may be
different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy notices.
Please be aware that SnagFilms does not warn you when you have chosen to link
through to another website from the SnagFilms Site or Apps.<br><br>

SnagFilms
sometimes may offer content that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified
third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain
personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to
participate in the Site activity. We have no control over use of this
information by these third parties.<br><br>

SnagFilms
may use a reputable third party to present or serve advertisements that you may
see. These third-party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, or similar
technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and
research the effectiveness of such advertisements. These companies may use
aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or
telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to
provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. The use of such
technologies by these third-party ad servers is subject to their own privacy
policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. If you would like more
information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this
information used by these companies, please see:&nbsp;<a href="https://choice.live.com/AdvertisementsChoice/">https://choice.live.com/AdvertisementsChoice/</a>.
Or for information on opting-out entirely, please see:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>

Our
distribution platforms (such as Microsoft) also may collect such personal
information for their use in interest-based advertising.&nbsp;You can see
Microsoft’s privacy policy at <a href="http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/AdDisplay.mspx">http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/AdDisplay.mspx</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>

<b>III.&nbsp;
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT </b><br><br>

We
may use the information we collect in order to establish and enhance our
relationship with you and to improve the user experience we provide.<br><br>

SnagFilms’s
use of this information includes the following general purposes: customizing
the Content and advertising, if any, you view; responding to your inquiries
about our offerings; fulfilling your requests for products, programs or
services; offering products, programs or services we believe may be of interest
to you; identifying the comments you post when you use the SnagFilms Services;
improving our Services; conducting research; compiling aggregate data for
internal and external business purposes; protecting our rights and other uses
in accordance with our Terms of Use; and for any other purpose disclosed to you
at the time we collect your information.<br><br>

<b><u>To Customize the Advertising
You View</u></b>.<br><br>

SnagFilms
may display targeted advertisements based on your personal information (for
example, demographic data or information about your online activities collected
through cookies, web beacons, and other sources). Third-party advertisers and
platforms also may serve targeted ads on the Sites. For more information,
please see Section II. Please remember that this Privacy Policy does not cover
the information practices of third-party advertisers or platforms collecting
data on our Sites.<br><br>

<b><u>To Communicate With
You</u></b>.<b><u>&nbsp; </u></b><br><br>

We
sometimes use your information to communicate with you, such as to notify you
when we make changes to the SnagFilms Site or to fulfill a request by you to
receive our newsletter(s).&nbsp;We may also use your information to provide you
with promotional information about SnagFilms’s features, services, and other
offerings that may be of interest to you, or to provide information or offers
to you that are related to the SnagFilms Services on behalf of our business
partners.&nbsp;<br><br>

<b><u>To Improve Our
Services</u></b>. <br><br>

While
using the SnagFilms Sites you will have the opportunity to comment on Content (“User
Content”). If you choose to submit User Content for publication, we may publish
your name and other information you have provided to us, such as your photo.
Please understand that when you post such User Content, it is made public and
is not subject to this Policy.&nbsp;If you remove User Content, copies may
remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or
stored your User Content.&nbsp;<br><br>

<b><u>To Analyze Data</u></b>.
<b><u>&nbsp;</u></b><br><br>

We
sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to
improve the design and content of our Site and Apps and to enable us to
personalize your experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate
to analyze Site and Apps usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or
services.<br><br>

We
may use anonymous data for purposes of research or analysis. Anonymous data is
information (whether it was originally personally identifiable or
non-personally identifiable) that subsequently is used in aggregate form. We
may conduct research on our customer demographics, internet usage, and
interests and behavior based on personal data we gather. Although anonymous
data may be based in part on such personal data, it does not identify you personally.
SnagFilms may share this type of anonymous data with a variety of third
parties, including its affiliates, advertisers and other current and
prospective business partners.<br><br>

We
also may use anonymous data for website administration, advertising and
promotional purposes, and we may share such information with various affiliated
and unaffiliated entities for such purposes. IP addresses also are used to
provide anonymous aggregated data to advertisers about the volume of use on the
SnagFilms Services. Anonymous usage and demographic information also may be
shared with our advertisers and business partners.<br><br>

SnagFilms has implemented Google Analytics. We use the data collected by
Google Analytics to better understand who our users are. SnagFilms will not
facilitate the merging of your personally identifiable information with the
non-personally identifiable information collected from this feature. <br><br>

Finally,
SnagFilms stores information about which videos you view. This information may
be used to determine Site usage patterns.<br><br>

<b><u>To Enforce Our Rights</u></b>.<br><br>

We
may use the information that we collect to prevent illegal activities, to
enforce our Terms of Use, and to otherwise protect our rights and the rights of
our users. <br><br>

By
using the Services, you consent to the uses identified above and any other use
of information identified in this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may use the
information that we collect for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time
we collect your information or pursuant to your consent. We will not use or
transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated
to the ones described in this Privacy Policy without also providing you with
prior notice. &nbsp;<br><br>

<b>IV.&nbsp; HOW WE SHARE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT WITH
THIRD PARTIES</b><br><br>

We
value your privacy, and we share information about our users only under certain
circumstances. We may make information about you available to other companies,
applications, or people in the circumstances listed below. <br><br>

<b><u>For Legal Purposes</u></b>.
<br><br>

We
may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process,
for example in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose
such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or where we
believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to
the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, to verify or enforce
compliance with the policies governing our Services and applicable laws, or as
otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements.<br><br>

<b><u>If We Sell Our
Business</u></b>. <br><br>

As
we develop our business, we have the right to buy or sell assets or business
offerings.&nbsp;Customer, email and visitor information is generally one of the
transferred business assets in these types of transactions.&nbsp;Accordingly,
we may transfer personally identifiable information about you if we, or one of
our business units, are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.<br><br>

<b><u>With Our Agents and
Contractors</u></b>. <br><br>

We
may disclose personally identifiable information to our agents and contractors;
however, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent
with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any
purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.<br><br>

<b><u>Aggregated
Information</u></b>.&nbsp;
<br><br>

We
may share aggregated information or information that does not directly identify
you with third parties to help us develop content, services, and advertising
that we hope you will find of interest.&nbsp; <br><br>

<b><u>Public Activities on
Site</u></b>.&nbsp; <br><br>

If
you choose to engage in public activities on the site, such as posting
comments, any information you submit can be read, collected, or used by others.
Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in
public activities or submissions.<u> &nbsp;&nbsp;</u><br><br>

Once
we share your information with another party, the information received by that
party becomes subject to the other party’s privacy policies. Please note that
third parties may independently collect data about you, including your IP
address and information about the websites you visit and the links you click,
through cookies, clicks on links, or other means when you visit or view ads on
the Sites. <br><br>

Please
also note that we do not consider any companies that are within our “family” of
companies to be “third parties” for purposes of this Policy. Thus, we also may
share information provided with SnagFilms affiliates. Any of these companies
may use and further share this information in the same ways we do. However, if
we pass on personal information to an affiliate, we require that it protect
such information in a manner that’s consistent with this Policy. <br><br>

<b>V.&nbsp;
HOW WE WORK WITH THIRD-PARTY SOCIAL NETWORKS </b><br><br>

To
customize your experience on the Site and Apps and to simplify our registration
process, we may provide you with the opportunity to access or interact with
third-party social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. When you connect to
the Site and Apps through such third-party services, we may share information
about you with them and they may share data about you with us, including as
follows:<br><br>

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
you connect with a third-party service, you may be able to publish information
about some of your activities on the SnagFilms Services, such as the videos you
watch, to that service. Please note that when you choose to publish your
information from SnagFilms to social networking services, that information will
be visible to users of those services, in accordance with applicable law and
the privacy policies of those services. <br><br>

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
you visit SnagFilms while logged into one of these services, the third-party
service may be able to identify you and to associate the technical information
provided by your web browser with other information the service already has
about you.<br><br>

Please
remember that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party
services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all third-party
service providers.<br><br>

<b>VI.&nbsp;
HOW YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR INFORMATION</b><br><br>

At
certain parts of the SnagFilms Site, only persons who provide us with the
requested personally identifiable information will be able to order services or
otherwise participate in the relevant activities and offerings.<br><br>

If
you have a SnagFilms user Account, you may be able to: <br><br>

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edit
your Account information, such as first and last names (optional), email
address, password, “favorites” and (videos viewed) history.<br><br>

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deactivate
your SnagFilms Account at any time. When you deactivate your Account, we’ll close
it.&nbsp;However, some information, such as your User Content, will remain
visible on the Site and Apps. We may retain archived copies of your information
as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help
address instances of fraud and/or spam).<br><br>

You
may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to
access SnagFilms. For example, your
mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or
other data is shared with us. To learn more about these
choices, please see the information provided by your device or software
provider.<br><br>

You may be able to opt out of Google Analytics, including the Display
Advertising feature Demographics and Interest Reporting. For information on
opting-out of this feature and customizing Google Display Network ads, please
see <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">https://www.google.com/settings/ads</a>.&nbsp; <br><br>

<b>VII.&nbsp;
“DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS</b><br>
<br>
Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to the websites and other
online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that

OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY</b><br><br>

We
believe we have in place the appropriate physical and technical procedures to
safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and
correctly use the information we collect online.<br><br>

no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot
guarantee the security of your personal information and cannot assume liability
for improper access to it. By using the Services, or providing personal
information to us through any means, you do so at your own risk and you agree
that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy,
and administrative issues relating to your use of our Services.<br><br>

An
important element of our safeguards to protect your personal information is
verification of&nbsp;your identity before granting you access to your Account
via a unique password. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your
unique password and Account information, and for controlling access to your
email communications from SnagFilms, at all times.<br><br>
