<p>
	We may combine all of the information we collect about you and use it individually or collectively in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
	At certain parts of the SnagFilms Site, (e.g. to post a comment to our blog, post a comment on the user comment section, sign up for our e-newsletter, responding surveys) only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the relevant activities and offerings.</p>
<p>
	<strong>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>
	We may use the information you provide about yourself in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you and to improve the user experience we provide.</p>
<p>
	SnagFilmsâs use of this information includes the following general purposes: customizing the content and advertising you view; responding to your inquiries about our offerings; fulfilling your requests for products, programs or services; offering products, programs or services we believe may be of interest to you; identifying the comments you post when you use the SnagFilms Services; improving our services; conducting research; compiling aggregate data for internal and external business purposes; preventing potentially illegal activities; protecting our rights; and other uses in accordance with our Terms of Use; and for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect your information.</p>
<p>
	While using the SnagFilms Site you will have opportunities to comment on movies and individual pages. If you choose to submit content for publication, we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us. Please understand that when you post such information, it is made public and is not subject to this policy.</p>
<p>
	We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>
<p>
	Anonymous data is information (whether it was originally personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable) that subsequently is used in aggregate form. We may use anonymous data for purposes of research or analysis. We may conduct research on our customer demographics, internet usage, and interests and behavior based on personal data we gather. Although anonymous data may be based in part on personal data, it does not identify you personally. SnagFilms may share this type of anonymous data with a variety of third parties, including its affiliates, advertisers and other current and prospective business partners. Because the information is anonymous, these third parties will not be able to contact you based on this data.</p>
<p>
	We may also use anonymous data collected for website administration, advertising and promotional purposes, and we may share such information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities for such purposes. IP addresses are also used to provide anonymous aggregated data to advertisers about the volume of use on the SnagFilms Services, and non-personally identifiable information about your activities may be used to customize advertising messages. Anonymous usage and demographic information may also be shared with our advertisers and business partners.</p>
<p>
	We sometimes use your information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when we make changes to the SnagFilms Site or to fulfill a request by you to receive our weekly newsletter.</p>
<p>
	SnagFilms may display targeted advertisements based on personal information. SnagFilms does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad, although advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria. We may also use your personal information to provide you with promotional information about SnagFilmsâs features, services, and other offerings that may be of interest to you, or to provide information or offers to you that are related to the SnagFilms Services on behalf of our business partners. We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agencyâs request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Web Site and applicable laws or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements.</p>
<p>
	In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable information about you if we, or one of our business units, are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company. Agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.</p>
<p>
	SnagFilms enables and encourages users to âsnagâ or take embeddable players with our films and related content from our site, and to embed these players on personal web pages, blogs, and other sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of personal information may differ from ours. We hope that you will take our films with you via the embeddable player and enjoy and share them in this way; please read the privacy policies of the sites where you embed a player, as SnagFilms cannot be responsible for the information handling practices of these other sites.</p>
<p>
	Finally, SnagFilms stores information about which films you view in streaming flash format. This information is currently not used but may be used in the future without notice to determine Website usage patterns.</p>
<p>
	We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.</p>
