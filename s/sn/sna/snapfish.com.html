<b>
<a name="what-snapfish-collects"></a>
<i>What Customer Information does Snapfish collect?</i>
</b>
<br>
Customer Information is requested whenever you choose to use Snapfish services.  
The type of Customer Information we request has to do specifically with the type of 
service you are using.  For example:

</p><p>
â€¢  <i>When you want to upload digital pictures or to view other's pictures on the Site,</i> 
we will ask you to provide your first and last name, an email address and a password. 
</p><p>
â€¢  <i>When you want Snapfish to develop your film,</i> 
we will also ask for a billing address, a shipping address, and a credit card number for 
the payment of development and shipping and handling costs.  
</p><p>
â€¢  <i>When you want to share your pictures with others (<b>"Invitees"</b>),</i>
we will ask for email addresses of friends and family you choose to share with.  
</p><p>
â€¢  <i>When you complete a purchase from Snapfish,</i> we will ask you to provide shipping 
and billing information so that we can fulfill your request (alternatively,  you can 
provide such information in registration and we will not need to request it again). 
</p><p>
You also give information when you answer survey questions and organize your photos on 
Snapfish with titles, captions, categories, etc. 
</p><p>
Snapfish offers many optional promotional opportunities for which you may decide to 
submit Customer Information.  For example, Snapfish may occasionally run contests or 
other special promotions on our site in which we ask members or visitors for contact 
information (like an email address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, 
or your camera brand). We may use the data we collect in these contests and promotions 
to send you promotional material about our company or our partners or sponsors. Your 
customer contact information collected from these contests and promotions may be used 
to contact you when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional 
purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and conditions 
specified when you take part in the promotion. <b>You are never required to take part 
in a contest or promotion â€” you may always simply decline if you do not wish to 
provide requested information.</b>




</p><p>
<a name="how-information-used"></a>
<b><i>How is Customer Information used by Snapfish?</i></b>
<br>
Our primary goal in collecting your Customer Information is to provide you with 
a very personalized, relevant, user-friendly Web experience on the Snapfish site. 
Here are the ways that we use Customer Information to offer this experience:
</p><p>
</p><p>
<i>Customer Communication</i>:  <b>We use Customer Information to communicate with you, and 
we consider this communication to be an integral part of  the Snapfish service.</b>  
To keep this communication going, we use your email and mailing address to inform you 
of site improvements, feature announcements, newsletters, Snapfish promotional offers, 
and occasional third-party promotional offers that may be of interest to you. Only 
Snapfish (or agents working on behalf of Snapfish under confidentiality agreements) 
will send you these direct mailings. This is a key component of "active participation" 
in the Service (see our Terms and Conditions).   If you do not wish to be an active 
participant, you may always cancel your Snapfish membership by 
writing <a href="mailto:cancel@snapfish.com?subject=R02: Cancel my account">cancel@snapfish.com</a>. 
We will delete your account 
and remove and discard any content and Customer Information associated with your 
account (personal information, uploaded images, comments, etc.)
</p><p>
<i>Customer Satisfaction</i>:  <b>We use Customer Information to make your Snapfish experience 
enjoyable.</b>  For example, because we know who you are after you log in, we know to 
load the right set of albums into your Shoebox ( your password-protected area on Snapfish). 
We also know where to email you to let you know your photos are ready for viewing online. 
Furthermore, if (for example) we know you are a new mom or dad, we know you may appreciate 
a promotional offer via email for discounted photo birth announcements from Snapfish or a 
coupon for discounts on baby clothes from a baby Web site. 
</p><p>
<i>Customer Convenience</i>:  <b>We use Customer Information to provide you with the 
convenience of easy access to the services you request.</b>  When you choose to use 
the Snapfish Service for its free film developing and digitization service or for 
purchasing merchandise, we will ask for credit card information and for your 
mailing address, so that we can send you your Snapfish Welcome Kit, your prints 
and negatives, and your Snapfish mailers. In the case of film developing, we will 
automatically charge your credit card account for any developing and shipping and 
handling fees. For a merchandise purchase, we will ask for final confirmation before 
charging your credit card. We may collect information during the shopping experience 
to make purchasing an easier and better experience for you. For example, if you 
give us permission to keep your billing information, you won't have to fill out 
the shipping and billing address each and every time you purchase. 
</p><p>
<i>Customer Offers</i>:  <b>We use Customer Information to offer you relevant information 
and promotions.</b>  In order to make the site more relevant to you we may direct advertising 
from our sponsors according to the interests of our users. For instance, if we know you are a 
new mom or dad, we may show you an ad for diapers, while your brother, who likes sports, might 
see an ad for running shoes. Ultimately, this makes the service far more valuable to each 
individual.  Also, as a part of Snapfish's goal to create a fun, safe and useful site, 
Snapfish may make available to you optional email newsletters with interesting content 
about photography and other subjects in additional to our regular email updates. When we 
offer you optional emails, you may always opt out of receiving them by checking an opt-out box. 
</p><p>
Note that one reason we are able to offer you relevant promotions is that we reserve the 
right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For example, we might 
tell a prospective advertiser that 10,000 of our members have indicated an interest in golf, 
and then distribute an attractive offer exclusively to those users. Your Customer Information, 
however, will never be personally identifiable when aggregated for these purposes.
 

</p><p>
<a name="with-whom-share"></a>
<b><i>With whom does Snapfish share Customer Information?</i></b><br>
Snapfish shares your Customer Information with third party intermediaries (for example, 
credit card authorization company, photo processing lab, merchandise distributors, etc.) who 
help us run the Snapfish service and site. Your Customer Information is provided to these third 
parties solely for the purpose of giving you the services you request at the time that you 
request them.  Third party intermediaries do not store, retain, access or otherwise use your 
Customer Information other than as necessary to provide you with the Snapfish service.  
</p><p>
<b>Other than as described in the previous paragraph, Snapfish will not sell, rent or otherwise 
share Customer Information with a third party without your knowledge and consent prior to any 
data collection or transfer.</b>  If you do not want your Customer Information shared at that time 
you will always have the option of telling us not to share it. For those purposes, "Snapfish" 
means Snapfish.com Corporation and any successors to the assets or business of Snapfish.com 
Corporation. 
</p><p>
Advertisers on Snapfish do not have access to your individual account information. 
Advertisers simply give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach 
(for example, males over 35 years old, or 18-34 year olds interested in outdoor sports). 
Snapfish then displays the ad only to users who meet those criteria. 
</p><p>
The one exception to the rule described in this section is the following: if Snapfish is 
required by law (or to protect its rights or property), we will disclose Customer Information 
to the extent so required. 


</p><p>
<a name="who-sees-photos"></a>
<b><i>Who sees your photos after they have been posted online?</i></b><br>
You, your Invitees and their Invitees can see your albums online. An Invitee is defined as 
anyone who is invited to the Snapfish site to see an album. Anyone who is invited to see an 
album online must provide an email address and a password to access the site and view a shared 
album.   When you choose to share your online images with Invitees, those individuals will be 
able to view your name. If you don't want your Invitees to invite other people to see the album, 
you can select the "No" option on the album invite. That will prohibit them from re-sharing 
the album from within their account on the Snapfish site. However, as with any email, your 
Invitees could forward the email invitation to others, who will then be able to click on 
the link to the album within the email, and see the pictures too. 


</p><p>
<a name="does-snapfish-use"></a>
<b><i>Does Snapfish use "IP Addresses" and cookies?</i></b>
<br>
Snapfish uses IP Addresses and Cookies in limited ways, as follows:
</p><p>
<i>IP Addresses</i>:  An IP address is literally your computer's address and is a unique 
identifier, allowing online information to be sent to the right place. We use IP 
addresses to better understand the customer database. We use your IP address to help 
diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also 
used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members. 
We do not intentionally link your IP address to your personally identifiable information. 
</p><p>
<i>Snapfish Cookies</i>:   Contrary to popular belief, cookies do not extract private or 
personal information from your computer's memory. The job of a cookie is to record only 
information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny 
files placed onto the hard drive of your computer the first time you visit our Web site that 
enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are next time you come back. 
Currently, Snapfish intends to make only limited use of cookies for the purpose of delivering 
content and ads specific to your interests. For instance cookies may be used to retain your 
personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save your password 
so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time you log in. 
</p><p>
<i>Advertiser Cookies</i>:   Snapfish does post third party advertising banners. These ads 
may contain cookies used primarily to provide data to the advertiser about where visitors 
are coming from. While we do use cookies in other parts of our Web site as explained above, 
cookies received with banner ads may or may not be collected or controlled by our company.   
When you click on a banner ad, you should be aware that the advertiser may be collecting 
information without the permission of Snapfish.   
</p><p>
Snapfish works with two third party ad serving services, the Sonar Network and Engage Media, 
to help serve ads for this site. Snapfish does not control the privacy practices of these 
services. To find out more about how each of these third parties manages the privacy of 
information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, 
please review the <a href="javascript:openVeriSignWindow('http://www.sonarnetwork.com/content/privacy.htm')">Sonar Network 
privacy policy</a> and the <a href="javascript:openVeriSignWindow('http://www.engage.com/privacy')">Engage Media privacy policy</a>. 
</p><p>
<i>Advice on Limiting Cookies</i>:  You always have a choice with respect to cookies. 
By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept all cookies, be notified when a 
cookie is set or reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you may be unable 
to use certain Snapfish services. Please consult your browser instructions for information 
on how to modify your choices about cookies. 


</p><p>
<a name="what-safeguards"></a>
<b><i>What are the safeguards and security procedures in place to protect your 
information from loss, misuse, or alteration?</i></b> 
<br>
Your Customer Information on our Service is password-protected. We strongly recommend 
that you do not give your password to anyone and that you change it every 3 months. 
You may edit your Snapfish account information by using your Snapfish member name and password. 
</p><p>
If you are using a public computer (public library, school computer, etc.) or a shared 
computer (family computer, roommate's computer, etc.), we strongly recommend that you sign 
out of your Snapfish account and close your browser before getting up and moving away from 
the computer. This will prevent others from accessing your account and personal information. 
Please note that because our company is particularly sensitive to protecting information 
about children on the Internet, kids under 13 are not eligible to be members of Snapfish. 
However, we encourage parents to use our service as a family activity with their children 
and to carefully monitor any Internet activities (including use of the Snapfish services) 
engaged in by their kids. 
</p><p>
Snapfish employs SSL to encrypt and protect your Customer Information. We understand that 
this is especially important when there is an exchange of credit card, billing and password 
information. In addition, we limit access of Customer Information to only those employees 
who need it to carry out their jobs. 
</p><p>
<b>Snapfish will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an 
unsolicited email.</b> You will only be asked for your member name and password when you 
initiate the contact and only if the member name and password are necessary to correct a 
service problem. 


</p><p>
<a name="how-update"></a>
<b><i>How can you update or correct Customer Information?</i></b>
<br>
Customer Information that you provide during registration is available in your Snapfish 
member profile. To edit your Customer Information, you must enter your member name and 
password in order to access your profile. You may edit your member profile at any time. 
</p><p>
You can also cancel your Snapfish membership by writing 
<a href="mailto:cancel@snapfish.com?subject=R02: Cancel my account">cancel@snapfish.com</a>. 
We will delete your account and remove and discard any content associated with your account 
(personal information, uploaded images, comments, etc.). 
 
 
</p><p>
<a name="other-info"></a>
<b><i>Other information about privacy</i></b>
<br><i>Visitors outside the United States</i>:<br>
For those of you visiting us from the European 
Economic Area, please note that if you access our Service, the information you enter 
will be transferred outside the European Economic Area. By participating in the Service, 
you consent to this transfer and to the information usage described above. Snapfish does not 
currently solicit or encourage usage by individuals outside of the United States. If you choose 
to access our Site from outside the United States, you take responsibility for compliance with 
applicable privacy laws of your country of residence. 
</p><p>
<i>Links from the Snapfish Site</i>: If you click away from Snapfish to visit the site of any third 
party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or other personal information 
in order to purchase or use products and services offered. These companies have their 
own privacy and data collection practices.  As described above,  Snapfish has no responsibility 
or liability for these independent policies. You should therefore review their privacy 
policies carefully if you have concerns about how your information may be used. 
</p><p>
<i>Notification of Change</i>:  If Snapfish intends to expand the ways that Customer Information 
is used under this Privacy Policy, we will notify our members beforehand. 
</p></font><p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">

of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:service@snapfish.com?subject=R03: My questions">service@snapfish.com</a>.
