This is the web site of <b>Webattack, Inc.</b>.<br>
</p><p>Our postal address is: <br>
<b>WebAttack.com<br>
PO Box 522741<br>
Marathon, FL 33050</b></p>

<b>Information Collection and Use</b><p></p>

<p>WebAttack, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will 
not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is 
disclosed in this statement.  WebAttack, Inc. collects information from our users at 
several different points on our website.</p>

<p><b>Registration</b><br>
In order to use some parts of this website (e.g. forums or member areas), a user must 
first complete the registration form.  During registration a user is required to give 
their contact information (such as name and email address).  This information is used to 
contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest.  
It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and 
gender or personal interests), and unique identifiers, but encouraged so we can provide a 
more personalized experience on our site.
</p>

<p><b>Orders/Membership subscriptions</b><br>
We request information from the user on our order form.  Here a user must provide contact 
information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card 
number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes and to fill 
customer's orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is 
used to get in touch with the user.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>

<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information 
about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable 
information while on our site.  Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply 
terminates.  For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log 
in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects 
the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user will 
be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, the user will not be able to use 
certain features of our bulletin board or other parts of the site that offer customized 
settings. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to 
enhance the experience on our site.
</p>

<p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).  
However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. Please refer to the privacy policies of the network for details.

</p>

<p><b>Log Files</b></p>

<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and 
gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to 
personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><b>Sharing</b></p>

<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. 
This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual 
person.</p>

<p>We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. 
These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for 
any secondary purposes.</p>

<p><br>
<b>Links</b></p>

<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we WebAttack, Inc. 
are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users 
to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every 
web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement 
applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
</p>

<p><b>Newsletter</b><br>
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as 
name and email address.</p>

<p><b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b></p>

<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore 
has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may 
include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic 
information (such as zip code, age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the 
winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or 
improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>

<p><b>Tell-A-Friend</b></p>

<p>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.  WebAttack, Inc. will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  WebAttack, Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.  The friend may contact WebAttack, Inc. at <a href="mailto:admin@webattack.com">admin@webattack.com</a> to request the removal of this information from their database.
</p>

<p><b>Security</b></p>

<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users 
submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online 
and off-line.</p>

<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.  To learn more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://www.ssl.com">http://www.ssl.com</a></p>


<p><br>
<b>Site and Service Update</b><br>
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are able to 
un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the 
service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to 
issues relating to their account via email</p>


<p><b>Choice/Opt-out</b></p>

<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by using the unsubscribe link include in every mailing or visiting <a href="subscribe/">http://www.webattack.com/emupdate.html</a></p>


<p><b>Notification of Changes</b></p>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage 
so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under 
circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally 
identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was 
collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to 
whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information 
in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
