Commitment to Privacy</font></b></font></p><p align="CENTER"></p><p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
privacy of your personally identifiable information is important to us. As part 
of our commitment to the privacy of your personally identifiable information, 
we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices 
you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this site. 
To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at 
every point where personally identifiable information is requested. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy are for this site only. Other 
Snap-on affiliate Web sites may have different practices (see appendix of sites 
below). If you link to or otherwise visit these or any other Web sites, please 
review the privacy policies posted at those sites. </font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="2">The 
Information We Collect </font></b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
general, when you visit our site you remain anonymous, but on some pages, you 
need to provide personally identifiable information to register, order products 
and contact Snap-on Incorporated ("Snap-on"). The types of personally identifiable 
information collected at these pages may include: </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Name, 
Company, Snap-on Customer Number (if applicable), Address, E-mail Address, Phone 
Number, Fax Number, and Credit/Debit Card/Procurement Card Information </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
also enable you to submit information about other people. For example, we request 
that you provide us with information about your dealer or representative or, if 
you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might 
submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable 
information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: dealer 
or representative’s name and contact information, and a gift recipient's name, 
address, e-mail address, and telephone number. </font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="2">The 
Way We Use Information</font></b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
use the information you provide when placing an order or accessing this Web site 
to complete that order and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. 
</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We maintain 
credit/debit card/procurement card information only until payment for your order 
is processed unless you authorize the information to be stored for future visits. 
If you later decide that you do not want us to store such information, you may 
contact us at </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="mailto:eorders@snapon.com"><font size="2">eorders@snapon.com</font></a><font size="2"> 
and ask us to delete such information. </font></font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
also use your information to communicate with you, for example, to answer the 
e-mail and correspondence we receive, to confirm your order, to send more information 
about becoming a dealer, to send renewal notices, and to notify you of important 
changes in the functionality of the Web site. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
may use your information to make recommendations for additional products or special 
offers, and to provide you with updates on new products that we believe may be 
of interest to you. If you do not want to receive this information in the future, 
please contact us at </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="mailto:eorders@snapon.com"><font size="2">eorders@snapon.com</font></a><font size="2">.</font></font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From 
time to time, we may share certain information with select third parties including 
other Snap-on affiliates and independent Snap-on dealers in your area to enable 
them to offer products or services that may be of interest to you. If you do not 
want us to share your information, please contact us at </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="mailto:eorders@snapon.com"><font size="2">eorders@snapon.com</font></a><font size="2">.</font></font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"></p><p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process 
or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response 
to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency’s request.</font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online 
in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first providing you an opportunity 
to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. </font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="2">Customization 
and Aggregate data</font></b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site and 
gather information for product management and development at Snap-on. For example, 
we may tell our sales and marketing staff that X number of individuals visited 
a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of software licenses were ordered 
during a particular time period, but we would not disclose anything that could 
be used to identify those individuals. This aggregate information may also be 
shared with Snap-on's affiliates and independent dealers. </font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="2">Our 
Commitment to Data Security</font></b></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard 
and secure the information we collect online. When you place orders or access 
your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server 
software receives encrypted information through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
of your internet browser which encrypts the information you input before it is 
sent to us and prevents anyone else from reading it as the information travels 
from your computer to ours. If you are still concerned about placing an order 
online, call a customer service representative at 1-877-762-7664 and place your 
order via phone.</font></p>
