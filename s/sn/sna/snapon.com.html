        Commitment to Privacy</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The privacy of your 
        personally-identifiable information is important to us. As part of our 
        commitment to the privacy of your personally-identifiable information, 
        we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and 
        the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and 
        used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage 
        and at every point where personally-identifiable information may be requested. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The privacy practices 
        set forth in this Privacy Policy are for this Site only.&nbsp; Other Snap-on 
        affiliate web sites may have different practices.&nbsp; If you link to or otherwise 
        visit these or any other websites, please review the privacy policies

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>The Information 
        We Collect </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">In general, when 
        you visit our Site you remain anonymous, but on some pages, you need to 
        provide personally-identifiable information to register, order products 
        and contact Snap-on Incorporated ("Snap-on"). The types of personally-identifiable 
        information collected at these pages may include: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Name, Company , Snap-on 
        Customer Number (if applicable), Address, City, State, Zip Code, Country, 
        Email Address, Phone Number, Fax Number, Credit/Debit Card/Procurement 
        Card Information </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>The Way We Use 
        Information</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">We use the information 
        you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete that order 
        or to provide a more personalized shopping experience. We do not and will 
        not share this information with third parties other than Snap-on's affiliates 
        and employees except to the extent necessary to complete that order. In 
        addition, we may share certain information about you and any purchases 
        you make with independent Snap-on dealers in your area.&nbsp; We maintain credit/debit 
        card/procurement card information only until payment for your order is 
        processed unless you authorize the information to be stored for future 
        visits. If you later decide that you do not want us to store such information, 
        you may contact us at <a href="mailto:eorders@snapon.com">eorders@snapon.com</a> 
        and ask us to delete such information. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">We use information 
        about your purchases to make recommendations for additional products or 
        special offers you might be interested in unless you tell us you do not 
        want to receive such information, in which case you can contact us at 
        <a href="mailto:eorders@snapon.com">eorders@snapon.com</a> and ask us 
        to stop sending you such information. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">We also use return 
        email addresses and customer addresses which you provide to us when placing 
        an order or accessing this website to answer the email and correspondence 
        we receive, confirm your order, send renewal notices, notify you of important 
        changes in the functionality of the Web site, update you on new products, 
        and communicate special offers we think you might be interested in. Such 
        addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with third 
        parties other than Snap-on's affiliates and independent Dealers. If you 
        do not want to receive this information in the future, please contact 
        us at <a href="mailto:eorders@snapon.com">eorders@snapon.com</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">&nbsp;We use non-identifying 
        and aggregate information to better design our Web site and gather information 
        for product management and development at Snap-on. For example, we may 
        tell our sales and marketing staff that X number of individuals visited 
        a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of software licenses 
        were ordered during a particular time period, but we would not disclose 
        anything that could be used to identify those individuals. This information 
        may also be shared with Snap-on's affiliates and independent dealers. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Finally, we will 
        not use or share the personally-identifiable information provided to us 
        online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first providing 
        you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated 
        uses. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>Our Commitment 
        to Data Security</b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">We have put in place 
        physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure 
        the information we collect online. When you place orders or access your 
        account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server 
        software receives encrypted information through the Secure Sockets Layer 
        (SSL) of your internet browser which encrypts the information you input 
        before it is sent to us and prevents anyone else from reading it as the 
        information travels from your computer to ours.&nbsp; If you are still concerned 
        about placing an order online, call a customer service representative
