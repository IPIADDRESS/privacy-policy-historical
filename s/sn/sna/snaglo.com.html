In order for us to provide you with services on our website, your browser must accept cookies as they are essential for website administration and security.  We do not use cookies either to collect individually identifiable information or to collect non-individually identifiable information using a cookie that is combined with a personal identifier.</p>
<p><strong>		 WHAT GENERAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>General information is information about you or your activities on our website that does not identify you personally.  When you use the internet, your web browser or software may communicate certain information to the host website you visit.  This information may include the unique number assigned to your server or internet connection, the capabilities and features of your computer, you geographic location and your movement and activity within a particular website.  We collect the same information on our website. We use this general information to generate statistics about visitors to our website and to improve our service.  Your account is password protected and you are not permitted to provide your password to anyone else as further discussed in our Terms and Conditions and for your privacy.</p>
<p><strong>USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>The information we collect is used to (i) respond to your inquiries; (ii) provide customer service and resolve any complaints; (iii) improve the website and our services and to help resolve any technical problems; (iv) communicate with you concerning the services offered on the website by us or any of our partners; (v) cross-reference with other personal information that we have acquired about you or may acquire about you through other sources; (vi) create aggregate data; (vii) ensure compliance with the website Terms and Conditions; and (viii) comply with any applicable laws and regulations.  We may provide your information to government officials and agencies as required by law, and partners as part of business operations, for transaction processing and marketing efforts.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, partner shall mean any person or entity with whom we enter into any kind of business transaction who is under an obligation to us to use reasonable care to keep personal information confidential.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, trade or disclose to third parties any personal information obtained by us through this website or from our partners about you without your consent.  We may disclose personal information (i) to companies that help process the transactions you request in order to protect your transactions from fraud and verify your identity; (ii) that we in good faith believe is necessary or appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud, intellectual property infringements or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability; (iii) to conduct investigations of violations of the website Terms and Conditions; (iv) when required by law or to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant or other legal process; (v) to comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of governmental authorities (including, without limitation, requests from the governmental agencies to view your personal information); (vi) to protect and defend us and any of our officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors and partners in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute; (vii) to prevent imminent physical harm; (viii) to provide data, including personal information about you, to our partners as well as other business partners with whom we deem it necessary to communicate in order to provide our services (e.g., Authorize.Net); (ix) to sell or otherwise provide the information to third parties in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation; and (x) to sell or otherwise provide information to third parties in the event of a future merger or acquisition by another company.

<p><strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form.  We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system.  Although no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented on our website reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.</p>
<p><strong>HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements.  For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space.  We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it.  In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely.  Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control.  Please note that we have greater control over recently collected data than over archived data.  Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests.  In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.</p>

<p>If you do not want us to share your personal information with our partners for marketing purposes or if you do not want to receive communications and offers from us, you can make that election by writing to us at privacy@snaglo.com.</p>
<p><strong>ACCESS AND UPDATING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>You may request access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at privacy@snaglo.com.
