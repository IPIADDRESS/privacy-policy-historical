We ask that you do not enter personal information or                        financial information into your "Profile" (for example, don't use your address                        or passcode as your username, or include your name or address in your written                        responses), because if you do then it may be posted publicly on the Service,                        and the information will then be treated as "demographic                        information" that is "public information."

                  <p>In some cases, we may enter into a                      promotional relationship with another company in which we prominently display                      their brand name or trademarks on pages of the Service. These pages are known                      as "Co-Branded Pages" and these companies are known as "Co-Branded                      Companies." If the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page,                      or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share                      your personal information with the associated Co-Branded Company. Co-Branded                      Companies may use your personal information in accordance with their own                      privacy policies. You will need to contact Co-Branded Companies to instruct                      them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal                      information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all                      such information so submitted to such Co-Branded Companies in the same manner                      in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit                      to us. Some Co-Branded Pages may contain an action tag (also known as a Web                      Beacon or a 1 pixel .gif file) that a third party, may use to read cookies                      that it, or its clients, may have placed on your browser at other                      (non-Snapsext.com) web sites before your visit to Snapsext.com. This technology                      is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements on such other Websites                      that promote Co-Branded Pages. Further, such other third parties may use the                      information collected through this technology to learn more about your visits                      to this Service and other Websites in order to provide advertisements about                      goods and services of interest to you.</p>

                    <p>We may review all demographic information.                        We may use public information to enable other users to find your profile, to                        determine whether they are a match for you and to communicate with you. We                        may use demographic information to tailor the Service and communications to                        your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on                        an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers your                        identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood                        that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to Snapsext.com's users,                        so that we may target specific ads at specific demographic groups. Our                        sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do                        not tell advertisers which particular Snapsext.com users are members of which                        demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you                        respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad                        that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser                        your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as                        being a member of that demographic group. Please also be aware that when we                        disclose your financial information or personal information to a Co-Branded                        Company, as described above, we may also disclose to that Co-Branded Company                        your demographic information, other than the content of one-on-one                        communications between you and other members. Please also be aware that we                        may disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis as                        described above in the paragraph titled "Special Cases in which we Share                        Personal and Financial Information."
