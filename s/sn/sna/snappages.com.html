				</h2><h3>Profile and Registration Information submitted by Registered Users to SnapPages</h3>

				<p>SnapPages.com is a  collection of tools to help you organize your life. Your creations can then be  shared to your network of friends, family, community or kept private. One  feature of this community is that it connects people and their online pages  through networks. To accomplish this, each SnapPages Member registers and  enters some personal information that enables searchability for Members  (“Friends”) and/or for use in future products such as profile pages, address  books, etc…. Other uses of this information is for notifications sent to  members related to SnapPages services. Any information that is entered will not  be made public without the consent of the Member. This personal information  includes such things as: <br>
  ·&nbsp; First  name and last names of the Member,<br>
  ·&nbsp; Email  Address<br>
  ·&nbsp; City,  State, and Zip<br>
  ·&nbsp; Gender,  age, and other, similar personal information, <br>
  ·&nbsp;  Location (e.g., city and state), and <br>
  ·&nbsp;  Photos, videos or other shared content uploaded by the Member to his or  her profile, to the extent that it includes personal information. </p>

				<h3>Other Information submitted  by Members to SnapPages </h3>
				<p>You should also be  aware that Members may reveal other personal information while communicating on  other areas of SnapPages. Areas might include blogs, forums, groups, etc… This  information, in turn, might be viewed by other Members or visitors to SnapPages  who are not Members. </p>

				<h3>Information Not Directly  Submitted by Members or Other Website Users to SnapPages</h3>
				<p>Finally, we also  collect some information from Members, as well as from other visitors to the SnapPages  website, that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP  address. This information is gathered from all Members and visitors to the  website. </p>

				<h2><br>Use of Information Obtained by SnapPages</h2>

				<h3>Information submitted by  Members to SnapPages </h3>
				<p>Only upon Member  consent will the personal information of a member be shown to those people whom  the Member chooses. All SnapPages tools offer options when saving such as  Private, Secure and Public. Future applications might offer the ability for  SnapPages Members to share some of the information entered in either a profile  area or the registered area public. Certain information not considered personal  that might be made public include last login or number of views. <br>
				  Except where a Member  might choose to include a full name in public information, a Member's email  address and full name will only be used in the following circumstances: </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>When the Member invites a friend via email to become a SnapPages  Member, </li>
				  <li>When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her  use of the SnapPages service or SnapPages website, and </li>
				  <li>When the Member sends a request to another Member to add the  other Member to his or her friend list, </li>
				  <li>If the Member so chooses, when we send regular notifications,  updates or other news regarding SnapPages. </li>
				  </ul>
				<p>Except when inviting  or adding friends, a Member's email address will never be shared with or  displayed to any other person unless a Member chooses to make that information  public or secure (viewable by Friends only). Members and their friends, and  other Members within their personal networks (depending on the level of sharing  a Member has chosen) communicate on SnapPages with each other, without  disclosing email addresses. </p>
