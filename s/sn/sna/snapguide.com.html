</div>


<div class="ui-about-section">
<p>
  We recognize that your privacy is very important and take it seriously.
  This Privacy Policy describes Snapguide's policies and procedures on the
  collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use the
  Snapguide Service.   We will not use or share your information with
  anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy
  does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline)
  or from other sources.  Capitalized terms that are not defined in this
  Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our <a href="//snapguide.com/about/terms">Terms of Service</a>.
</p>
<div class="subtopic">Information Collection and Use</div>
<p>
  Snapguide uses information we collect to determine your interests in
  order to provide you with the Service, analyze how the Service is used,
  diagnose service or technical problems, maintain security, personalize
  content, remember information to help you efficiently access your account,
  monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and
  demographic patterns, and track user Content and users as necessary to
  comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> You provide us information
  about yourself, such as your name, e-mail address, and access to data about
  your use of online services, if you sign up for the Service, including by
  signing into Snapguide with a third-party service or adding a
  Snapguide application on a social network.  Your profile information,
  Content you post, and information about your use of the Service that you
  elect to make public will be available for public viewing on the Service
  and via our syndication channels.
</p>
<p>
  We may use your email address to send you Service-related notices
  (including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal
  mail).  You can control receipt of certain Service-related messages on your
  Settings page.  We may also use your contact information to send you
  marketing messages.  If you do not want to receive such messages, you may
  opt out by following the instructions in the message.  If you correspond
  with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages,
  your email address and our responses.
</p>
<p>
  If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the
  Service, we will ask you for that person's email address and automatically
  send an email invitation.  Snapguide stores this information to send
  this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and
  to track the success of our invitation service.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Cookies:</strong> When you visit the Service, we may send one
  or more “cookies” - a small data file - to your computer to uniquely
  identify your browser and let Snapguide help you log in faster and
  enhance your navigation through the site.  A cookie may convey anonymous
  information about how you browse the Service to us, but does not collect
  personal information about you.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard
  drive after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser
  on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by
  following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary
  and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web
  browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
  sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if
  the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Log Files:</strong> Log file information is automatically
  reported by your browser each time you access a web page.  When you use
  the Service, our servers automatically record certain information that
  your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server
  logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
  (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of
  clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such
  information.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Clear Gifs Information:</strong>  When you use the Service, we
  may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to
  track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously.  No personally
  identifiable information from your Snapguide account is collected using
  these clear gifs.  In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based
  emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.
  The information is used to enable more accurate reporting and make
  Snapguide better for our users.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Third Party Services:</strong> Snapguide uses several third
  party analytics services to help understand use of the Service. These
  services collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web
  page request, including cookies and your IP address. They also receive
  this information and their use of it is governed by their Privacy
  Policy(s).
</p>
<div class="subtopic">How We Share Your Information</div>
<p>
  <strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>  Snapguide may
  share your personally identifiable information with third parties for
  the purpose of providing the Service to you.  If we do this, such third
  parties’ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy.
  We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control
  of Snapguide (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with
  hosting providers).
</p>
<p>
  As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business
  offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of
  the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may
  also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate
  divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
</p>
<p>
  We may share or disclose your information with your consent. We cannot
  control third parties’ use of your information.
</p>
<p>
  Snapguide may disclose your personal information if required to do so
  by law or subpoena or if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to
  comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of
  any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect
  Snapguide’s rights or property.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>  We may share
  non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data,
  referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.)
  with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns
  for certain Snapguide services.
</p>
<p>
  Snapguide may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve
  advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks
  use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and
  links that appear on Snapguide. They automatically receive your IP
  address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as
  cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their
  advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.  Snapguide
  does not provide any personally identifiable information to these
  third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However,
  please note that if an advertiser asks Snapguide to show an
  advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement,
  the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of
  the audience they are trying to reach. The Snapguide Privacy Policy does
  not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party
  advertisers.  Please consult the respective privacy policies of such
  advertisers for more information.
</p>
<div class="subtopic">How We Protect Your Information</div>
<p>
  Snapguide uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and
  technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your
  personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security
  of any information you transmit to Snapguide or guarantee that your
  information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or
  destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial
  safeguards.
</p>
<p>
  In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a
  breach of security, Snapguide will promptly notify those persons whose
  personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the
  notification procedures set forth in our
  <a href="//snapguide.com/about/terms">Terms of Service</a>,
  or as otherwise required by applicable law.
</p>
<div class="subtopic">Your Choices About Your Information</div>
<p>
  You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information
  through the Service, in which case Snapguide may not be able to provide
  certain services to you. You may use the settings on the Service to control
  how certain information about you or your use of the Service is published,
  as further described on the Service.  You may update or correct your
  account information and email preferences at any time by logging in to
  your account.
</p>
<div class="subtopic">Children's Privacy</div>
<p>
  Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.
  Snapguide does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information
  from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register
  with the Service. If we become aware that we have collected personal
  information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental
  consent, we take steps to remove that information.
</p>
<div class="subtopic">Links to Other Web Sites</div>
<p>
  We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to
  or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein.
  Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another
  website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and
  interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our
  website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies.
</p>
<div class="subtopic">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</div>
<p>
  If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those
  changes on this page to keep you aware of what information we collect,
  how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.  Changes
  to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
