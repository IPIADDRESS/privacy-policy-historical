<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p id="par1">
Last Updated: June 24, 2013<br><br>This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Ansa, Inc. and our subsidiaries (“Ansa”, “we”, “us”) when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.<br><br>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do so, we will notify you by changing the date at the top of the policy. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy whenever you access Ansa to learn more about the ways you can help protect your privacy and stay informed about our information practices.
</p>
<h2 id="hea1">Collection of Information</h2>
<h3 id="head1">Information You Give Us</h3>
<p id="par2">
We collect the information you give directly to us. For instance, we collect information when you register and create an account, use the Ansa services to send or receive a message, request help or support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, username, password, email address, phone number, age and any other information you choose to provide.<br><br>When you receive or send messages, we also collect, process and store the content of the messages (such as text, photos, videos and/or edits and captions) on our servers. The content of these messages are also stored on the devices of recipients, until the messages are erases by you or by the recipient. The Ansa mobile application is programmed to delete self-destructing messages from the recipient’s device after they have been viewed for the amount of time you specify. However, in rare cases, the Ansa application does not perform as programmed, thus we cannot guarantee that deletion always occurs within this timeframe. We also cannot prevent others from making copies of your messages (e.g., by taking a screenshot), but if we are able to detect that the recipient has captured a screenshot of a message that you send, we will attempt to notify you. In addition, as for any other digital information, there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients' devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted.
</p>

<h3 id="head11">Device Information</h3>
<p id="par12">Certain features of the Services require access to your device's native phonebook and image storage applications (e.g., to find friends or to store a Message in your photo gallery). If you choose to find friends, the phone numbers in your device's native phonebook will be transmitted to Ansa. Although you may decide whether or not to use these features, on Android devices you grant Ansa permission to access these features as part of the installation process. If you later decide to revoke this permission, you can do so by following the standard uninstall process and removing the Ansa mobile application from your device. Alternatively, on iOS devices, you can grant or revoke your consent at any time and prevent us from continuing to access your phonebook and image storage applications by changing the settings on your device.
