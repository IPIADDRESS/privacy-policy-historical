<p class="MsoNormal">We care about your privacy.&nbsp; We want to tell you in
detail about the Internet policies and practices which we have adopted to
protect your privacy so that you can feel confident about how we handle the
personal information you entrust to us online.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While we do not intend to make changes to our policies very
often, it is always a good idea to double check when you visit our site to be
sure that you have read and agree with our most current policy statement. Any
change in our privacy policy will be prospective only.&nbsp; We will not make
any changes that have retroactive effect unless legally required to do so.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The content on our site may include, among other items of

do we collect personal information? <o:p>

We only collect personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail
addresses, hobby or activity information, demographic information (age, gender,
etc.), taste or preference information, and the like, when voluntarily submitted
by a visitor.&nbsp; Visitors may choose to submit personal information to enter
contests, to obtain information or submit a comment, to register for a loyalty
program or chat room, or to place an order.&nbsp; We make a special effort to
advise children to get parental permission before providing information or
ordering anything on-line, and urge parents to supervise their children's on-line
use. We ask children to let us know if they are under 13; if they are, we ask
for the name of a parent and make an effort to contact them to determine if the
child has permission to provide information to us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have special
policies in place for children under 13.&nbsp; Unless you see a “Special
Note to Parents” link on our home page, we do not knowingly collect any
personal information from children at this site.<o:p>

Providing personal information is up to you, our visitor. We will collect
personally identifiable information to enter you in contests and notify you of
results, to e-mail you with updates and news, to respond to your questions or
comments, to register you for certain features, and to send out brochures and
other information on our products.&nbsp; We ask visitors providing e-mail
addresses to let us know if they would like further information or updates from
our site; only those who request it will receive follow-up e-mail or other
communications from us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also ask if you would like to receive
information about other products available from members of our family of
companies.&nbsp; Only those over 13 who expressly ask to receive such
information online will get it. We also offer visitors an "opt-out"
option at any time they wish to cease receiving e-mails or other information
from us.&nbsp; <o:p>

</b></p>
We use "cookie" technology and IP addresses only to obtain non-personal
information from on-line visitors to provide them with the best possible
personalized on-line experience. To do this we do keep track of the type of
browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape) and operating system (e.g., Windows,
Macintosh) used by the visitor, and the domain name of the visitor's Internet
service provider.&nbsp; We also track the total number of visitors to our site
in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our site; personally
identifiable information is not extracted in this process.&nbsp; This helps us
keep our site fresh and interesting to the majority of our visitors.&nbsp;
Cookie technology also helps us deliver content tailored to a visitor’s
interests.&nbsp; You may disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when
cookies are being sent.&nbsp; If you do disable cookies, we may be unable to
optimize your visit to our site.<o:p>
