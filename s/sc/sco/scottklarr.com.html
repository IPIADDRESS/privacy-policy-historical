<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>What Information Is Collected</h3>
	<p>When you subscribe, you will be asked to provide your name, email address, and age, and your geographical location will be recorded based off your IP address.</p>

<h3>How Is It Used?</h3>
	<p>Your information is used solely for me to analyse my audience as a whole to determine the type of content I write and include in my newsletters. Your information will <strong>never</strong> be sold, leased, or available for any 3rd party. In fact, I personally will be the only one who even has access to the database.</p>

<h3>Abuse</h3>
	<p>Many newsletters will collect your "subscription approval" with shady methods basically allowing them to legally spam you. I hate spam just as much as you do and so I do not condone or take part in any sort of those activities. I pursue to maintain the quality of my newsletter by not selling any ad space in my newsletters, and by allowing easy unsubscribing that takes place immediately; not days, weeks, or even months like those shady guys. I will occasionally promote programs and products, but they are only when I feel that it is something beneficial to readers. You will not get a pile of ads from me!</p>
