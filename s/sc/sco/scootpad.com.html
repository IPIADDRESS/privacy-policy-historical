				  		<h5>Effective date: 1st November, 2016</h5><br>
				  		<p>
						We at ScootPad Corporation ("ScootPad," "we," "us," "our") know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. By accessing or using the Services (including without limitation the mobile version of the ScootPad.com website (the "Mobile Site") and the ScootPad mobile application(s) available via the Apple App Store and the Android Marketplace (collectively, the "Mobile Application"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. Remember that your use of ScootPad's Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Service, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use here without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Service.
						Please read on to learn more about how we collect and use your information; if you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy practices, please send us a detailed message to <a href="mailto:info@ScootPad.com">info@ScootPad.com</a>.
						</p></div>				
						
						<div class="row">
				  		<h5>What does this privacy policy cover?</h5><p>
						This Privacy Policy explains how ScootPad collects and uses information from its Services users, including our treatment of personally identifiable information. This policy does not apply to websites or practices of companies that ScootPad does not own or control, or to individuals that ScootPad does not employ or manage, including providers of Publisher Software.
						</p></div>				
						
						<div class="row">
				  		<h5>How is children's personal information treated?</h5><p>
						When we use the term "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we are referring to personally identifiable information of individual, non-student registrants of the Services. References to "Children's Personal Information" only apply to personally identifiable information of users who have registered for the Services as minor students (i.e., students under the age of 18). General references to "information" apply to all users.
						COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. ScootPad does NOT collect, request or allow any student (not just those under 13) to save or share any personally identifiable information. We only allow student's school, district, and/or teacher to enter a student's first name (last name is optional) for identifying the student within a classroom. If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn we have received any personal information from a student under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@ScootPad.com">info@ScootPad.com</a>						
						</p></div>				
						
						<div class="row">
				  		<h5>What information does ScootPad display or collect?</h5><p>
						a.	Information You Provide to Us
						We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Services, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way. This information may include, without limitation, Personal Information such as your name, user name, email address, phone number, profile picture, school affiliation and location, billing and payment information, and any other information necessary for us to provide our Services. If you are a student, the only Children's Personal Information we require is their first name (last name is optional). If you are a teacher, and you use our referral service to tell another teacher about our Services, we will ask you for that teacher's name and email address.
						b.	Information Collected Automatically
						We receive and store certain types of usage information whenever you interact with the Services; this information is not Personal Information or Children's Personal Information. For example, ScootPad automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, ScootPad cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your activity on the Services, and the number and frequency of visitors to our site and its components.
						When you download our Mobile Application, we automatically collect information on the type of device, name and version of the operating system, name and version of the application, whether the currently logged in user is a teacher, student, or other user type, the numerical mobile device user ID, as well as actions performed by the user in accessing the Mobile Application ("Mobile Usage Information," which is considered part of "usage information" as described above). However, we do not ask you for, access or track any geographic-location-based information from your mobile device (i.e., any information regarding where your mobile device is located on the globe at a particular time) at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Applications. For clarity, this does not prevent us from asking you what school you are affiliated with.
						We also use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Application and Mobile Site on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the Mobile Application, the events that occur within the Mobile Application, aggregated usage information, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from; this information is considered Mobile Usage Information.
						Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer or mobile device to enable our systems to recognize your computer or device and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. ScootPad cookies do not collect Personal Information or Children's Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information or Children's Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your user name or email address is. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you may not be able to log in or use many of the Services' most attractive features without cookies enabled. Our partners, affiliates, and service providers may also transmit cookies to your computer or device, to help provide you with an optimal online experience. For example, if you are playing a learning game offered by a Publisher, that Publisher may transmit cookies to you, allowing you to save your game history. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy and we do not have access or control over such cookies.
						The Services may also contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how the Services are used.
						</p></div>				
						
						<div class="row">
				  		<h5>What does ScootPad use my information for?</h5><p>
						a.	Generally
						When you use the Services, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels, depending on the category of user ("User Category") you are registered as, and as permitted by the functionality of the Services. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and allows users to set up a user account and profile through the Services.
						b.	Personal Information
						The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information and services, customizing your experience, and communicating with you about the Services.
						c.	Children's Personal Information
						We use the Children's Personal Information for creating your individual account (which will identify you within your Limited Access Groups), customizing your experience, and for sending you notifications via the Services from your teacher, school, district, fellow Limited Access Group members, and from ScootPad (regarding your use of the Services) ("Notifications"). Please note that your parent or guardian, as well as an administrator from your school and/or district, can view all activity and content associated with your student account, including your Children's Personal Information.
						d.	Your email address
						If you provide us your email address, we may send you email communications. Web beacons may also be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails (and which links within those emails) have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you are a student, we will only use your email address to send you Notifications. To opt out of receiving emails from us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@ScootPad.com">info@ScootPad.com</a>. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us via email, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services. Our Privacy Policy might change from time to time and upon such change you will be prompted online with a new consent, i.e., requiring you to click "I agree" before continuing to use the Services.
