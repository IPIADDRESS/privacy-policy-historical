IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE you are not allowed to participate in the Scooter Software forums, or to provide any personal information on our site.

<h3>Forum Registration</h3>
<p>Scooter Software encourages users who want to participate in the Scooter Software support forums to register.&nbsp;
In order to register, you must provide us with a username (which does not have to be your real name), password and a valid email address.&nbsp;
This allows us to protect our community from abusive postings and provides a verifiable point of contact should legal questions arise.&nbsp;
At any time, you have the ability to keep your email address hidden from other users by selecting that option within your user profile.

<p>
When you register, you have the option of providing some additional information such as occupation, interests, and homepage URL.&nbsp;
This optional information is made available to other bulletin or message board users to foster a sense of community.&nbsp;
If you have any concerns about providing this information, simply leave the fields blank and your registration will still be processed.
</p>

<h3>Ordering Online</h3>
<p>When you place an online order, we need to know your name, email address, phone number, billing address and credit card details.&nbsp;
This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.

<p>
Our website offers the use of a secure server.&nbsp;
The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.&nbsp;
The customer data and orders we collect are protected against unauthorized access.
