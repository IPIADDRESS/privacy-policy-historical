<p>Scooter Software encourages users who want to participate in the Scooter Software support forums to register.&nbsp;
In order to register, you must provide us with a username (which does not have to be your real name), password and a valid e-mail address.&nbsp;

When you register, you have the option of providing some additional information such as occupation, interests, and homepage URL.&nbsp;

This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.

Our website offers the use of a secure server.&nbsp;
The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.&nbsp;
