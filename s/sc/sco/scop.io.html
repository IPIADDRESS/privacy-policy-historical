				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business 

assets of Company. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, or in the 

good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or 

protect the rights, property or safety of our Company, employees, customers, or the public. Other than as described 

above, Company does not sell or rent information about its customers to third parties. <br>
<br><br>

<br><br>

<h5>About Cookies <br></h5>
<br><br>

When you visit Company’s Site, a text file called a cookie is placed in the browser directory of your computer's hard 

drive. A cookie is information that a website can store on your web browser and later retrieve. The information that 

cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit, your registration information and your navigational and 

licensing information. It allows the web browser to recognize the pages you have been to when you are visiting the 

Site, and allows you to quickly return to viewed pages. We may also use "Web beacons" that monitor your use of 

our sites. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web 

page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that 

downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on 

which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that 

server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, Web beacons let us know whether you received and 

opened our e-mail. <br>
<br><br>

On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if 

you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the 

cookies/Web beacons. <br>
<br><br>

By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons as described 

herein. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other Web site. Additionally, by setting 

your Web browser to display HTML e-mails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some Web 

beacons. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of our 

sites can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling 

cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content. <br>
<br><br>

<h4>Security Of Our Data <br></h4>
<br><br>

Whenever you submit an order to Company, you can do so over a secure (i.e., encrypted) connection. This 

ensures that your personal information is not at risk. Additionally, we encrypt your credit card information and store 

it in a secure location, which can be accessed only by authorized personnel. As no method of transmission over the 

internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, while Company uses commercially reasonable methods 

to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that it is absolutely security. In the unlikely event that an 

unauthorized third party compromises Company’s security measures, Company will not be responsible for any 

damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized third party’s ability to view, use or disseminate your 

information.<br>
<br><br>

<h5>Reviewing, Updating or Correcting Your Information <br> </h5>

accuracy, or (3) correct, supplement or modify your information, you may either select the Contact Us page as set 

forth above, or make a written request to info@scopio.io [insert email address]. <br>
<br><br>

no responsibility for the policies or practices of linked sites.  <br>

policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and consent to having your data transferred to and processed in the United
