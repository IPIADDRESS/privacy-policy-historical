			</h2>
		</div>
		<h3>Your Privacy is Important</h3>
		<p>Privacy and security are as important to Scottrade as the timely and accurate 
			execution of trades. This Privacy Policy and Security Statement describes how we 
			protect your personal and financial information that we collect in the course 
			of providing our financial services.</p>
		<p></p>
		<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
		<p>We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Information gathered from applications, forms and other information you provide 
				us (for example, your name, address, social security number, assets, 
				liabilities, and income);</li>
			<li>
				Information about your transactions and your account experience, including your 
				account balances, trading activity, and payment history;</li>
			<li>
				Information from consumer reporting agencies regarding your creditworthiness 
				and credit history; and</li>
			<li>
				Information from other outside sources regarding their employment, credit, or 
				other relationship with you, or verifying representations made by you to them, 
				such as your employment history, loan or credit card balances, etc.</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
		<h3>Information We Disclose and To Whom We Disclose Information</h3>
		<p>Scottrade does not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our 
			customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>For example, we disclose information, as permitted by law, to nonaffiliated 
			companies that work for us in providing financial services to you. These 
			companies include those who prepare statements of your account, transaction 
			confirmations, and credit reports. These companies are required to sign strict 
			confidentiality agreements with Scottrade.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>In addition, we disclose information, as permitted or required by law, to 
			government and regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange 
			Commission (SEC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We will make 
			disclosures to comply with a legal summons, court order, subpoena or similar 
			legal process, a fraud investigation, audit, or examination.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Finally, we are permitted to disclose information if you have provided your 
			consent.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Scottrade does not sell or rent personal information to any third party.</p>
		<p></p>
		<h3>Confidentiality and Security Procedures</h3>
		<p>We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those 
			employees who need to know such information to provide services to you. We 
			maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with 
			federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Scottrade offers a secure server and a password-protected environment. Personal 
			information is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.SSL encodes 
			and decodes the transmission of your personal information to prevent the 
			interception by another party. This transmission can be done on your Scottrade 
			website at 128-bit encryption… currently the most powerful available. By viewing 
			the URL/address/location line of your browser, you can determine if you are in 
			a secure mode by looking for https://. (In contrast http:// would represent a 
			non-secure transmission.)</p>
		<p></p>
		<h3>Use of “Cookies”</h3>
		<p>Cookies are used on our website to help us monitor traffic patters and see how 
			the user navigates through our site. Scottrade cookies are used for internal 
			purposes and are not used to collect disseminate personal information to any 
			third party. Cookies you may establish with companies whose sites are linked to 
			Scottrade are not the responsibility of Scottrade and you should review their 
			policy on cookies.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Scottrade will provide notice of our privacy policy annually, as long as you 
			maintain an account with us. Scottrade reserves the right to make changes on 
			this policy. You can always review our current policy online at www.scottrade.com, or contact us for a copy at
