    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. You can provide us 
      with as much, or as little, personal information as you feel comfortable 
      with. We use the information we collect to make your experience 
      using Scoot a rewarding one.</p>
    <p>The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination 
      practices for Scoot at http://www.scoot.co.uk</p>
    <p>Moreover, however you use Scoot, our data collection and usage 
      policy allows you to control the personal information you give to 
      us and what we can do with it. In this way your privacy is guaranteed.</p>
    <p>We use your <span class="abbr" title="Internet Protocol">IP</span> address to help diagnose problems with our server, 
      and to administer our Web site. Your <span class="abbr" title="Internet Protocol">IP</span> address is used to gather 
      broad demographic information. This information will not include

    <p>We aim to build your trust and confidence in Scoot and we will 
      not hold or use your personal details without your permission.</p>
    <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
    <p>A cookie is a data file that certain web sites write to your computer's 
      hard drive when you visit such sites. Our website uses cookies to 
      log search types and frequency. We use cookies to deliver content 
      specific to your interests and to safeguard our information from 
      illegal theft and data mining. We use this data on an anonymous 
      basis and we do not correlate this information with personal data 
      of any user.</p>
    <p>Most web site browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can 
      usually change your browser settings to display a warning before 
      accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies. However, if you choose 
      to disable the receipt of cookies from our web site, you may not 
      be able to use certain features of Scoot.</p>
    <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
    <p>We only collect information that personally identifies you or allows 
      us to contact you with your permission for example your name, address, 
      email address, and telephone number.</p>
    <p>We will also collect data when you request products and services 
      so that we can tailor Scoot to your specific needs. For example, 
      if you are a regular user of our Cinema Guide and you have given 
      us permission to contact you by email, we may send you information 
      of any cinema-related competitions or promotions that we run.</p>
    <p>We also monitor general call centre requests, web site traffic, 
      and user opinions to help us to continually improve Scoot.</p>
    <h2>Why do we collect this information?</h2>
    <p>We collect personal information to provide you with the most relevant 
      service possible. This means in terms of related products and services, 
      and targeted advertising, you only receive information you are interested 
      in.</p>
    <h2>How do we use personal information?</h2>
    <p>We use personal information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To understand more about you so that we can tailor Scoot whenever you access it.</li>
      <li>To summarise usage behaviour for advertisers and partners, and to describe our service and performance. 
        This is not based on individual behaviour but is generic.</li>
      <li>To improve Scoot.</li>
      <li>For other personalised value-added services to which you have specifically subscribed to.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information 
      as set out in this policy. If we change our privacy policy we will 
      post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages 
      of the website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect 
      and how we use it at all times. Continued use of Scoot will mean 
      that you agree to any such changes. Owing to the global nature of 
      the Internet infrastructure, the information you provide may be 
      transferred in transit to countries outside the European Economic 
      Area that do not have similar protections in place regarding your 
      data and its use as set out in this policy. By submitting your information 
      you consent to these transfers.</p>
    <h2>What information is collected automatically?</h2>
    <p>Our web servers automatically collect information about a site 
      user's <span class="abbr" title="Internet Protocol">IP</span> address, browser type, and referrer by reading this information 
      from the user's browser (information provided by every user's browser). 
      This information is collected in a database and used (in an aggregated, 
      anonymous manner) in our internal analysis of traffic patterns within 
      our web site.</p>
    <p>This information is automatically logged by most web sites.</p>
    <h2>How do we offer links to third party websites?</h2>
    <p>This site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible 
      for, without limitation, the privacy practices or the accuracy, 
      relevance, copyright compliance, legality, decency of any content 
      or services contained in such websites which are not directly controlled 
      by us. You acknowledge that the search results may contain links 
      to websites and contents that contain offensive or objectionable 
      material. We will not be responsible if the search results reveal 
      such objectionable or offensive content and you release us from 
      all liability in respect of the same. We reserve the right to disable 
      links from third party websites to Scoot.</p>
    <p>You should read the terms and conditions of use of any third party 
      website carefully before using that site or proceeding with any 
      online or offline transaction with that third party. Your correspondence 
      or business dealings with, or participation in the promotions of, 
      third parties found on or through Scoot, including payment and delivery 
      of related goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties 
      or representations associated with such dealings (including any 
      implied terms) are solely between you and such third parties.</p>
    <p>The inclusion of a link to a third party’s site does not 
      imply endorsement by us of the third party, its site, or any goods, 
      services, information or content featured on or available from that 
      site. We exclude its liability for inter alia:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The failure of a third party site to comply with applicable laws or regulations from time to time</li>
      <li>Any goods, services or content you acquire or access on a third party site</li>
      <li>Any damage, loss, cost or expense arising from: any link to or from a third party site on Scoot, any 
         third party content on Scoot, any third party content on Scoot or your use of a third party site.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not give any warranties or representations as to the security 
      of any information you might be requested to give to any third party, 
      and you irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such 
      sites and third party content.</p>
    <h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
    <p>The internet is not a secure medium. However, in order to prevent 
      unauthorised access, we use strict security procedures in the storage 
      and disclosure of information that you have given to us. We use 
      all reasonable endeavours to ensure the security of personal data 
      stored on our system.</p>
    <p>All your personal information is password protected and only certain 
      customers who have purchased certain specific products from us have 
      limited password protected access to their own information.</p>
    <h2>What about sensitive personal information?</h2>
    <p>Sensitive personal information such as religious beliefs, details 
      on mental/physical health, etc will be not stored by us or used 
      in any way other than for the immediate search taking place. For 
      example, if you search for a restaurant that has disabled access, 
      we will not store this information for future use.</p>
    <h2>What choice do we offer in relation to the collection, use and distribution of personal information?</h2>
    <p>When you register, or when you give us your personal details while 
      using Scoot, you acknowledge and accept that your information may 
      be used for marketing activities, or to receive additional offers 
      and information from us and/or third parties. This is called “permission 
      marketing”. You can amend your permission marketing status 
      with us so as not to receive information tailored to your needs 
      by advising us of that wish.</p>
    <h2>Do we share information?</h2>
    <p>We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to 
      any person or company except where you have given us permission 
      to do so, or if the law requires it, or where in good faith we believe 
      such action is necessary to fulfil the service.</p>
    <h2>What happens if we sell the Scoot business?</h2>
    <p>If this business is sold or integrated with another business your 
      details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers 
      and their advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business.</p>
    <h2>In summary</h2>
    <p>We want to make your Scoot experience a good one. Your privacy 
      is important. We want you to feel happy about the information you 
      are giving us and to be able to retain control over the way it is used.</p>
