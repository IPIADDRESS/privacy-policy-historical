<h1>Scholastic’s Online Privacy Policy</h1>



The following policy applies to the SCHOLASTIC.COM and SCHOLASTIC NETWORK sites.<p>

Scholastic is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its online visitors.  This policy statement provides our visitors (e.g., parents, teachers and children) with an overview of the measures we have taken to provide a safe environment for everyone.</p><p>


<b>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</b></p><p>

We only collect personally identifiable information from our visitors when our visitors voluntarily submit such information and we always request that children ask their parents or teachers for approval before sending us any personally identifiable information.  We may request such personally identifiable information in connection with our contests, sweepstakes, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, chats, bulletin boards, requests for suggestions, visitors’ requests for free products or services (such as our magazines), and visitors’ requests for additional information.  For example, we may collect the following personally identifiable information: the visitor’s name, e-mail address, age, and town.</p><p> 

In addition to Scholastic’s request that children ask their parents or teachers for approval before sending personally identifiable information to us, we also recommend that parents and teachers become involved in monitoring and supervising their children’s online activities, and recommend that parents and teachers become sophisticated in the availability and use of  commercially available software and other tools that may enhance children’s online experiences in manners that reflect the preferences of parents and teachers.</p><p>

Unless we indicate otherwise, personally identifiable information will be used solely by Scholastic or its agents for internal purposes, and will not be sold or otherwise transferred to third parties.</p><p>


<b>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND THE USE OF COOKIE TECHNOLOGY</b></p><p>

We collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of  a software technology called "cookies", and through our visitor’s voluntary submissions to us and/or upon our request.  By non-personally identifiable information, we are referring to information about our visitor’s browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), operating systems (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), Internet service providers (e.g., AOL or NET.COM) and other similar information which we track in aggregate form.  This means that the non-personally identifiable information that we track is anonymous and will never be identified with or lead us back to any of our visitors.  Cookie technology also helps us to know how many people visit us and where visitors go on our sites.  Among other things, this non-personally identifiable information allows us to know which areas are favorites, which areas need a bit of improvement, or what technologies and Internet services are being used by our visitors so that we may continually improve our visitor’s online experiences.</p><p>
<b> SECURITY
</b></p><p>

Scholastic ensures that all information, personally and non-personally identifiable information, that it receives via the Internet is secure against unauthorized access.  This information is kept in a safe and secure system isolated from direct connection to the Internet.  This means that no eyes but ours will ever see the information that our visitors send to us, unless we indicate otherwise.  </p><p>


<b>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</b></p><p>

Visitors will find links from SCHOLASTIC.COM and SCHOLASTIC NETWORK to independently owned, controlled and/or managed World Wide Web sites whose content we have found of possible interest to our visitors.  In many cases, the links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites.  While we initially visit these sites to which we directly link, please note that we do not control the content that appears on these sites and such content may be constantly changing.  We recommend that children check with their parents or teachers before clicking off to any new sites.</p><p>

Please note that we may revise our above policy as the content on our sites continue to change.</p><p>

We hope that you enjoy and feel comfortable exploring our sites.

<h1>Scholastic's Online Privacy Policy</h1>


The following policy applies to the SCHOLASTIC.COM site.<p>

Scholastic is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its online visitors. This policy statement provides our visitors (e.g., parents, teachers and children) with an overview of the 
measures we have taken to provide a safe environment for everyone.
</p><p>


<b>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</b></p><p>
We only collect personally identifiable information from our visitors 13 years old or above when such visitors voluntarily submit such information.  We do not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 without first obtaining verifiable parental consent unless we only use such information to:  (1) obtain parental consent or provide parents with notice; (2) respond directly on a one-time basis to a child's specific request; (3) respond more than once to a child's specific request along with providing parental notice of such use; (4) link a child's submission to a classroom activity through the use of a password provided by such child's teacher; or (5) enable a child to send a postcard, provided that we do not retain any related information.  The consent and notification process mentioned above gives parents the ability to let us know if they do not want us to make further use of the personally identifiable information we have collected from their child. </p><p>  

We consider the following to be personally identifiable information:  first and last name, email address, street address, phone number, and/or social security number.  We may request such personally identifiable information from children in connection with our contests, sweepstakes, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, classroom activities, requests for suggestions, and visitors' requests for free products, services (such as our magazines) or additional information, so that we can contact a winner, answer questions or requests, and fulfill orders.  Unless we indicate otherwise, personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by Scholastic or its agents for internal purposes and will not be sold or otherwise transferred to third parties.  </p><p>

<b>FOR PARENTS</b></p><p>
There are many activities on the Scholastic site that children can participate in and enjoy without having to share personally identifiable information.  For those activities that require personally identifiable information, such as contests and sweepstakes, Scholastic will not condition a child's participation in an activity on that child disclosing more personally identifiable information than is necessary to administer the activity.  In the situation where we require verifiable parental consent, Scholastic will notify the respective parent of our privacy policy and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personally identifiable information from a child unless one of the exceptions discussed above apply.  Parents can request review, correct, update or have deleted their child's personally identifiable information from Scholastic's database by sending us an email to info_update@scholastic.com. </p><p>

We strongly recommend that parents and teachers become involved in monitoring and supervising their children's online activities, and recommend that parents and teachers become sophisticated in the availability and use of commercially available software and other tools that may enhance children's online experiences in manners that reflect the preferences of parents and teachers.</p><p>

<b>FOR TEACHERS</b></p><p>
There are many activities on the Scholastic site that are for teachers, which enable teachers to add another dimension to their classroom and students' activities.  In order to create such online classroom activities, we will collect personally identifiable information from teachers and have teachers provide a password to their students so that students can publish materials online and do other activities online in connection with their class through the use of such password.  With respect to the teacher's personally identifiable information that we collect, we may use such information to provide teachers with information about materials, activities or other things which may be of interest to them, including products or services of third parties. </p><p>

<b>FOR KIDS </b></p><p>
Please do not give out your full name, email address, home address, telephone number or any other personal information that would enable someone to contact you either online or offline, without first asking your parent or guardian for permission.  Sometimes on our site we will ask you for your first name and email address along with your parent's email or home address.  We do this so that we can contact your parent to let them know that we have collected this information from you.  </p><p>


<b>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND THE USE OF COOKIE TECHNOLOGY</b></p><p>
We collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of a software technology called "cookies", and through our visitor's voluntary submissions to us and/or upon our request. By non-personally identifiable information, we are referring to information about our visitor's browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), operating systems (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), Internet service providers (e.g., AOL or NET.COM) and other similar information which we track in aggregate form.  We also collect the following non-personally identifiable information in connection with content submissions, games, classrooms and bulletin boards: first name only and first initial of last name, state, age and grade.  The non-personally identifiable information that we track is anonymous and will never be identified with or lead us back to any of our visitors. </p><p>

Cookie technology helps us to know how many people visit us and where visitors go on our site. Cookies are small bits of information we send to your computer.  Among other things, this non-personally identifiable information allows us to know which areas are favorites, which areas need a bit of improvement, or what technologies and Internet services are being used by our visitors so that we may continually improve our visitor's online experiences. </p><p>


<b>USE OF IP ADDRESSES</b></p><p>
We collect IP addresses to obtain aggregate information on the use of Scholastic.Com.  An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by a Web server when you're on the web.  When you are on our site, we have a back-end server which logs your computer's IP address.  We only use the information we find out from tracking IP addresses in the aggregate, such as how many users entered a specific area of our site, and not to track a specific IP address to identify an individual user.  However, we may use such information to identify a user if we feel that there are or may be potential be safety and/or security issues.</p><p>

<b>SECURITY </b></p><p>
Scholastic ensures that all information, personally and non-personally identifiable information, that it receives via the Internet is secure against unauthorized access. This information is kept in a safe and secure system isolated from direct connection to the Internet. This means that no eyes but ours will ever see the information that our visitors send to us, unless we indicate otherwise.
</p><p>

<b>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</b></p><p>
Visitors will find links from SCHOLASTIC.COM to independently owned, controlled and/or managed World Wide Web sites whose content we have found of possible interest to our visitors. In many cases, but not always, the links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. While we initially visit these sites to which we directly link, please note that we do not control the content that appears on these sites and such content may be constantly changing. We recommend that children check with their parents or teachers before clicking off to any new sites. </p><p>

Please note that we may revise our above policy as the content on our sites continues to change. </p><p>
