<b>SCHOLASTIC SHOPPING GUARANTEE</b><br><br>
The Scholastic Shopping Guarantee protects you while you shop at Scholastic.com, so that you never have to worry about credit card safety.  You pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at Scholastic's online stores.
<br>
<br>
<b>Why are we so safe?</b><br>
Scholastic uses secure server software over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line to protect your credit card information. It encrypts all of your personal and credit card information so that this information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system, and once it is received, it is stored in a location not accessible via the Internet.

<b>More Guarantee Details</b><br>
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of unauthorized charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50, Scholastic will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50. Note that, in the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
