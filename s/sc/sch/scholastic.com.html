	<b>PRIVACY NOTICE</b><br>
	<p>The following policy applies to the SCHOLASTIC.COM site.</p>
	<p>Scholastic is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its online visitors. This policy statement provides our visitors (e.g., parents, teachers, and children) with an overview of the measures we have taken to provide a safe environment for everyone.</p>

	<p><b>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</b></p>
	<p>We only collect personally identifiable information from our visitors 13 years old or above when such visitors voluntarily submit such information.</p>
	<p>We do not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 without first obtaining verifiable parental consent, unless we only use such information to:  (1) obtain parental consent or provide parents with notice; (2) respond directly on a one-time basis to a child's specific request; (3) respond more than once to a child's specific request along with providing parental notice of such use; (4) protect the safety of a child; or (5)  comply with legal requirements.  The consent and notification process mentioned above gives parents the ability to let us know if they do not want us to make further use of the personally identifiable information we have collected from their child.</p>
	  <p>We consider the following, among other things, to be personally identifiable 
        information: first and last name, e-mail address, street address and phone 
        number. We may request such personally identifiable information from children 
        in connection with our contests, sweepstakes, games, surveys, forums, 
        subscription registrations, content submissions, classroom activities, 
        requests for suggestions, and visitors' requests for free products, services 
        (such as our magazines) or additional information, so that we can contact 
        a winner, answer questions or requests, and fulfill orders. Unless we 
        indicate otherwise, personally identifiable information from children 
        under the age of 13 will be used solely by Scholastic, co-operators of 
        any customized features on our site such as Scholastic Global Classport, 
        or Scholastic's agents for internal purposes and will not be sold or otherwise 
        transferred to third parties. To read the Scholastic Global Classport 
        privacy policy, <a href="/toolkit/classport/privacy.htm">click here</a>. 
      </p>
	<p>It is Scholastic's policy never to post on its site, more than a child's first name, first initial of last name, state, and age or grade.</p> 

	<p><b>FOR PARENTS</b></p>
	<p>There are many activities on the Scholastic site that children can participate in and enjoy without having to share personally identifiable information.</p>  
	<p>For those activities that require personally identifiable information, such as contests and sweepstakes (in compliance with the Federal Trade Commission's Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), Scholastic will not condition a child's participation in an activity on that child disclosing more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to administer the activity.  For certain online activities, we require verifiable parental consent before collecting or using a child's personally identifiable information. With these activities, Scholastic will notify the respective parent of our privacy policy and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personally identifiable information from a child, unless one of the exceptions discussed above applies.</p>  
	<p>Parents can request to review or have deleted their child's personally identifiable information from Scholastic's records, and refuse to permit further use of a child's information by printing, completing, and returning <a href="/parents/inforequest/index.htm">this letter</a> by fax or regular mail to the specified address.</p>
	<p>In some areas of our site, we collect personally identifiable information from parents.  We use the personally identifiable information that parents provide to us to customize the content on Scholastic.com to parents' current and future needs.  We also use this personally identifiable information to provide parents, via e-mail or other means, with information about materials, activities, or other things that may be of interest to parents or their children, including products or services of third parties.  For these reasons, we may share such information with third parties who provide services to our site.  However, parents always have the opportunity to unsubscribe from any communication via e-mail if they choose to do so.</p>	

	<p><b>FOR TEACHERS</b></p>
	  <p>There are many activities on the Scholastic site that are for teachers, 
        which enable teachers to add another dimension to their classroom and 
        students' activities. In order to create such online classroom activities, 
        we will collect personally identifiable information from teachers and 
        have teachers provide a password to their students so that students can 
        publish materials online and do other activities online in connection 
        with their class through the use of such password. We will only enable 
        such passwords with the verifiable consent provided by teachers acting 
        on behalf of parents. We also have classroom activities such as Scholastic 
        Global Classport (<a href="/toolkit/classport/privacy.htm">click here</a> 
        for further details) where we collect prior consent from teachers on behalf 
        of parents in order for children 12 years old and under to participate.<!-- We also have classroom activities such as Scholastic Global Classport (<a href="http://teacher.scholastic.com/holiday/epals_tips.htm">click here for further details</a>) where we collect prior consent from parents through teachers in order for children 12 years old and under to participate. --></p>
	  <p>A teacher may revoke the consent she has provided on behalf of her students' 
        parents, or inquire about personally identifiable information that has 
        been collected from a student on Scholastic Global Classport, by returning 
        <a href="parents/inforequest/tchrequest.htm">this letter</a> to the specified 
        address.</p>
      <p>When teachers register with our site, we use their sign-in information, 
        which contains personally identifiable information, to ensure that only 
        the teacher who has signed in has access to his or her personal areas 
        of the site. For example, only registered teachers are permitted to administer 
        Class Homepages. Access to administer a teacher's Class Homepage is controlled 
        via that teacher's personal username and password, which was established 
        during the registration process.</p>	
	<p>We also use the personally identifiable information that teachers provide to us to customize the content on Scholastic.com to teachers' current and future needs.  In addition, we use teachers' personally identifiable information to provide teachers, via e-mail or other means, information about materials, activities or other things that may be of interest to teachers, including products or services of third parties.  For these reasons, we may share such information with third parties who provide services to our site.  However, teachers always have the opportunity to unsubscribe from any communication via e-mail if they choose to do so.</p>

	<p><b>FOR KIDS</b></p>
	<p>Remember to be smart online.  Do not give out your full name, e-mail address, home address, telephone number or any other personal information that would enable someone to contact you either online or offline, without first asking your parent or guardian for permission.  Sometimes on our site we will ask you for your first name and e-mail address along with your parents' e-mail or home address.  We do this so that we can contact your parents to let them know that you have communicated with us, and that we have collected this information from you.</p> 
	
	<p><b>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND THE USE OF COOKIE TECHNOLOGY</b></p>
	<p>We collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of a software technology called "cookies," and through our visitors' voluntary submissions to us and/or upon our request. By non-personally identifiable information, we are referring to information about our visitors' browsers (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), operating systems (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), Internet service providers (e.g., AOL or NET.COM) and other similar information which we track in aggregate form.  We also collect the following non-personally identifiable information in connection with content submissions, games, classrooms, and bulletin boards: first name only and first initial of last name, state, age, and grade.  The non-personally identifiable information that we track is anonymous and will never be identified with or lead us back to any of our visitors.</p>
	<p>Cookie technology helps us to know how many people visit us and where visitors go on our site. Cookies are small bits of information we send to your computer.  Among other things, this non-personally identifiable information allows us to know which areas are favorites, which areas need a bit of improvement, or what technologies and Internet services are being used by our visitors so that we may continually improve our visitors' online experiences.</p> 

	<p><b>USE OF IP ADDRESSES</b></p>
	<p>We collect IP addresses to obtain aggregate information on the use of Scholastic.com.  An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by a Web server when you're on the Web.  When you are on our site, we have a back-end server that logs your computer's IP address.  We only use the information we find out from tracking IP addresses in the aggregate, such as how many users entered a specific area of our site, and not to track a specific IP address to identify an individual user.  However, we may use such information to identify a user if we feel that there are or may be safety and/or security issues or to comply with legal requirements.</p>

	<p><b>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING SERVERS</b></p>
	<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.  These companies may use aggregate information (not including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, or any other personally identifiable information) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.privacychoices.org/">click here</a>.</p>

	<p><b>SECURITY</b></p>
	<p>Scholastic ensures that all information, personally and non-personally identifiable information, that it receives via the Internet is secure against unauthorized access. This information is kept in a safe and secure system isolated from direct connection to the Internet. This means that no eyes but ours will ever see the information that our visitors send to us, unless we indicate otherwise.</p> 
	<p>In some places on our sites, parents and teachers may be able to purchase items with the use of a credit card.  In such instances, Scholastic uses secure server software over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line, the latest technology to protect your credit card information.  SSL is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions.  It encrypts all of your credit card information so that the information from your credit card cannot be read as it travels over the Internet.</p>

	<p><b>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</b></p>
	<p>Visitors will find links from Scholastic.com to independently owned, controlled and/or managed World Wide Web or Internet sites whose content we have found of possible interest to our visitors. In many cases, but not always, the links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. While we initially visit these sites to which we directly link, please note that we do not monitor or control the content that appears on these sites and such content may be constantly changing. We recommend that children check with their parents or teachers before clicking off to any new sites, and we encourage all end users of Scholastic.com to read the privacy policies of all linked sites before navigating through them. </p> 
	<p>Please note that we may revise our above policy as the content on our sites continues to change.</p>
	<p>We hope that you enjoy exploring our sites.</p>
