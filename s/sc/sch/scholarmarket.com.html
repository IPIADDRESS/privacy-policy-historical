                Scholarmarket collects various types of   information from you to better meet your needs and to provide you with a more   relevant user experience. Some of this information is collected automatically   through cookies (a small text file placed on your computer) or other Internet   tracking technologies. The type of information your browser or Internet session   may automatically provide us with can include the browser you are using, your   Internet domain, the operating system on your computer, your IP address and the   URL you saw just before coming to the Scholarmarket site, the pages of the   site you visited and the URL of the page you visited upon leaving the site.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="bluetxt"> Scholarmarket may also contract with reputable third-party   advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may also use cookies or other measures to collect your non-personally identifiable   information.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="bluetxt">
                All personally identifiable information you   provide is maintained in confidence by Scholarmarket. There are instances,   however, in which your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable   information is shared with third parties, as described below. <br>
                <br>
                Your   non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of   Scholarmarket on an anonymous basis. <br>
                <br>
                When you request information   from Scholarmarket or any university affiliated on the website, we may   transfer that information within Scholarmarket or route your information to   university, across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other   countries or jurisdictions around the world, so that they may provide the   information on the program that you requested. <br>
                <br>
                We may also disclose   information to a third party who provides substantially similar services as the   original service about which you requested more information. In such situations,   we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be   aware that Scholarmarket is very careful in selecting companies with whom it   does business. <br>
                <br>
                In addition to the above situations where your   information may be shared with others, there is also the possibility that   Scholarmarket, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or   merged with, another company. In the event of such transaction, the acquiring   (or merging) company will have access to all collected personally identifiable   information. <br>
                <br>
                Finally, Scholarmarket may share your information as   necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law   enforcement officials.</p>
