    <h3>Usage of Schoology by Students</h3>
    <p>If a student is under the age of 13, a parent or legal guardian must give consent for the child to use Schoology.</p>
    <p>Schoology collects limited personal information from minor students only where that student’s school, district, or teacher has contracted with Schoology to collect personal information for the use and benefit of the learning environment.</p>
    <p>Schoology requires schools, districts, or teachers to obtain parental consent from parents.</p>
    <p>If you believe that a student’s school, district, or teacher has not required parental consent prior to our collection of any personal information, contact us at help@schoology.com.</p>

    <h3>Standard Provisions</h3>
    <p><b>If you are a student, the following provisions also apply:</b></p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p><b>If you are accessing Schoology as a Teacher, the following provisions also apply:</b></p>

      <li>You understand that your acceptance of these Terms indicates that you are agreeing to these Terms both on your own behalf as well as on behalf of your child or children who use Schoology. Children under 13 must not use Schoology until after a parent has accepted these Terms on their behalf.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Changes in this Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  </p>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to how we use your Personal Information or Personal Information collected from children under age 13, we will notify you, by email, by means of notice on our home page, and parents by email in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of the child's Personal Information.</p>

    <h3>Internet Privacy &amp; Security</h3>
    <p>Schoology and your school work together to protect the online privacy of all of your school community members that use Schoology, including students, parents, teachers, and administrators. Schoology information collection, security, and privacy policies have been authorized by your school or teacher, and Schoology strives to manage your school's internet services in a secure manner. For example, Schoology uses industry-standard technology called SSL (Secure Socket Layer).  SSL encrypts information transmitted across the internet to and from Schoology.  You will know that SSL is working when you see the presence of an image of a closed lock or solid key in the bottom bar of your browser window.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and “hacker-proof,” and Schoology cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information managed by the site, whether transmitted to Schoology by you, your school, or your teacher.  Schoology shall not be liable if a security breach occurs, if the site malfunctions, or if information is misused or mismanaged in any way to your detriment or the detriment of a third party, whether by Schoology, your school, your teacher, or an unauthorized third party.</p>

    <h3>Information Collection &amp; Use of your Personal Information</h3>
    <p>Schoology collects and analyzes data on how the service is used in the aggregate (how groups of people use Schoology) for the purpose of improving and enhancing its service. For example, Schoology might learn that school news and announcement pages receive a great deal of traffic, which might influence how this aspect of the service is delivered in the future. Schoology does not analyze information on how particular individuals use the service as part of general reporting procedures or in the usual course of business. However, information on individual usage of the system, including but not limited to individual IP addresses, may be analyzed on a case-specific basis to resolve a technical difficulty or to assist in resolving or investigating any misuse of the service; also, such individual usage information may be furnished to your school if your school requests such information to assist in the investigation of fraudulent, abusive, or criminal activity or any other use of Schoology that violates your school's rules or policies.</p>
    <p>In order to create an account, Schoology does require that all users create a screen name and password, which is stored on the site, and collects personal information such as name, address, email, or other information if necessary, depending on the needs of your school or the service. If you are a student and register to use the site you will be asked to provide an access code provided to you by your school administrator or teacher. We do not sell, share, rent or trade your personal information with any third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>If you wish to obtain a quote we request your name, email address, phone number, position, school, size of school, city and state/country.  We use this information to provide you with the best quote possible. </p>
    <p>A child's participation or access to an activity cannot be conditioned on her providing more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary for that activity. Parents have the right to refuse further contact with their child by the site and have access to their child's information to have it deleted by contacting the school administrator. </p>
    <p>Parents have the right to consent to the site's use of the child's Personal Information without having to consent to its disclosure of that information to third parties by contacting the school administrator.</p>
    <p>As required by your school as part of their information management efforts. For example, if your school uses a certain third-party company to manage their classroom scheduling and attendance system, necessary information may be shared with that company to assist in those administrative tasks.</p>
    <p>These information collection, management, and disclosure practices apply to parents, teachers, administrators, and students. If you are a parent, you agree that this is acceptable for you as well as any of your children that use Schoology. If you are a teacher, you agree that this is acceptable for you as well as any of your students that use Schoology.</p>
    <p>Schoology does not share, sell, rent or trade adult or children's personal information with third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>We may disclose your or your child’s personally identifiable information in connection with business transfers and purchases.
