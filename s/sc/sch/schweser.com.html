Policy\n\n_Last Revised: January 1, 2017_\n\nWelcome to the Website and Social Media Privacy Policy for the Kaplan Professional Education website (the \"Site\"), a service operated by DF Institute, LLC, doing business as Kaplan Professional Education (\"Kaplan,\" \"we,\" or \"us\"). This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site and not to other websites or services operated by Kaplan or its subsidiaries or affiliates.\n\nYour privacy is very important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. We understand that you should be in control of your personal information.  This Privacy Policy explains the manner in which we collect personal information from you and the purpose of that collection. This Privacy Policy is designed to ensure that you are aware of how your personal information is being used and to provide you with choices about that use. By visiting the Site or submitting your personal information, you accept the terms described in the Privacy Policy.\n\n**Social Media Privacy**\n\nKaplan will not require you to:\n* Disclose a user name or password for accessing personal social media;\n* Access personal social media in the presence of Kaplan’s employees or representatives; or\n* Divulge any personal social media information.\n\n**Collection of Personal Information You Provide.** We may collect and store personal information that can identify you, such as your name, postal address, email address (“Personal Information“), when voluntarily submitted by our visitors. We may collect and store any personal information you provide to us that may be contained in any video, comment, or other submission you upload or post to the Site. This might also include telephone number; your likeness; and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date, or other financial information). If sensitive information is collected, we will take appropriate efforts to comply with industry standards for the protection and proper disposal of all sensitive data, both online and offline. We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information.\n\nWhen you provide personal information to us, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.\n\n**Personal Information From Other Sources**. We may also periodically obtain personal information about you from other Kaplan businesses, business partners, contractors, and other third parties. Examples of information that we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and additional demographic information.\n\n#### Automated Information\n\n**Collection.** We use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your use of the Site.\n\n**Information collected automatically.** We automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our Site. This information includes, but is not limited to, your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see \"Cookies\" below), and the referring website address.\n\n**Cookies**. When you visit our Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to our Site and to personalize your online experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our Site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on our Site.\n\n**Other Technologies.** Like many websites, we may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons, site tags, clear GIFs, and other similar technologies, to collect and maintain information about your web-surfing activity when you are visiting this Site, other Kaplan sites, as well as other non-Kaplan sites. We also may include web beacons or pixels in advertisements and promotional e-mail messages to determine whether advertising or messages have been acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer our website visitors to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming, or other activities.\n\n**Do Not Track Practices.** Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, Kaplan currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.\n\n#### How We Use the Information We Collect\n\nWe may use information that we collect about you to:\n\n* Deliver the products and services that you have requested;\n* Manage your account and provide you with customer support;\n* Perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content, or products, services or content offered by others;\n* Communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone, and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us, other Kaplan companies, or other third parties;\n* Develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our Site and other sites;\n* Verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes;\n* Enforce our terms and conditions; and\n* Manage our business and perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.\n\n**Financial information.** We may use financial information or payment method to process payment for any purchases, subscriptions or sales made on our Site, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.\n\n#### Sharing with Third Parties\n\nWe do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with:\n\n* **Authorized Service Providers:** We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, delivering packages, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our website. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.\n* **Business Partners:** When you make purchases, reservations, or engage in promotions offered through our Site or our services, we may share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests, and/or sweepstakes. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant’s offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and other information to that merchant.\n* **Other Kaplan Businesses:** We may share information we collect, including personal information, with the Kaplan companies. Sharing information with our Kaplan companies enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that might interest you.\n* **Other Situations:**\n\t* We also may disclose your information in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion. When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, report, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud, or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Kaplan, its users, employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.\n\t* In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.\n\nAny third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling, and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.\n\n**Aggregated and Non-Personal Information.** We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and other Kaplan companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers, and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.\n\n**Your Ability to Choose**\nYou can let us know, upfront and at no cost, that you do not wish us to share your information with third parties for marketing purposes or to notify you about our own products and services and special offers by sending us a written request by email to feedback@kaplan.com, including the word “unsubscribe” in the subject line.\n\n**Links to Third-Party Websites**\nThere are a number of places on the Site or through our services where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the \"privacy\" link typically located at the bottom of the web page you are visiting.\n\n**User Submissions**\nWe may provide areas on our Site where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others; upload content (e.g., pictures, videos, audio files, etc.); and post comments or reviews of content found on the Site. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information.\n\n**Children’s Privacy**\nOur website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Should we learn that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete that information from our database.\n\n**Visiting Our Site from Outside the United States**\nThis Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on or via our Site from residents of the United States. If you are visiting our Site from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n**No Rights of Third Parties**\nThis Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.\n\n**Change to This Privacy Policy**\nFrom time to time, we may modify this Policy. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the \"Revised Date\" at the top of this Privacy Policy. By continuing to use our Site after we modify this Privacy Policy, you accept the new version of the Privacy Policy. Therefore, it is important that you read this page regularly to ensure you are familiar with the most updated Agreement. If you do not agree to the changes, you should not continue to use the Site and should instead contact us by emailing feedback@kaplan.com.\n\n**Questions About Data Collection and Processing**\nYou may ask questions about the data you have submitted through the Site by using the information below to contact us.\n\n**How to Contact Us**\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our information-handling practices, or if you would like to request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please contact us by email as follows:\n\nfeedback@kaplan.com\n\n**Security**\nWe care about protecting the security of your personal information, and we have implemented security procedures to protect the personal information that you provide to us. However, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used, or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy.\n\n**Review and Correction**\nYou may review and update the personal information you have provided to us by contacting us at feedback@kaplan.com or by writing
