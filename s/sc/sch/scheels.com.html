Scheels will not buy, sell, trade, or share information with any other company or individual unless one of the following exceptions applies:
</span></p>

<p><span class="arial12black2">
<span class="arial14boldblack">Third-party subcontractors:</span> Scheels may use outside companies to provide services such as sending emails. These companies are trusted by Scheels, and have agreed under contract to abide by the ethical standards set by Scheels. These companies, by law, cannot use your information in any way beyond what is necessary to carry out those services for Scheels.
</span></p>

<p><span class="arial12black2">
<span class="arial14boldblack">Credit Card Companies:</span> In order to process your online order, Scheels allows our bank to use your credit card information. Also, part of the process includes giving the information to your credit card company (Visa, MasterCard International) in order to verify your credit card.

<span class="arial14boldblack">What are cookies? Securing your information </span><br>
Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not tell us your personal information unless you provide the information by creating an account, or entering a contest. Cookies allow us to monitor the site usage, and easily make changes catered to your preferences. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies; however, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Our website also uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal credit information as it travels over the internet. SSL is the industry standard for secure online transactions. The use of SSL makes giving your credit card information online as safe as placing an order over the phone. Your security is important to us, and scheels.com NEVER accepts information given via phone or email.

<p><span class="arial12black2">
<span class="arial14boldblack">How can you access your information?</span><br>
Your account page shows the information. From this page, you can edit your password, email preferences, sports passions, and view your order history. You can change or edit your information as necessary. Stay Updated!
</span></p>

<p><span class="arial12black2">
Your password is the most important part of your account and should contain both letters and numbers. You should not share your password with anyone. Do not use common names, birthdates, pet names, or other things about you that can be easily guessed. We never close accounts without your request or ask you to verify information outside of the normal order process.
</span></p>

<p><span class="arial12black2">
<span class="arial14boldblack">Note to parents</span><br>
The site you are viewing is for all audiences. Scheels will never allow inappropriate content to be accessible through our website. Protecting children’s privacy on the internet is important to us and we fully abide by the Children’s online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). This restricts Scheels from collecting information from children under the age of 13, and we will delete the information if it has been provided to us.
