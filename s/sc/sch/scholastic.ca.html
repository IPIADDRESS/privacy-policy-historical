					<strong><em><u>Introduction</u></em></strong><br><br>
                  
				  Scholastic Canada has always had 
                  a profound respect for the privacy of its customers. We regard 
                  all information given to us as a very special trust. We have 
                  never sold or shared our customer lists with any other company 
                  or service, and we are determined to maintain this 
                  policy.<br><br>
				  
				  Scholastic Canada uses its 
                  customer lists to provide products and services to our 
                  customers and to keep them informed of any new products or 
                  services that are appropriate to their needs and that may be 
                  of interest to them.<br><br>
				  
				  We are very happy to assure our 
                  customers that we are conforming to all the requirements of 
                  Canada’s new privacy legislation, <i>The Personal Information 
                  Protection and Electronic Documents Act</i>.<br><br>
				  
				  To help you understand the ways 
                  in which Scholastic Canada respects and protects the 
                  information you share with us, we are pleased to provide the 
                  following description of our policies and 
practices:<br><br><br>
				  
				  <b>Personal 
                  information</b><br><br>
				  
				  In order to serve our customers 
                  with the right materials at the right levels, delivered to the 
                  right address, and to ensure that the financial relationship 
                  is correct and current, we need to have certain basic personal 
                  information on file. <br><br>
				  Personal information is the 
                  information we have that relates to you, our customer, as an 
                  individual. Personal information, beyond your name and school 
                  or business contact information, may include any or all of the 
                  following: a record of your purchases and payment method, 
                  alternate contact information and your account number (if 
                  applicable). For teachers, we may also retain information that 
                  you have provided to us relating to your classroom needs and 
                  the number of years you have been teaching.<br><br>
				  
				  We will only request information 
                  from you that relates directly to the products or services we 
                  are providing to you, and we will keep that information active 
                  only as long as the uses for which it has been collected are 
                  relevant to your needs.<br><br><br>
				  
				  <b>Consent</b><br><br>
				  
				  Scholastic Canada must obtain 
                  the consent of all the people whose name may be retained in 
                  our records to receive products or information. If the 
                  customer sends in a coupon or a form requesting our services, 
                  we accept that as implied consent. If we need information 
                  beyond that which the customer has indicated (in conducting a 
                  survey, for instance), we will request the explicit consent of 
                  the customer either verbally or in writing.<br><br>
				  
				  The customer can at any time 
                  withdraw consent to receive further information or products. 
                  We will remove the customer’s name as quickly as possible, 
                  but, owing to work that has been completed or scheduled, the 
                  name may not become inactive for up to three 
months.<br><br>
				  
				  It should be noted that from 
                  time to time Scholastic Canada may acquire from outside 
                  companies lists of customers who have consented to receive 
                  information. It may sometimes occur that a name that we have 
                  deleted on request from our files may appear on one of the 
                  lists we have acquired. In such a case the customer may have 
                  to request another deletion.<br><br><br>
				  
				  <b>Call monitoring and 
                  recording</b><br><br>
				  
				  In order to ensure a high level 
                  of customer service, and a sensitive treatment of customer 
                  concerns, our customer service calls are monitored and/or 
                  recorded on an ongoing basis for training purposes only. We do this to ensure the highest 
                  level of service to our customers and to enable our staff to 
                  improve their skills through practical mentoring and 
                  coaching.<br><br><br>
				  
				  <b>Employee 
                  commitment</b><br><br>
				  
				  Every one of our employees is 
                  committed to respecting the personal information we hold in 
                  our files. Each year our employees sign a letter obliging them 
                  to abide by the company policy relating to the proper use of 
                  personal information.<br><br><br>
				  
				  <b>Third party 
                  commitment</b><br><br>
				  
				  Whenever Scholastic Canada 
                  supplies data files to third party services such as printers 
                  or mailing houses, these companies sign a commitment to 
                  respect Scholastic Canada’s Code of Privacy and to utilize the 
                  lists only for the purposes Scholastic Canada specifies and 
                  not make any copies of the files. All data files remain the 
                  property of Scholastic Canada and must be returned to 
                  Scholastic Canada at the completion of the job.<br><br><br>
				  
				  <b>Uses of personal 
                  information</b><br><br>
				  
				  Scholastic Canada collects 
                  personal information for the following purposes:<br><br>
				  
				  </li><li>to make you 
                  aware of Scholastic Canada’s products and services that may be 
                  of interest to you. From time to time we have included other 
                  companies’ products and services in our offerings, but we do 
                  not make our list of names and addresses available to such 
                  other companies<br><br>
				  
				  </li><li>to provide 
                  you with fast accurate service and to provide us with the 
                  ability to reach you to resolve problems should they 
                  arise<br><br>
				  
				  </li></font><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to meet 
                  legal and regulatory requirements under federal and provincial 
                  regulations.<br><br><br>
				  
				  <b>Limitations on 
                  use</b><br><br>
				  
				  Scholastic Canada will not use 
                  your personal information for any purposes, other than those 
                  outlined above, unless we have asked your permission and have 
                  received your consent.<br><br>
				  
				  Scholastic Canada will remove 
                  personal information when it is no longer relevant for the 
                  uses for which it was gathered.<br><br>
				  
				  Scholastic Canada will delete 
                  your name from our mailing list following the receipt of your 
                  request by letter, fax, email or phone.<br><br><br>
				  
				  <b>Term</b><br><br>
				  
				  We will not retain personal 
                  information indefinitely. Generally a name is retained for two 
                  years after it has become inactive (no transactions against 
                  that name). Files are then destroyed or deleted, except for 
                  those on data tapes and financial records, which, in 
                  accordance with the law, have to be archived for seven years. 
                  Archived information is not accessed or used for operational 
                  or marketing purposes.<br><br><br>
				  
				  <b>Security</b><br><br>
				  
				  All information held by 
                  Scholastic Canada is subject to strict internal security to 
                  prevent unauthorized access and improper usage. Electronic 
                  records are subject to limited access by authorized personnel 
                  who must use passwords and other security measures. Print 
                  records of personal information are subject to physical 
                  protection such as locked rooms or cabinets, accessible only 
                  to authorized personnel.<br><br><br>
				  
				  <b>Access to 
                  information</b><br><br>
				  
				  As one of our customers, you 
                  have a right to know what information we are holding in 
                  respect to you, and you have the right to ensure that it is 
                  accurate.  On 
                  request, we will arrange to supply you with a printout of our 
                  files relating to your information. If you wish to verify your 
                  information, please send us a letter at the address included 
                  to the attention of the Privacy Officer. If you find errors or 
                  omissions, we will be pleased to make corrections.<br><br><br>
