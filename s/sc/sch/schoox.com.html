<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<h3>Last Updated June 2013</h3>
    <span class="texting2">

        <h1>General information</h1>
        <p>The Schoox services are offered in the United States and countries outside of the European
            Union by Schoox Inc., which is located at 8121 Bee Cave Rd, 78746 Austin, TX, United States
            of America, email  info@schoox.com (“Schoox Inc.”), and in countries within the European
            Union by Pheron, Ltd., a Greek corporation located at Koletti 25B, Thessaloniki, 54627 Greece
            (“Pheron”).  In countries outside the United States, the Service may be offered on one or more
            localized websites that may redirect to www.Schoox.com (together with any localized websites,
            the “Site”).  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, Schoox Inc. and Pheron are collectively referred
            to as “Schoox”, “we” or “us”.</p>
        <p>The following Privacy Policy governs our collection and handling practices of personal
            information of visitors and users of the pages and services of the Site. Specifically, it outlines
            the types of information that we gather about you while you are visiting and using the Site and
            the ways in which we use and don’t use that information.  As used herein, the term “personal
            information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name,
            telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, mailing address, test scores, grade point
            average, or credit card number), or information about that individual that is directly linked
            to personally identifiable information.  Personal information does not include “aggregate”
            information, which is data we collect about the use of our website or about a group or category
            of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been
            removed.  This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate
            information.  The terms “you,” “your,” “yours” and “User” refer to you, the user of this site.</p>
        <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you expressly consent to
            our handling of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you agree
            that your use of the Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our
            Terms of Use. From time to time, we may change our Privacy Policy, in which case we'll post the
            changes to this Privacy Policy on the Site. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such
            changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and
            subject to the terms of the Site’s Terms of Use.</p>
        <p>If you are under the age of 18, you may use the Site and submit personal information to us
            only with the consent of your parents or guardians. In all cases, if you are under the age of 18,
            please do not give your full name, email address, home address, telephone number or any other
            personally identifiable information that would enable someone to contact you either online or
            offline, without first asking your parent or guardian for permission.</p>
        <p>While children under the age of eighteen (18) may use the Site with parental consent, please
            be advised that this Site is not directed or otherwise promoted in any way for use by children
            under the age of thirteen (13).  We ask that any user under the age of thirteen (13) not submit any
            personal information to us or use the Site.  Any person who provides their information to the Site
            through the account registration page for new customers or any other part of the Site represents
            to us that he or she is thirteen (13) years of age or older.  Users who are under the age of eighteen
            (18) must obtain the consent of a parent or legal guardian before using the Site.</p>
        <h1>Links to other sites</h1>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected on the Site. The Site may contain
            links to third-party websites or resources, whose privacy policies and practices we do not control.
            Accordingly, we encourage you to read such third-party sites’ terms of use and privacy policies
            before using them, in order to understand whether and how they process data about your use
            thereof.  The above may apply in particular with respect to the feedback &amp; support features of the
            Site, which are provided with the help of UserVoice Inc. (uservoice.com).</p>
        <h1>Collection and use of personal information</h1>
        <p>We collect personal information for the reasons listed below to enable us to operate our
            business on a reasonable basis and to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized
            experience.</p>
        <p>In general, you may visit the Site without providing us with or revealing any personally
            identifiable information about yourself. However, if you choose to register with the Site, you will
            be required to provide us with certain personal information, as described below. By providing us
            with such personal information, you explicitly agree to our collection and use of such information
            as described in this Policy.</p>
        <p>When you register with the Site you provide us with two kinds of information: personal
            information you knowingly choose to disclose and Site use information collected by us as you
            interact with the Site.</p>
        <p>When you register with the Site, you provide us with your name, email address and, on an
            optional basis, with your gender, location, age, etc., as well as with information about your
            educational and professional background and interests. In any case, PLEASE NOTE that the
            name and other personal information you provide to us are automatically published on the Site
            as part of your profile, i.e. they become available to the other registered users of the Site to
            whom you have allowed access to your profile (via your privacy settings). The exception is for
            your email address, which is not published, provided however that you will need to provide
            it to UserVoice Inc. (uservoice.com), which helps us with the feedback &amp; support features of
            the Site, in case that you wish to submit a query, problem, etc. (see also under “Links to other
            sites” above).  Accordingly, if you do not wish to make the above information available to the
            other users of the Site, please either configure your  privacy settings accordingly and/or abstain
            from providing any optionally required data, or abstain entirely from registering with the Site.
            Similarly, when you submit reviews or ratings of any Site content such reviews and ratings will
            appear on the relevant content’s reviews as well as on your profile. If you do not wish such
            reviews and ratings to appear on your profile and/or on the content’s reviews, please set your
            privacy settings accordingly or abstain from submitting such reviews and ratings.</p>
        <p>When you enter the Site, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is
            gathered for all Site visitors. In addition, we may also use “cookies” or similar electronic tools
            to collect anonymous information, such as the date and time you accessed the Site, the pages
            you requested and visited, and the site you linked from to reach the Site. A cookie is a small text
            file that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing
            how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many
            unique browsers visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having
            to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered preference
            information before. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can
            usually set your browser to disable cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. The help
            function on most browsers contains instructions on how to set your browser to notify you before
            accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site
            will not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>
        <p>When you use the Site, you may set up your personal profile, create and publish your own
            Library, create and participate in groups (eventually), attend and publish courses, organize and
            participate in conferences (eventually), place and answer questions, send messages, perform
            searches and queries, transmit information through various channels, etc. We collect this
            information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features, for example,
            so as to enable you to manage your knowledge, to return to view prior messages you have sent,
            to easily see your contact list, etc. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy
            of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that
            information.</p>
        <p>When needed (e.g. in order to bill you for any services rendered) we may ask for your credit card
            information. However, we do not store credit card information.</p>
        <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you make your personal information available for viewing by
            third parties online - for example by putting it in your profile or contact information and allowing
            third parties to have access to it, by putting it on message boards, web logs, through email or in
            chat areas, etc. - that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. Similarly,
            other users of the Site can also see and may collect and use any content you have published on the
            Site, including courses, tests, questions, answers, offerings, etc. We cannot be responsible for any
            unauthorized third-party use of such information. Besides, although we allow you to set privacy
            options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or
            impenetrable. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that any content you post on the Site
            will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any
            privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge
            that, even after removal, copies of any content posted by you on the Site may remain viewable in
            cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored it. In this respect, please also
            keep in mind that, whenever possible, personally identifiable information is requested at the Site
            on an optional basis, which means that it is you who choose what information you put in your
            profile, including contact and personal information, pictures, knowledge, interests and groups you
            join.</p>
        <p>As mentioned above, the name under which you register with the Site is displayed and made
            available to the other registered users of the Site as part of your profile. All of your activities on
            the Site will be identifiable to your registered name. Accordingly, please keep in mind that if you
            register under your name, other registered users of the Site will be able to personally identify your
            activities on the Site.</p>
        <p>Any personal information collected by us will be processed in adherence to applicable United
            States and European Data Protection legislation. Reasonable and appropriate measures are taken
            to ensure that your personal information is protected from unauthorized access or modification,
            unlawful destruction and improper use. However, the Internet is an open system and we cannot
            and do not guarantee that the personal information you have submitted will not be intercepted by
            others and decrypted.</p>
        <p>Under no circumstances will we sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information
            or your contact information (even if not personally identifiable) to third parties for marketing
            purposes without your explicit prior consent. However, we may aggregate personal information
            in a manner that does not allow your identification as an individual and disclose such information
            to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes (e.g. for displaying
            targeted advertisements on the Site).  Further, except as otherwise described herein, we will only
            share your personal information with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide
            services, or as necessary to enforce our Terms of Use Agreement or protect the rights, property,
            or personal safety of Schoox, its users, and the public.  For example, we may use a third party
            service provider to perform services such as billing users for fee-based services.  In addition,
            we may transmit personal information to one or more third parties providing external hosting
            services to us.  These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personal information except
            to provide these services (including all third party hosting services, which generally will store
            this information as part of the service they provide to us), and they are bound by confidentiality
            agreements limiting the use of your information</p>
        <p>We will use your personal information for the purpose for which you have provided it, i.e. for
            providing you with the Site’s services that you request, as well as for offering you personalized
            features and contacting you to inform you of new products, promotions, features and helpful
            tips for our services. Furthermore, we may use your personal information if deemed necessary
            to comply with the law, respond to claims, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, protect our
            computer systems and customers, ensure the integrity and operation of our business and systems,
            protect the rights, property or safety of the Site, any Site users, or other third parties, enforce
            our Terms of Use agreement, bill any amounts due from you, measure consumer interest in our
            products and services, customize your experience, and as otherwise described to you at the time
            of collection, use or disclosure.</p>
        <p>You agree that we may also use your personal information to contact you and deliver information
            to you that are targeted to your interests, such as targeted advertisements, notices, offerings, and
            communications relevant to your use of the Site.</p>
        <p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on the Site constitutes a severe
            violation of the Site’s Terms of Use and should be reported to us at our contact information given
            above.</p>
        <p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Site or the services offered through it were to
            change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner, so the service can continue
            operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the
            terms contained in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h1>INFORMATION SECURITY.</h1>
        <p>We store all user information in secure databases protected via a variety of industry-standard
            access controls.  Secure passwords, SSL encryption and disk-based encryption (however, we do
            not use encryption during your day-to-day use of our website), firewalls, and other electronic
            measures are in place that help us protect your data.  We also maintain physical and procedural
            safeguards, such as secure areas in buildings, authentication procedures, training our employees
            in the proper handling of personal information, and limiting employee access to this information
            to those employees with a business need for access.  We employ these measures to ensure this
            data is accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement.  When we use third
            parties to assist us, we require that they comply with all the same confidentiality and security
            measures.  However, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure
            or warrant the security of any information you transmit to the Site.  There is no guarantee
            that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our
            physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.  It is your responsibility to protect the security
            of your login and account information.  Please note that emails, instant messaging, and similar
            means of communication are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any
            confidential information through these means.</p>
        <h1>Accessing, modifying, rectifying and removing of personally identifiable information</h1>
        <p>You retain the right to access, modify, rectify or remove any personally identifiable information
            in our possession at any time. However, where you make use of the communication features
            of the Site to share information with other users of the Site (e.g., public comments, posts,
            discussions, etc.) you generally cannot remove such communications once posted. Accordingly,
            please keep in mind that even after you remove information from your profile or delete your
            account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been
            shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied
            or stored by other users.</p>
        <p>Access and control over most personally identifiable information on the Site is available through
            the profile editing tools. Site users may modify, rectify or remove any of their profile information
            at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately. If you wish to
            deactivate your account or have us remove any personally identifiable information of yours from
            our databases, you may exercise these rights by contacting us at the contact information given
            above, on the condition that you can prove your identity.</p>
        <p><strong>California Privacy Rights</strong>.  California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users that are
            California residents to request that we not share their personally identifiable information
            with third parties if we know or have reason to know that the third parties use the personally
            identifiable information for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  For their protection, we
            exercise this right on behalf of our California users and require third parties hired by Schoox to
            keep all personally identifiable information related to California users secure and to not permit
            any use of personally identifiable information for direct marketing or any other purposes not
            authorized by Schoox.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns relating to this privacy policy, the security of the Site or
            any other relevant matter, please contact us at info@schoox.com or at the postal address given
            above for Schoox Inc.</p>
