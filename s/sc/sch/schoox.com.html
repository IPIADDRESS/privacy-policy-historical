        </p>

        <p><b>Children’s Privacy</b></p>

        <p>
            schoox.com complies both with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and, with regard to EU data
            subjects, with GDPR. While children under the age of eighteen (18) may use the Site only with the consent of
            his or her parent or legal guardian, please be advised that this Site is not directed or otherwise promoted for
            use by children under the age of sixteen (16). By using the Service, you represent that you are at least sixteen
            (16) years of age. If you are between sixteen (16) and eighteen (18) years of age, you will need to have
            parental consent to use the Service. If you are below sixteen years of age, you should stop using the Site and
            Service immediately. Personal data from children under 16 is not knowingly collected, nor are children
            under 16 knowingly contacted by schoox.com. To be clear, schoox.com does not intend to solicit information of any kind from children under 16. It is possible that schoox.com may receive emails pertaining
            to children under 16. If this is the case and schoox.com is notified of this, as soon as the information is

            offered and/or performed by schoox.com.
            <br><br>
            We will make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases, where appropriate, that consent is
            given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available
            technology.
        </p>

        <p><b>Compliance with Laws</b></p>
        <p>We will disclose your personal information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that

        requests of law enforcement or of protecting the security or integrity of our services.

        <p>
            We will keep your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we are
            processing it, unless the law permits or requires longer. For example, we might need to keep your personal
            data for quality assurance of the service we have provided, or we might need to keep it to defend future legal
            claims or to comply with a legal obligation.
