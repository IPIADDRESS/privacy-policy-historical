        care about children and understand that they have special privacy needs. 
        Therefore, we have adopted the following privacy policy regarding children: 
        We will NOT collect, use, or distribute to third parties personally identifiable 
        information without prior verifiable parental consent. We will NOT give 
        the child access to unmonitored chat rooms, message boards, email accounts, 
        or other services that would give the child the ability to publicly post 
        or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without prior 
        verifiable parental consent. When verifiable parental consent is not obtained, 
        we will only use the online contact information (such as email) to: </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000066" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Respond 
        directly to the child's request on a one-time basis and not use that information

        the name or online contact information of a parent for the purpose of 
        obtaining parental consent or providing parental notification.</font><br>

        more than once directly to a specific request from a child (such as in 
        the case where a child requests a newsletter subscription) and not used 
        to re-contact the child for other purposes. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000066" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
        will use our best efforts to provide parental notification, which will 
        include the nature and intended use as well as an opportunity for the 
        parent to prevent the use of the information and participation in the 
        activity. We will NOT entice the child to divulge more information than 
        is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service. We will provide 
        the parent a description of the specific types of a personally identifiable 
        information collected from their child upon request. We will allow the 
        parent to refuse further use or future online collection of personally 
        identifiable information and provide a way for a parent to obtain any 
        personally identifiable information collected from their child. We will 
        provide notice to children in age appropriate terms of what personally 
        identifiable information is to be collected. We will NOT provide any links
