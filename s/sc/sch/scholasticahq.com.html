                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>We respect the privacy of our Account holders, the privacy of our Account holder’s users' data, and the privacy of their client data. All user information contained within the forms you may use or build on the https://scholasticahq.com Site are governed by our <a href="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>. Scholastica, Inc. is based in the United States. Scholastica serves as the data controller for information users submit themselves (e.g. name, email, uploading manuscripts or reviews, etc.), and the data processor for information other users upload (e.g. an editor uploading a manuscript on behalf of an author, an editor entering a reviewer's email address to send a reviewer invitation, an editor importing data into Scholastica, etc.).</p>

              <div id="what_we_collect">
                <h2>What information we collect</h2>
                <p>We collect the email addresses and certain personally identifiable information (e.g. name, institutional affiliation, etc.) of those who communicate with us, e.g., when you create an account, request a free trial or demo, register for a webinar, contact us, subscribe to our email newsletter, download content (e.g. whitepapers), opt in to receive updates about new content resources, or register with us to open an “Account”. We also collect information volunteered by the users (such as any surveys Scholastica might conduct and/or site registrations).</p>
                <p>We collect information about how you use the site - for example, which pages users access or visit. We collect information about what kind of device you use to access the site (e.g. mobile vs desktop, browser type, etc.).</p>
                <p>When you register on the Site we ask for identifying information including your name, email address, institutional affiliation, department, specialties, personal image, publications, and other websites.</p>
                <p>In certain cases, you can optionally enter sensitive personal information, e.g. when submitting a manuscript, the journal may have optional fields asking for demographic information such as gender, race, and sexual orientation.</p>
                <p>Those who sign up for a journal account will enter additional information about the journal including journal contact email, editorial board, submission guidelines, and image.</p>
                <p>When you submit information, you are transferring such information into the United States and you hereby consent to such transfer.</p>
                <p>Scholastica may also collect and analyze from visitors and users certain information regarding the use of the Site and Services available therein.

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>Scholastica has implemented processes intended to protect user information and maintain security of data. Each Account holder requires a unique user name and password, which is required to access their Account. It is each user’s responsibility to protect the security of his or her login information. We encrypt some information and use secure third-party vendors for our servers and to host data in a secure way.</p>
                <p>These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of data, but NO GUARANTY CAN BE MADE THAT YOUR INFORMATION AND DATA WILL BE SECURE FROM INTRUSIONS AND UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE TO THIRD PARTIES.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="data-retention">
                <h2>Data retention</h2>
                <p>We only retain the personal data collected from Account holders and those who opt into email communication (e.g. by downloading a white paper, subscribing to the blog) for as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which it was initially collected, unless otherwise required by law.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="your-rights">
                <h2>Your rights</h2>
                <p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. You may contact us at support@scholasticahq.com to request assistance.</p>
                <p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or another user/journal customer are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Access and update your information: Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account. You can view and update your profile information from within your account settings. For other information (e.g. information outside the site, such as in our marketing database) please contact us at support@scholasticahq.com to request your information.</li>
                  <li>Delete your information: You can request we delete your information by emailing us at support@scholasticahq.com to request assistance. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.</li>
                  <li>Request that we stop using your information: In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe an account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us at support@scholasticahq.com to request assistance. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.</li>
                  <li>Opt out of communications: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within individual emails or by contacting us at support@scholasticahq.com to request assistance.</li>
                  <li>Data portability: Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for example, as a CSV or structured JSON file). Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of the information.</li>

              <div id="legal-basis-eea">
                <h2>Legal bases for processing (for EEA users)</h2>
                <p>If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>We need it to provide you site functionality, including to operate the Site, provide customer support, personalized features, and to protect the safety and security of the Site;</li>
                  <li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the site and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>
                  <li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li>
                  <li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                  <li>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Note that we may be using your information because we or a third party (e.g. a journal using Scholastica) have a legitimate business interest to do so. For example: if you write a review of a manuscript for a journal using Scholastica, the journal has a legal interest in retaining a record of who submitted the review. Similarly, if a journal decides to stop using Scholastica, the user who submitted the review has a legitimate interest in retaining a record of the review in Scholastica after the journal stops using the site.</li>

                <p>When you use the Site, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. You may update your Account information by logging into your Account. When requests come to Scholastica with regard to personal information, we ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.</p>
