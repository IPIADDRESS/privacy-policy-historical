								<em class="HeaderSM">At Scholarships.com, your privacy is important to us</em>
								<br>
								Scholarships.com maintains high standards for the protection of your privacy 
								over the Internet. Scholarships.com has created this privacy policy to 
								demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and to explain the types of 
								information we obtain about visitors to our website, how the information is 
								obtained, how it is used, and how visitors can restrict its use or disclosure. 
								The following discusses our information gathering and dissemination practices 
								at Scholarships.com.
								<br>
								<br>
								The only information Scholarships.com obtains about individual visitors to our 
								website is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor. Our website's 
								personal profile questionnaire requires users to volunteer contact information 
								(name and address for example), and demographic information (zip code, age, or 
								income level). We ask if we may make information about you available to our 
								select list of marketing partners (Opt-In/Opt-Out). Scholarships.com is very 
								careful in selecting its marketing partners. We work with reputable, leading 
								companies and organizations that provide products and services that are useful 
								and of interest to students and parents. Marketing partners may be providers of 
								services for direct marketing applications including lookup and reference, data 
								enhancement, suppression and validation. Marketing partners will never be 
								companies or organizations involved with pornography, tobacco or other 
								industries we find to be objectionable or potentially harmful. Though we are 
								selective with whom we partner, we do not control the practices of our 
								marketing partners.
								<br>
								<br>
								You may review or update any of your maintained personally identifiable 
								information by visiting <a href="Register.asp?destination=ProfileSummary.asp&amp;pagename=ProfileSummary">
									My Profile</a>.
								<br>
								At any time, you may also ask to review or update any of your maintained 
								personally identifiable information by contacting us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@scholarships.com">
									privacy@scholarships.com.</a> To protect the security and integrity of your 
								information, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before 
								providing access or correction.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Opt-In/Opt-Out</b><br>
								Scholarships.com is able to provide this free service, in part, based on the 
								willingness of our users to receive free information from our marketing 
								partners. When users opt-in, Scholarships.com may make the information they 
								supply available to leading companies who provide information on college 
								admissions and financing, or offers and promotions from organizations providing 
								products and services designed especially for students and parents.
								<br>
								<br>
								Scholarships.com understands the importance of personal information. We will 
								not share, sell, rent or otherwise transfer information without the user's 
								permission, and then only in accordance with the terms set forth in this 
								Privacy Policy. Our website provides users the opportunity to opt-out of having 
								their information used by our marketing partners. Users may opt-out, or change 
								their privacy preferences, by <a href="javascript:openWindow('PrivacyPreference.asp');">
									clicking here</a>.
								<br>
								<br>
								We may communicate with our users through email: to respond to visitor's email, 
								to send information that a user has requested, to inform users of new or 
								updated scholarship awards and financial aid opportunities, or additional 
								education financing information which may be of interest. In the event a user 
								contacts Scholarships.com via email, they will not be subject to receive any 
								communication other than a response to the email, unless specifically requested 
								by the user (ie; the user will not be defaulted into receiving any 
								secondary/promotional material).
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Cookies</b><br>
								A cookie is a very small text file placed on your hard disk by a web server. It 
								cannot be executed as code, deliver viruses and can only be read by the server 
								that created it. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable 
								information. The cookie's purpose is to tell our web server that a visitor has 
								initiated a user session. At Scholarships.com cookies are used to time-out a 
								user session; users who may have forgotten to complete their scholarship 
								search.
								<br>
								<br>
								To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we do collect some non-individually 
								identifiable generic information about our visitors. Our web servers 
								automatically recognize a visitor's IP address, the web page from which a 
								visitor enters our website, which pages a visitor visits, and how much time a 
								visitor spends on each page. This information does not reveal a visitor's 
								identity. We aggregate this information and use it to help diagnose problems 
								with our server, to administer our website, or to evaluate and improve our 
								website.
								<br>
								<br>
								Scholarships.com contains text and banner links to other websites that may use 
								cookies. Most Internet browsers are set up to allow the creation of cookies; 
								however, you can specify that you be prompted before a site puts a cookie on 
								your hard disk, so you can choose to allow or disallow the cookie; or you can 
								prevent your browser from accepting any cookies (click on your browsers 
								Tools…Internet Options…Security…Custom Level…etc.). Scholarships.com is not 
								responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
								<br>
								<br>
								We may share information about our website's visitors with our marketing 
								partners. This information is only provided in the aggregate, meaning that the 
								information is about our website's visitors as a whole and not individually 
								identifiable visitors.
								<br>
								<br>
								Scholarships.com is committed to safeguarding users' privacy on our website. We 
								require our employees to protect the privacy of information about our users and 
								visitors and expect our marketing partners to do so as well. You can feel 
								confident that your individually identifiable information will be protected 
								when you visit Scholarships.com. We have security measures in place to protect 
								against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Collection of Information from Children</b><br>
								In April 2000, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) became a 
								law that regulates the business practices of gathering personal data online 
								from children under the age of 13. Scholarships.com abides by COPPA, and works 
								diligently to ensure compliance with the law. As such, Scholarships.com will 
								not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from, or allow 
								the registration of, children under the age of 13.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
								If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner 
								different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via 
								email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in 
								this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our 
								privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our 
								database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of 
								the change. In some cases where we post the notice, we will also email users, 
								who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes 
								in our privacy practices.
								<br>
								<br>
								Scholarships.com has adopted privacy principals that state our commitment and 
								define our policy on safeguarding visitor and user privacy when we conduct our 
								business. Questions regarding this privacy policy statement, the practices of 
								this website, or your dealings with Scholarships.com should be directed to 
								Scholarships.com at <a href="mailto:privacy@scholarships.com">privacy@scholarships.com.</a>.
