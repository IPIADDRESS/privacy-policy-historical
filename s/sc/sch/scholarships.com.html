                            Scholarships.com maintains high
                            standards for the protection of your privacy over the Internet. Scholarships.com
                            has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy
                            and to explain the types of information we obtain about visitors to our website,
                            how the information is obtained, how it is used, and how visitors can restrict its
                            use or disclosure. The following discusses our information gathering and dissemination
                            practices at Scholarships.com.

                            The only personal information Scholarships.com obtains about individual visitors
                            to our website is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor. Our website's
                            personal profile questionnaire requires users to volunteer contact information (name
                            and address for example), and demographic information (zip code, age, or income
                            level). We ask if we may make information about you available to our select list
                            of marketing partners (Opt In/Opt Out). Scholarships.com is very careful in selecting
                            its marketing partners. We work with reputable, leading companies and organizations
                            that provide products and services that are useful and of interest to students and
                            parents. When Scholarships.com shares your personal information with a third party
                            under any circumstance described in this Privacy Policy, your personal information
                            will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of
                            the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy
                            with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information. If you
                            initially decide to receive communications from our marketing partners, you may
                            need to contact and deal with them directly if you later decide that you do not
                            want to receive their communications or if you would like to change any information
                            you provided online. In this particular situation, any changes you would like to
                            make to your personal information must be given directly to the company who is communicating
                            with you at that point in time. We reserve the right to disclose your personally-identifiable
                            information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary
                            to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order,
                            or legal process served on our website.

                            It is the responsibility of the user to make all necessary changes in their profile
                            to ensure the information they have provided while completing their registration
                            or conducting a scholarship search remains current.

                            password they submitted when creating their profile. Once you have logged in, you
                            will be taken to the "Membersâ€™ Area". On that page is a text link to "My Profile".
                            Click on that link and you will be taken to a summary of your information, divided
                            into sections. You will see an "Edit This Section" option in the upper-right corner
                            of each section. Just click the "Edit This Section" link and you will be able to
                            modify and update your information. To protect the security and integrity of your
                            information, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before providing
                            access.

                        <p>
                            To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we do collect some non-individually-identifiable
                            generic information about our visitors. Our web servers automatically recognize
                            a visitor's IP address, the web page from which a visitor enters our website, which
                            pages a visitor visits, and how much time a visitor spends on each page. This information
                            does not reveal a visitor's identity. We aggregate this information and use it to
                            help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, or to evaluate
                            and improve our website. We use cookies to tell our server that a visitor has initiated
                            a user session; however, they do not contain any personally identifiable information.
                            Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have
                            no access to, nor control over, these cookies. This privacy statement covers the

                            The security of your personal information is important to us. If you prefer to do
                            so, you may use our "Secure Socket Layer" or "SSL" by clicking the padlock icon
                            on our home page prior to entering your information. You can learn more about SSL

                        <p>
                            We follow generally-accepted industry standards to protect the personal information
                            submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method
                            of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
                            Therefore, while we strive to use commercially-acceptable means to protect your
                            personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

                            Collection of Information from Children</h4>
                        <p>
                            In April 2000, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) became a law
                            that regulates the gathering of personal data online from children under the age
                            of 13. Scholarships.com abides by COPPA, and works diligently to ensure compliance
                            with the law. As such, Scholarships.com will not knowingly collect any personally-identifiable
                            information from, or allow the registration of, children under the age of 13.

                            Notification of Changes</h4>
                        <p>
                            If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner materially
                            different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email.
                            You will have a choice as to whether we may use your information in this materially
                            different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices
                            that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post
                            a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases
                            where we post the notice, we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications
                            from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
