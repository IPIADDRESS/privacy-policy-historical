                                Scholarships.com maintains high standards for the protection of your privacy over
                                the Internet. Scholarships.com has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our
                                firm commitment to your privacy and to explain the types of information we obtain
                                about visitors to our website, how the information is obtained, how it is used,
                                and how visitors can restrict its use or disclosure. The following discusses our
                                information gathering and dissemination practices at Scholarships.com.
                            </p>
                            <div class="dividernil">

                            <p>
                                The only personal information Scholarships.com obtains about individual visitors
                                to our website is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor. Our website's
                                personal profile questionnaire requires users to volunteer contact information (name
                                and address for example) and demographic information (zip code, age, or income level).
                                We ask if we may make information about you available to our select list of marketing
                                partners (opt-in/opt-out). Scholarships.com is very careful in selecting its marketing
                                partners. We work with reputable, leading companies and organizations that provide
                                products and services that are useful and of interest to students and parents. When
                                Scholarships.com shares your personal information with a third party under any circumstance
                                described in this Privacy Policy, your personal information will become permanently
                                subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the
                                third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use
                                and further sharing of your personal information. If you agree to receive communications
                                from our marketing partners and later change your mind, you may have to deal with
                                those companies directly. Any updates you wish to make to the information they possess
                                must also be given directly to the company communicating with you at that point
                                in time. We reserve the right to disclose your personally-identifiable information
                                as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our
                                rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process
                                served on our website.

                                and entering the email address and password they submitted when creating their profile.

                                In the tabbed navigation at the top of the page is a link to "Profile". Click on
                                that tab and you will be taken to a summary of your information, divided into sections.
                                You will see an "Edit This Section" option in the upper-right corner of each section.
                                Just click the "Edit This Section" link, and you will be able to modify and update
                                your information. To protect the security and integrity of your information, we
                                will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before providing access.

                                a visitor's IP address, the web page from which a visitor enters our website, which
                                pages a visitor visits, and how much time a visitor spends on each page. This information
                                does not reveal a visitor's identity. We aggregate this information and use it to

                                In April 2000, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) became a law
                                that regulates the gathering of personal data online from children under the age
                                of 13. Scholarships.com abides by COPPA, and works diligently to ensure compliance
                                with the law. As such, Scholarships.com will not knowingly collect any personally-identifiable
                                information from, or allow the registration of, children under the age of 13.

                                that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post
                                a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases
                                where we post the notice, we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications
                                from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
