    <p>
        Scholarships.com recognizes that your privacy is important. To demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and to explain the types of information we obtain about visitors 
        to our website, how that information is obtained and used, and how visitors can restrict its use or disclosure, we have created the Privacy Policy below. 
        The following discusses our information gathering and dissemination practices at Scholarships.com.
    </p>
    <div class="dividernil">
    </div>
    <h2>
        Information We Receive and How It Is Used</h2>
    <p>
        All personal information obtained by Scholarships.com about individual visitors
        to our website is information supplied voluntarily by that visitor. During registration, users are required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, address,
        email address, phone number, a password, date of birth, gender, and country of citizenship.
        In addition, users may choose to provide other categories of information, such
        as career objectives, health or disability information, hobbies, and other interests.
        Scholarships.com encourages users to provide all fields of information to maximize the effectiveness of the scholarship and college search.
We ask for permission when sharing information with marketing partners, which are reputable companies and organizations that provide products
        and services of interest to students and parents. Users may choose whether to opt-in or opt-out of sharing information with our marketing partners.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Scholarships.com shares personal information with a third party, the 
information will become permanently subject
        to the information use and sharing practices of the third party. The third  party
        will not be restricted by our Privacy Policy, with respect to its use and further
        sharing of your personal information. If you agree to receive communications from
        our marketing partners and later change your mind, you will need to contact those
        companies directly. Any information updates you wish to make must be forwarded to the company at that point in time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users may change personal profile information at Scholarships.com
        at any time by logging in to the website and entering the email address and password associated with their profile. After users have logged in, they will
        be directed to their Scholarship Matches. In the tabbed navigation at the top
        of the page, users will find a link to "Profile". By clicking on that tab, users
        will be directed to a summary of their information, divided into sections. An "Edit
        This Section" option in the upper-right corner of each section allows users to modify
        and update their information. Users can also <a href="/about-us/contact-us/privacy-policy/">
            contact us here</a> in order to request access to submitted information.
        To protect the security and integrity of our users’ information, we will take necessary steps in verifying all new profile identities before providing access. It is the responsibility
        of the user to make all necessary changes in their profile and make sure their profiles are up-to-date. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Users of Scholarships.com who wish to terminate their membership, or otherwise request to cease usage of their information at Scholarships.com
        may do so at any time by contacting us via our contact form by <a href="/about-us/contact-us/account-updates-and-questions/" title="Website Content" target="_top">clicking here</a>. Please be sure to type "Remove" in
        the subject field and submit the email account associated with the membership you would like terminated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Information will be retained for as long as the account is active or requests our services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to
        comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
    <p>
        Scholarships.com is committed to safeguarding users' privacy on our website. We
        require our employees to protect our users and visitors by keeping their profile
        information private, and expect our marketing partners to follow suit. Rest assured that your user profile will be protected when you visit Scholarships.com. There are security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration
        of all user information under our control.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regardless of whether or not you wish to share your personal information,
        we reserve the right to share aggregated demographic data and related information
        with our business partners. Such aggregate information will not contain any personal
        information that can identify any individual user.</p>
    <h2 id="optinoptout">
        Information Sharing &amp; Email Preferences</h2>
    <p>
        Scholarships.com understands the importance of protecting personally-identifiable
        information. We will not share, sell, rent or otherwise transfer any information
        without the user's permission, and then, only in accordance with the terms set forth
        in this Privacy Policy. Our website provides users the opportunity to unsubscribe/opt-out from receiving email messages from Scholarships.com and its marketing
        partners, or from having their personal information shared with our marketing partners.
        Users may change their email preferences by following the unsubscribe instructions
        contained in each of the email messages they receive or by <a href="/about-us/privacy-policy/unsubscribe/" title="Unsubscribe" target="_top">clicking here</a>. Please allow up to seven business
        days for these changes to take effect. If you no longer wish to be a registered user of Scholarships.com, you may have your profile removed by <a href="/about-us/contact-us/email-unsubscribe-or-remove-profile/" title="Email Unsubscribe" target="_top">clicking here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scholarships.com may periodically use contact information in order to send emails regarding updates at the Scholarships.com site, such as scholarship 
        opportunities and additional listings. The frequency
        of these messages will vary depending on the user's preference, including the types of
        scholarships and other activities in which a user has indicated an interest. If you specifically
        provide Scholarships.com with permission at the time of registration, you may also
        receive commercial emails. Please note that email messages from third parties are
        not governed by the opt-out provisions of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
<p>
We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process. When we believe that disclosure is necessary to 
    protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request
</p>
<p>
We may provide your personal information to company provider services that help us with business-related activity; such as shipping your order or offering customer service. 
    These companies are authorized to use your personal information only on a service-needs basis.
</p>
    <h2>
        Collection of Passive Information</h2>
        <p>
        To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we collect generic information about our visitors that is not individually-identifiable. Our, and our third party tracking-utility 
            partners, and web servers automatically recognize a visitor's IP address, the web page from which a visitor enters our website- which pages a visitor visits, 
            and how much time a visitor spends on each page. This information does not reveal a visitor's identity. We aggregate this information and use it to help diagnose 
            problems with our web server, to manage our website and traffic thereof, and to evaluate and improve our website’s functions and resources. We do not link this data to 
            personally identifiable information. We use cookies, tags and scripts to tell our server that a visitor has initiated a user session; however, they do not contain 
            individually-identifiable information. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but 
            your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited. Some of our business partners, such as advertisers, use cookies on our site, but we have 
            neither access to, nor control over, these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Scholarships.com only and does not cover the use of cookies 
            by our business partners.
    </p>
    <p>We partner with a third party ad network to display advertising on our web site. Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable 
        information about your activities on this and other web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used 
        for targeting ads, you may opt-out by <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served 
        advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
    </p>
    <p>We use Google AdSense to publish ads on this site. When you view or click on an ad a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on 
        this and other web sites. You may opt-out of the use of this cookie by visiting Google’s Advertising and Privacy page: 
        <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may share statistical and demographic information about our website's visitors
        with our marketing partners. This information is only provided in the aggregate;
        meaning that the information is about our website's visitors as a group and not
        about individually-identifiable visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
        We follow general industry standards to protect the submitted personal information, both during transmission and after it is received. However, no method
        of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100 percent
        secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially-acceptable means to protect
        your personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact our <a href="/about-us/contact-us/privacy-policy/" title="Privacy Policy" target="_top">privacy department</a>.</p>
    <h2>
        Public Forums</h2>

    <p>
        Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These
        Features may collect your IP address, page visitation on the site, and
        may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features
        are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions
        with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing
        them.</p>

        Links to Other Websites</h2>
    <p>
        Scholarships.com contains text and banner links to other sites. Scholarships.com does not exercise control over the information, products,

    </p>
    <h2>
        Collection of Information from Children</h2>
    <p>
        Scholarships.com abides by federal law and the guidelines set up by the Federal
        Trade Commission regarding youth privacy. As such, Scholarships.com will not knowingly
        collect any personally-identifiable information from children under the age of 13,
        nor will children under the age of 13 be allowed to register with Scholarships.com.

    <h2>
        Notification of Changes</h2>
    <p>
        If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email prior to the 
        effective change.
        You may decide whether or not we can use your information in this manner.
        In addition, if we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy that do not affect
        user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice
        on our website notifying users of the change. In cases where we post notice of changes,
        we may also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying
        them of the changes to our privacy practices.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event that Scholarships.com sells, signs or transfers some or all of its
        business to a successor or acquirer, Scholarships.com may sell, assign or transfer
        all of your information, regardless of your opt status, to such successor or acquirer.</p>
