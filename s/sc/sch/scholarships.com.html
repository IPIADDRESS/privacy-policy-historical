    <h2>
        Information We Receive and How It Is Used</h2>
    <p>
        All personal information obtained by Scholarships.com about individual visitors
        to our website is information supplied voluntarily by that visitor. During registration, users are required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, address,
        email address, phone number, a password, date of birth, gender, and country of citizenship.
        In addition, users may choose to provide other categories of information, such
        as career objectives, health or disability information, hobbies, and other interests.
        Scholarships.com encourages users to provide all fields of information to maximize the effectiveness of the scholarship and college search.
We ask for permission when sharing information with marketing partners- which are reputable companies and organizations that provide products
        and services of interest to students and parents. Users may choose whether to opt-in
        or opt-out of sharing information with partners.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Scholarships.com shares personal information with a third party, the 
information will become permanently subject
        to the information use and sharing practices of the third party. The third  party
        will not be restricted by our Privacy Policy, with respect to its use and further
        sharing of your personal information. If you agree to receive communications from
        our marketing partners and later change your mind, you will need to contact those
        companies directly. Any information updates you wish to make must be forwarded to the company at that point in time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users may change personal profile information at Scholarships.com
        at any time by logging in to the website and entering the email address and password submitted when creating their profile. After users have logged in, they will
        be directed to their Scholarship Search Results. In the tabbed navigation at the top
        of the page, users will find a link to "Profile". By clicking on that tab, users
        will be directed to a summary of their information- divided into sections. An "Edit
        This Section" option in the upper-right corner of each section allows users to modify
        and update their information. Users can also <a href="/about-us/contact-us/privacy-policy/">
            contact us here</a> in order to request access submitted information.
        To protect the security and integrity of users’ information, we will take necessary steps in verifying all new profile identities before providing access. It is the responsibility
        of the user to make all necessary changes in their profile and make sure all changes in their profiles are up-to-date.

        comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

        Scholarships.com is committed to safeguarding users' privacy on our website. We
        require our employees to protect our users and visitors by keeping their profile

        of all user information under our control.

        Regardless of whether or not you wish to share your personal information,
        we reserve the right to share aggregated demographic data and related information
        with our business partners. Such aggregate information will not contain any personal
        information that can identify any individual user.</p>

        Information Sharing &amp; Email Preferences</h2>
    <p>
        Scholarships.com understands the importance of protecting personally-identifiable

    <p>
        Scholarships.com may periodically use contact information in order to send emails regarding updates at the Scholarships.com site, such as Scholarships.com

        not governed by the opt-out provisions of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
<p>
We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process. When we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request
</p>
<p>
We may provide your personal information to company provider services that help us with business-related activity; such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only on a service-needs basis.

    <h2>
        Collection of Passive Information</h2>
        <p>
        To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we collect generic information about our visitors that is not individually-identifiable. Our, and our third party tracking-utility partners, and web servers automatically recognize a visitor's IP address, the web page from which a visitor enters our website- which pages a visitor visits, and how much time a visitor spends on each page. This information does not reveal a visitor's identity. We aggregate this information and use it to help diagnose problems with our web server, to administer to our website, or to evaluate and improve our website’s functions and resources. We do not link this data to personally identifiable information. We use cookies, tags and scripts to tell our server that a visitor has initiated a user session; however, they do not contain individually-identifiable information. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited. Some of our business partners, such as advertisers, use cookies on our site, but we have neither access to, nor control over, these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Scholarships.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by our business partners.
