          <h4>Framing:</h4>
          <p>On some of our sites we have special offers with our partners where another third party is actually framed within our site. However, you are actually on a third party Web site and should be aware that you are entering information on a third party site.

          <h4>Links to Other Sites:</h4><p>If you click on a link to a third party site, [including on an advertisement], you will leave our site and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as scholarshipzone.com. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services.</p>      
          <h4>Web Beacons:</h4><p>Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
<h4>Widgets:</h4>
		  <p>
          Our Web site includes Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g. displaying loan information, the news, etc). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly.

          <h4>Security:</h4><p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
          <h4>SMS Messaging:</h4><p>
          If applicable, this website, scholarshipzone.com, websites linking to scholarshipzone.com, and websites linked from this website (collectively "We") may make available a service either directly or through third parties by which you can receive messages on your wireless device via short message service ("SMS Service"). Your provider's standard data and messaging rates apply to all SMS correspondence. All charges are billed by and payable to your mobile service provider. You represent that you are 18 years of age and the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. Data obtained from you in connection with this SMS Service may include your name, address, cell phone number, your provider's name, and the date, time, and content of your messages. The use of this information will be in accordance with this Mobile Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies. You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS basis. We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. You may opt out of the SMS Service at any time by replying "STOP", "END", or "QUIT" to the SMS text message you have received. This process impacts only the future delivery of the particular SMS message offering, so you must send that message for each offering.</p>
