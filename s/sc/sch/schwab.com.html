How We Share Information About You Within the Schwab Family of Companies<br>
</b><br>
Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc. is part of the Schwab family of financial services companies that are owned by our parent, The Charles Schwab Corporation. These companies are often referred to as "affiliates" and include, but are not limited to: <br>
<br>
The Charles Schwab Corporation <br>
Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., a broker-dealer <br>
U.S. Trust Corporation, a wealth management firm <br>
Charles Schwab Bank, N.A., a retail bank <br>
CyberTrader, Inc., a broker-dealer for active traders <br>
<br>
Many clients within the Schwab family of companies do business with more than one affiliate, creating an efficient, comprehensive financial relationship to meet individual needs. When appropriate, Schwab may share information we collect about you within our family of companies to: <ul style="list-style-type:bulleted">
<li>help provide you with better service or perform services on our behalf; </li>
<li>respond to communications from you or as you authorize or request; </li>
<li>make it more convenient for you to open a new account; </li>
<li>allow an affiliate to provide you with information about its products and services that we believe may benefit or interest you. </li>
</ul>You may instruct us <b>not</b> to share information about you with our affiliates for certain purposes, as explained under "How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You." <br>
<br>
<b>How We Share Information About You Outside of the Schwab Family of Companies</b><br>
We provide access to information about you to outside companies and other third parties in certain limited circumstances, including: <ul style="list-style-type:bulleted">
<li>to help us process transactions for your account; </li>
<li>when we use another company to provide services for us, such as printing and mailing your account statements; </li>
<li>when we believe that disclosure is required or permitted under law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulatory or law enforcement authorities, to resolve consumer disputes, to perform credit/authentication checks, or for risk control; </li>
<li>when we enter into a joint marketing agreement with another financial institution in order to provide you with a Charles Schwab &amp; Co.-branded (or other Schwab affiliate-branded) financial product or service. We only make such agreements with companies that we believe can help us provide a financial product or service that will benefit you. </li>
</ul>You may instruct us <b>not</b> to share information about you with outside companies for joint marketing purposes, as explained under "How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You." <br>
<br>
<b>How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You </b><br>
If you prefer, you may choose to limit the information we share about you with our affiliates and outside companies. Specifically, you may instruct us: <br>
<ul style="list-style-type:bulleted">
<li><b>not</b> to share with our affiliates consumer reports and other personal information about you that may be used to determine your eligibility for credit (for example, information about your income, profession or employment status); </li>
<li><b>not</b> to allow our affiliates to market their financial products or services to you based on information they receive from us about your eligibility for credit or your transactions and experiences with us; </li>
<li><b>not</b> to share personal information about you with an outside company for joint marketing purposes. </li>
<li>You may exercise this choice by calling us at <br>
<b>877-812-1817</b>; or<br>
for services in Chinese at <b>800-662-6068</b>; <br>
for services in Spanish at <b>800-786-5174</b>; <br>
from outside the U.S. at&nbsp; <b>415-667-5009</b>; </li>
<li>Your choice will be applied to you as an individual and will automatically be extended to all of your accounts with us, as well as to any accounts you may have with any of our affiliates, except for accounts you may have at U.S. Trust Corporation. If you have an account at U.S. Trust Corporation, you will receive a separate privacy notice&nbsp;which will tell you how it&nbsp;shares information about you and how you can limit its&nbsp;ability to do so. </li>
<li>Joint account holders may instruct us on behalf of another account holder. </li>
<li>You may make your privacy choice at any time and it will remain in effect until you change it. </li>
</ul><br>
If you choose to limit these types of information sharing, we may continue to share information with our affiliates that identifies you (such as your name and Social Security number), as well as information about your transactions and experiences with us. In addition, our affiliates may continue to use information they receive from us to perform services on our behalf, to respond to communications from you, as you authorize or request, or, if you are their customer, to offer you products or services. We may also continue to share information about you with outside companies as permitted or required by law. <br>
<br>
<b>State Laws </b><br>
We will comply with state laws that apply to the disclosure or use of information about you. For example, if your address is in Vermont, we will automatically limit information sharing as described in "How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You" without your having to advise us of this privacy choice.<br>

<b>Safeguarding Your Information, Maintaining Your Trust</b><br>
We take precautions to ensure the information we collect about you is protected and is accessed only by authorized individuals or organizations. <br>
<br>
Companies we use to provide support services are not allowed to use information about our clients for their own purposes and are contractually obligated to maintain strict confidentiality. We limit their use of information to the performance of the specific services we have requested. <br>
<br>
We restrict access to personal information by our employees and agents. Our employees are trained about privacy and are required to safeguard personal information. <br>

Schwab understands that you have entrusted us with personal information that is both important and confidential. We take our responsibility to protect your information extremely seriously. <br>
<br>
Schwab updates its security and privacy standards to guard against identity theft and provide security for your account information. We constantly re-evaluate our security and privacy policies and adapt them as necessary to deal with new challenges. <br>
<br>
Schwab’s account protection efforts fall into but are not limited to these categories:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type:ordered">

</ol><br>
More information on our&nbsp;security measures&nbsp;can be found below. <br>
<br>
<div class="bodyHeadline"><a name="authentication"></a>Authentication</div><br>
Authentication is the process that our clients go through to access secure areas of our Website. This process takes place when you log into your account. The two key components of login are your Login ID and Password. <br>
<br>
Login ID: We urge you to create your own unique Login ID and recommend that it be a Login ID that you don’t commonly use for other purposes. We particularly urge you not to use your Social Security or number date of birth as a Login ID. Please call Schwab at&nbsp;<b>800-435-4000 </b>and a representative will assist you in creating a new Login ID. <br>
<br>
Passwords: We maintain strict rules to help prevent others from guessing your password, and recommend that you change your password periodically. Your password must meet the following criteria:<ul style="list-style-type:bulleted">
<li>6-8 characters long </li>
<li>Include both letters and numbers </li>
<li>Include at least one number between the first and last character </li>
</ul>In addition, for your protection, repeated unsuccessful attempts to log in will cause&nbsp;your online access&nbsp;to be disabled. Once this happens your password must be reset. If this happens to you inadvertently, please follow the instructions under “Forgot your password” on the Login page <br>
<br>
<a href="#returntotop">Return to top</a><br>
<br>
<div class="bodyHeadline"><a name="Web_Site"></a>Web Site Security</div><br>
From the time you submit your Login ID and Password, communications between your computer and Schwab are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL3) technology, a secure communication protocol that protects your privacy. SSL enables client and server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery. <br>
<br>
To support this technology, you need a recent version of an SSL3-capable, 128-bit browser, such as Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer, or AOL. These browsers will activate SSL3 automatically whenever you sign on to your Schwab account. <br>
<br>
Look for the padlock! To ensure that SSL encryption is protecting your private communications, look for a small picture of a padlock on the browser frame. Another indicator is the URL prefix “HTTPS”. See below.<br>

If you move the cursor over the “locked padlock” icon, a pop-up message will appear stating “SSL Secured (128 Bit).” Absence of the pop-up message may indicate that you are connected to a “phishing site."<br>
<br>
Another important information security measure in place throughout Schwab’s Web sites is the timeout feature. This feature will log you out of your account if there has been no activity within a specified amount of time. It is designed to stop others from accessing your account if you fail to log out.<br>
<br>
We have implemented these measures for your protection, but you should still remember to log out each time you have finished accessing your Schwab accounts.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="branch_kiosks"></a>Branch Kiosks:</b><br>
Schwab maintains particularly strong information security controls at the computer kiosks in its nationwide branch network to protect your account data. These measures include:<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:bulleted">
<li>A highly controlled environment with limits on the Web sites clients are allowed to visit, the applications they are allowed to open, the Internet technologies they are allowed to use, and the operating system controls they are permitted to access. </li>
<li>Additional and more aggressive timeout policies that go beyond the timeout policies on our Web site. These will log you out of your account automatically if you walk away from the kiosk without logging out. The quick timeouts are based on keyboard activity and infrared sensors that detect when you have physically moved away from the kiosk. We have implemented these measures for your protection, but you should still remember to log out each time you have finished accessing your Schwab accounts </li>
</ul><b>Cookies: </b><br>
Cookies enable us to understand better how you and others use Schwab's online channels. They allow us to collect information about where your browser goes on our Web sites. This assists us in understanding your preferences and improving our Web site. For example, the information we obtain from cookies or GIFs (Graphical Interchange Format) helps us understand whether our customers use certain Web features and how to improve navigation. We also may use information gathered as the result of GIFs or cookies to target emails or Web messages. Knowing where your browser has been on our website helps us present useful information and offers to you. We do not sell this or any other information about you to other websites, merchants or financial institutions. Unless you have affirmatively consented, we do not provide any personally identifiable information about you to anyone else for their marketing purposes.<br>
<br>
Cookies come in two flavors: persistent and session-based. <br>
<ul style="list-style-type:bulleted">
<li>Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include a unique identifier for your browser that only Schwab can read and use, and that tells us you are a Schwab customer or prior Schwab Web site visitor. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information we send through persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. </li>
<li>Session cookies exist only during an online session with Schwab. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Session cookies allow you to conduct transactions or request your own personal or account information on our Web site. They contain encrypted or encoded information about your account(s), and/or identifying information that you have previously provided to us. This information allows Schwab to process your online transactions and requests </li>

<h1><a name="email"></a>Email Security</h1><br>
Recently there has been rapid growth in email-related information security challenges such as “phishing” or “spoofing” schemes. These fraudulent techniques attempt to fool you into giving up your personal data by impersonating legitimate communications from financial service providers. We are working with other financial institutions and technology leaders to prevent these security challenges from impacting our clients. Measures currently in place or underway include:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:bulleted">
<li>Implementation of domain-verification technologies that, in cooperation with Internet service providers, will enable clients to verify that emails claiming to have come from Schwab actually did come from Schwab.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Standardization of Schwab emails and adherence to industry anti-phishing best practices. We continually re-design our email policies to incorporate the latest tools and standards aimed at preventing phishing. </li>
<li>Ongoing assessment and implementation of new login technologies designed to prevent others from masquerading as our Web site. </li>

Employees are trained in our notifications policy and are required to promptly report any potential breach to our swift response team. All customers are covered by Schwab’s Breach Notification Policy. In July 2003, Schwab implemented a corporate policy on breach notifications and a centralized swift response team was established. Privacy, Risk Management &amp; Investigations, Information Security, Legal, Corporate Communications and other of our business units work together to respond to potential incidents as quickly as possible. <ul style="list-style-type:bulleted">

<b>Client Security Practices <br>
</b>Your participation is an important component of all of our security efforts. We believe it is essential that we work in close cooperation with you as our client to maintain the highest levels of security. These are the steps you should take to protect your account:<br>
<br>
<b>Protecting the security of your computer </b><br>
<ul style="list-style-type:bulleted">
<li>Keep your computer and browser software current with security updates. </li>
<li>Install and update anti-virus and anti-spyware software and use personal firewalls to protect your computer. </li>
<li>Be alert to the threats posed by malware--short for malicious software, this form of software is designed specifically to damage or disrupt a system, or to secretly record information such as keystrokes. Malware types include key logging tools, trojan horses, hijacking programs, and dialer programs that may reside on your personal computer. While these threats constantly evolve, you can help protect your personal information and computer by using a personal firewall, maintaining up-to-date anti-spyware and anti-virus programs, and by immediately reporting any suspicious activity involving your personal information. </li>
<li>Do not enable any application features that would automatically log you in to your Schwab account or pre-fill the Login ID or Password fields. </li>
<li>Change your password periodically and avoid using passwords for Schwab that you commonly use for other purposes. </li>

<li>Check to make sure you are interacting with a secure Web site <a href="#Web_Site">see above</a>. </li>
<li>Always log off after accessing your Schwab account. This prevents someone else from accessing your account if you leave your computer unattended while the session has not yet “timed out,” or automatically shut down. </li>
<li>Be careful about using <a href="#branch_kiosks">third-party computers</a> or computers that you are not familiar with, such as those in Internet cafés. </li>
</ul>If you do use a third-party computer, be particularly careful to ensure you have fully logged out.

<h1><a name="againstphishing"></a>How to Protect Against Phishing </h1><br>
<b>What Is Phishing? <br>
</b>Phishing is the illegal attempt to mislead consumers into providing personal or financial information, including account numbers, passwords and Social Security numbers, via email or through fraudulent Web sites. <br>
<br>
The most frequent phishing attacks occur through email disguised to appear as though it came from a reputable financial institution or company. <br>
<br>
Most phishing attempts urge you to update or validate your account information, typically through a link in an email directing you to a fake Web site that appears to be legitimate. <br>
<br>
<b>How To Spot a Phishing Attack </b><br>
There are many phishing attacks active on the Internet. Here are a few of their lines and lures: <br>
<ul style="list-style-type:bulleted">
<li>An email contains an “urgent” or “shocking” tone requesting your immediate action on an account-related matter. Phishers frequently succeed by getting consumers to act quickly without thinking. </li>
<li>An email is sent from a user falsely claiming to be a legitimate company with an attachment. An unsolicited email attachment more than likely contains a virus. Do not open it. </li>
<li>A pop-up window appears from a user falsely claiming to be a legitimate company’s Web site asking for personal information. </li>
