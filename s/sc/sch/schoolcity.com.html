                    your family. We believe that education is not limited to the 
                    classroom, but is the ongoing responsibility of every citizen, 
                    both online and offline. Part of becoming a good Internet 
                    citizen, or "Netizen," is becoming educated about online privacy 
                    and safety issues. To this end, we have provided the following

                    our collection and use of your personal information. We hope

                    &nbsp;<br>
                    Lesson 1: Understanding the Use of your IP Address Every computer 
                    online, including yours, has an IP address. In fact, it is 
                    not possible to use the Internet without one. An IP address 
                    is a unique number used by computers to identify one another. 
                    It consists of four groups of numbers separated by decimal 
                    points and may look something like this: 195.58.64.1. IP addresses 
                    may be "dynamic" or "fixed," and depending on the type of 
                    IP address you have, it may or may not be possible to identify 
                    your individual computer. If an IP address is dynamic, it 
                    is automatically assigned to your computer from a pool of 
                    available numbers when you log on to the Internet or your 
                    local network. This means that your computer's IP address 
                    will be different each time you use the Internet, and can 
                    only be used to identify the network (e.g. your company) or 
                    Internet Service Provider (e.g. AOL or CompuServe) that owns 
                    the pool of addresses from which your address came. If an 
                    IP address is fixed, you or a network administrator would 
                    have had to manually enter an IP address into your computer 
                    on when it was first set up to access the Internet. In this 
                    case your IP address remains the same each time you log on 
                    to the Internet or your local network and may be used to identify 
                    your individual computer. SchoolCity.com does collect your 
                    IP address when you visit our site. We use this information 
                    to administer our website and help diagnose problems with 
                    our server. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic 
                    information (e.g. how many users are connecting from commercial 
                    (.com) locations versus government (.gov) locations). We do 
                    not attempt to link your IP address information to any of 
                    your personally identifiable information. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Lesson 2: Protecting your Personal Information You usually 
                    don't give out your full name, address, telephone number and 
                    personal e-mail address to every stranger you meet on the 
                    street. Yet, you may do just that online. On the other hand, 
                    you would certainly want to give contact information to an 
                    interesting new acquaintance, colleague or business contact. 
                    Part of using the Internet wisely and safely is knowing who 
                    is collecting your information, what information they are 
                    collecting and how they are using it. Our site's registration 
                    form requires you to provide us with contact information (such 
                    as your name and email address) and demographic information 
                    (such as your zip code, and age). We then use the information 
                    from this registration form to send you further information 
                    about SchoolCity.com or to contact you when necessary. If 
                    you wish, you may choose not to receive these mailings from 
                    us. (For more information, see </p>
                  <p>Lesson 3: Choosing your Cookies Cookies in the offline world 
                    are tasty treats, but you wouldn't necessarily want to accept 
                    one from someone you didn't know. Online cookies are similar 
                    in some ways. On the Internet, cookies are pieces of information 
                    that a web site transfers to your computer's hard drive. These 
                    cookies then send information about your on-line activities 
                    back to a web site. Cookies are used by most major web sites 
                    and can be viewed as a great help in web surfing or as an 
                    invasion of privacy. Most browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer 
                    or Netscape) are initially set up to accept cookies. By changing 
                    your browser's preferences, you can have it refuse all cookies, 
                    accept some cookies and refuse others, or ask for your approval 
                    before accepting a cookie. While refusing all cookies will 
                    help to protect your privacy, most major web sites either 
                    will not function properly or will be considerably slower 
                    if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you may 
                    not be able to set personalized news preferences or complete 
                    online shopping transactions. At SchoolCity.com, we use cookies 
                    to deliver content specific to your interests. Cookies also 
                    help us to determine how you use our site and to make improvements 
                    to our site. These cookies do not contain or track any personal 
                    information regarding the user. We use an outside advertising 
                    company to display ads on our site. These ads may also contain 
                    cookies. The cookies you receive through these banner ads 
                    are collected by an advertising company, and SchoolCity.com 
                    does not have access to or control over this information. 
                    The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers 
                    is standard in the Internet industry.</p>
                  <p> Lesson 4: Visiting Other Web Sites When you travel to a 
                    different country, state, province or territory, you probably 
                    expect to encounter slightly different laws and customs. You 
                    would also not expect the laws that apply in your home to 
                    apply to the place in which you are traveling, and you would 
                    not expect your local legislators to have power in other regions. 
                    Likewise, all web sites operate under different rules and 
                    conventions. Our web site contains links, or virtual roads, 
                    by which you can travel to other web sites. For example, if 
                    you click on a banner ad at the top of one of our web pages, 
                    you may be taken to another web site. Although, we have an 
                    educational advisory board, which reviews all the advertisements 
                    that are displayed on our web site, we do not control these 
                    web sites, and are not responsible for their privacy practices 
                    or content. Also, all the links to other web sites provided 
                    as resources for teachers, parents and students are reviewed 
                    by a group of teachers and parents for content. </p>
                  <p>Lesson 5: Using Public Forums In the offline world, you'd 
                    be wary of posting your address, phone number and other personal 
                    information on a public bulletin board. Likewise, we urge 
                    you to exercise caution when disclosing personal information 
                    in chat rooms, forums, message boards and new groups provided 
                    by SchoolCity for your use. Any information that is disclosed 
                    in these areas is public information and can be accessed by 
                    any Internet user. </p>
                  <p>Lesson 6: Guidelines for Children Children are an essential 
                    part of the SchoolCity.com community, and we are committed 
                    to ensuring their safety and privacy online as much as we 
                    possibly can. However, as in any community parents, teachers 
                    and guardians must be active partners in the effort to make 
                    sure that children are kept safe and their privacy is respected. 
                    Children under the age of 13 can only be registered by their 
                    school. We do not collect personally identifiable online or 
                    offline contact information directly from children under the 
                    age of 13. This information is provided by authorized school 
                    personnel only. We do not distribute to third parties any 
                    online or offline information related to children under the 
                    age of 13. Additionally, we will never send a copy of mass 
                    emailing to children under the age of 13 and will never list 
                    them in any member directory in a manner in which their age 
                    can be easily identified.</p>
                  <p> Lesson 7: Controlling your Personal Information Finally, 
                    we at SchoolCity.com allow you to update or remove any personal 
                    information you have provided, as well as the opportunity 
                    to opt out of receiving communications from our partners and 
                    us. To change your password, or edit your contact or other 
                    personal information, click on the My Profile link within
