<h3>Privacy Notice</h3>

<p>
	Schools Financial Credit Union is a member-owned financial cooperative 
	dedicated to serving the financial needs of our members. You joined the Credit 
	Union with the expectation that we act in the best interest of our membership 
	and make available the financial products and services that enable you to meet 
	your financial goals. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with you, 
	and the preservation of that trust is of the highest importance to us. It is 
	with that purpose in mind that we have formulated the following privacy policy:
</p>
<p>
	Both Schools Financial Credit Union (“Credit Union”) 
	and Schools Financial Services Corporation (“SFSC”) want you to 
	understand what information we collect, how we use it, and with whom we share 
	it. We will inform you annually about our privacy policy. This joint policy 
	applies to both current and former Schools members and addresses the disclosure 
	of personal information about you that may not be available in public records. 
	We use the terms “affiliate” and "nonaffiliate” to describe 
	companies with which we may share your information. An “affiliate company” 
	is one which either the Credit Union or SFSC owns or over which we have control. 
	As SFSC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Credit Union, both the Credit Union 
	and SFSC are affiliates of each other. A “nonaffiliate” is a third 
	party with which we have a business or marketing relationship and performs services 
	on our or your behalf.
</p>
<p><strong>What Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>
	We collect personal information directly from you in the course 
	of providing you our products and services. We collect your personal information 
	from you, your applications, our transactions, consumer reporting agencies, 
	and the verification of your information. The type of information we collect 
	is about your identity (name, address, date of birth, driver’s license 
	number, Social Security Number); your transaction history with us, our affiliates, 
	or others (account balances, payment history, credit card usage); and your assets, 
	income, and credit worthiness.
</p>
<p>
	We collect your personal information in order to provide you 
	with products and services you request; to know who you are and prevent unauthorized 
	access to your information; to offer products and services that are of value 
	to you; and to comply with the regulations that govern us.
</p>
<p><strong>What Information We Disclose</strong></p>
<p>
	We will not sell, share, give, or otherwise provide your personal 
	information to any nonaffiliated third party for the marketing of their products 
	and services. We may share your personal information as described above with 
	our affiliate organization. In addition, we may offer to our members the products 
	and services of a nonaffiliated third party, but the Credit Union and/or SFSC 
	will market those products and services directly to you, and we will not provide 
	the nonaffiliated third party with information about you. We choose third parties 
	carefully and enter into contractual agreements with them to ensure that the 
	information you gave directly to them is used only to provide you the service 
	you requested. In accordance with our contractual agreements, third parties 
	may not market their products or service directly to you.
</p>
<p>
	We are permitted by law to share with nonaffiliated third parties 
	the information necessary to administer the products and services we provide, 
	to follow your instruction, to meet our business needs, or to comply with state 
	and federal law. You cannot opt out of the disclosure of this information. Examples 
	of these third parties are credit bureaus, check printers, mail houses, marketing 
	service providers, courts, and state and federal government agencies. Please 
	be assured that we will only share information with nonaffiliated third parties 
	to the extent required or permitted by law. Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting 
	Act (“FCRA”), it is our practice to share Transaction/Experience 
	information (as defined by the FCRA) with our affiliates and nonaffiliated third 
	parties to the extent permitted by law and by our policies.
</p>
<p><strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong></p>
<p>
	We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural controls that 
	comply with federal regulations to guard your information. We restrict access 
	to your personal information to those employees who need it in order to provide 
	products and services to you. Where appropriate, we use security-encoding techniques 
	to protect against unauthorized access to personal records, ensure accuracy 
	and integrity of data, and protect your confidentiality. We provide training 
	to educate employees on the purpose and implementation of procedures related 
	to privacy and the confidentiality of member data.
</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Our Policy</strong></p>
<p>
	We reserve the right to revise our policy as our business needs 
	change or as the law requires. If we revise our policies, we will provide our 
	members with copies of our new policies at that time. Restricting Credit Offers, 
	Direct Mail, and Tele-marketing Solicitations Businesses can obtain information 
	about you from public records, such as those available at County Recorders. 
	They may use this information to market their services and sometimes make reference 
	to your Credit Union. Schools cannot control or restrict the use of publicly 
	available information about you, and we do no authorize these businesses to 
	use our name. However, there are steps you can take to minimize these and other 
	types of direct mail solicitations.
