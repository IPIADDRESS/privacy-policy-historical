												What SchoolTube's Guidelines 
												Cover
												</font></b>
					</p><p>
												<font face="Tahoma" size="2">
												• How SchoolTube handles 
												personal information* it 
												receives, both on and off the 
												Internet; <br>
												• What information SchoolTube 
												collects and how it collects it;
												<br>
												• What you can do to control the 
												information about you that 
												SchoolTube collected, including 
												certain changes you can make to 
												that information; and <br>
												• How SchoolTube protects 
												information it collects from 
												misuse. <br>
												* Personal information is 
												information that identifies a 
												person, such as their name, 
												address, or email address, that 
												is not otherwise publicly 
												available.

												<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2">
												General Guidelines For 
												Information Collection and Use
												</font></b>
					</p><p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">• SchoolTube collects and 
					compiles statistical information about all visitors to our 
					web site, even if they haven't registered. The information 
					used to compile statistics is passed from a visitor's 
					computer to our server each time a page is requested. This 
					statistical information is logged and provides long-term 
					usage data and trends that help SchoolTube allocate 
					resources and better meet demands during peak usage. This 
					information is not linked to the end user and is not 
					considered personal information. The information collected 
					includes: </font>
					</p><blockquote>
						<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">1. the type and version 
						of your Operating System and Web Browser; <br>
						2. your computer's IP address; <br>
						3. the date and time of your visit; <br>
						4. what page you visited; and <br>
						5. what page you came from. </font>
					</p></blockquote>
					<p>
												<font face="Tahoma" size="2">
												• When you register with 
												SchoolTube, you are no longer 
												anonymous. Your registration 
												information is used to deliver 
												SchoolTube education and 
												outreach program material and to 
												help SchoolTube develop future 
												program material. Certain 
												statistical information gathered 
												from our subscribers is used to 
												generate reports for 
												governmental agencies. We must 
												report this information because 
												SchoolTube receives Grant money 
												from the U.S. government. 
												SchoolTube does not identify you 
												by name in these reports; it 
												only reports information in the 
												aggregate. <br>
												• SchoolTube often collects 
												information from people who 
												attend SchoolTube activities or 
												events or who our staff members 
												meet during the course of their 
												duties. If we believe these 
												people may be interested in the 
												SchoolTube program material, we 
												elect to subscribe them. If so, 
												we notify them via e-mail and 
												ask whether or not they want 
												this material.</font></p><p>
												<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2">
												Children
												</font></b>
					</p><p>
												<font face="Tahoma" size="2">
												• SchoolTube will not ask a 
												child or young person under the 
												age of 13 for more information 
												than is reasonable in order to 
												provide that student with the 
												appropriate Internet Safety 
												information on Youth Empowerment 
												which SchoolTube offers.<br>
												Information Sharing and 
												Disclosure <br>
												• Other than the following 
												instances, SchoolTube does not 
												rent, sell or share personal 
												information about you with any 
												other person(s) or 
												organization(s):
												</font>
					</p><blockquote>
						<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">o SchoolTube may share 
						your information with outsourced service providers in 
						order to provide the materials you requested. For 
						example, to fill an order for training materials, your 
						name, address, and phone number may be provided to a 
						third-party order filling agency so they can ship you 
						the materials. <br>
						o When the law requires SchoolTube to respond to 
						subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, 
						SchoolTube provides the information needed to obey the 
						law. SchoolTube also may provide information in order to 
						establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against 
						legal claims. <br>
						o SchoolTube believes it is necessary to share 
						information in order to investigate, prevent, or take 
						action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, 
						situations involving potential threats to the physical 
						safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or 
						as otherwise required by law.</font></p></blockquote>
					<p>
												<font face="Tahoma" size="2">
												• SchoolTube makes every 
												reasonable effort to ensure the 
												security of the data it 
												collects. However, SchoolTube 
												cannot warrant against the 
												disclosure of this information 
												in the event of a security 
												breach or other event beyond our 
												control.</font></p><p>

												Your Ability to Edit Your

												• New program information may be
