      <h5>SMS Messaging:</h5>
      This website, scholarships4moms.net, websites linking to scholarships4moms.net, and websites linked
from this website (collectively "We") may make available a service
either directly or through third parties by which you can receive
messages on your wireless device via short message service ("SMS
Service"). Your provider's standard data and messaging rates apply to
all SMS correspondence. All charges are billed by and payable to your
mobile service provider. You represent that you are 18 years of age
and the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which
messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the
applicable charges. Data obtained from you in connection with this SMS
Service may include your name, address, cell phone number, your
provider's name, and the date, time, and content of your messages. The
use of this information will be in accordance with this Mobile Policy.
If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide
your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith.
Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect
data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are
governed by their own policies. You acknowledge and agree that the SMS
Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other
means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We will not
be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as
delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network
operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS basis. We do
not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or
secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or
security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking
precautions and providing security measures best suited for your
situation and intended use of the SMS Service. You may opt out of the
SMS Service at any time by replying "STOP", "END", or "QUIT" to the
SMS text message you have received. This process impacts only the
future delivery of the
particular SMS message offering, so you must send that message for
each offering.
