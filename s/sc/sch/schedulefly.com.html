<h2><font color="#28a315">
At Schedulefly, we believe privacy is important.
The disclosure of personal information will not occur without your explicit consent. Should we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page to 
keep you informed of what information we collect and how we use it.
</font></h2>
	
<p>																											

<b>Information We Collect and How We Use It</b><br>
To become a paying Schedulefly customer you must provide billing information such as your 
name, company name, billing address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit card information. This information is necessary for us to create your account, to send you payment receipts, and 
occasionally notify you about changes to our website, new services, or special 
offers you may find useful.<br><br>

<b>Will you share my personal information with anyone?</b>
<br>																														
No. Protecting your personal information is very important to us. ScheduleFly will not 																														
sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to others. Ever.
	<br><br>		
																											
<b>How do you protect my Information?</b><br>
Our website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and 
alteration of the information under our control. We use secure servers (secured by Comodo) 
when charging your credit card or viewing/updating your personal 
information. The secure server layer (SSL) encrypts all information sent to our 
merchant services provider as well the information being transmitted from our 
server to a browser. All customer data is similarly protected against 
unauthorized access. We train all of our employees about the importance of privacy. We give access to information about customers only to those employees who require it to perform their jobs. 
<br><br>
<b>Does Schedulefly use cookies?</b><br>
Yes. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, only a unique session id that allows us to recognize that you have logged in successfully. The cookie is a memory only cookie - which means it's gone when you logout or close your internet browser. We do not place any files on your computer.
<br><br>

<b>Will your privacy policy ever change?</b>
<br>
As Schedulefly evolves, this privacy policy is likely to evolve with it. 
We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent. 
When changes do occur, we will post them on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes). 
<br>
																														<br>
																														<b>Your Feedback</b>

																														policy. <br>Please <a href="contact.aspx">send us your comments</a> or write to us at 809 Blenheim Dr Raleigh NC 27612.
