			<li>Our affiliates for support of our internal and business operations, their own marketing purposes, or pursuant to your direct request or opt-in;</li>

			<li>In connection with a Business Transfer, as defined below.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			When we disclose your personally identifiable information to these third parties, your personally identifiable information will 
			become subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this 
			Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personally identifiable information.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, we may disclose your non-personally identifiable information with our affiliates, our other EducationPlus Network businesses, 
			and non-affiliated third parties, such as advertisers, content distributors, and service providers.
		</p>
		<a name="aggregation" id="aggregation" class="ArticleBy">Aggregation and De-Personalization</a>
		<p>
			We may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, 
			either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with 
			information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the 
			information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). We may use and/or disclose 
			to third parties such aggregate or de-personalized information in any manner and without notice or compensation to you.
		</p>
		<a name="comparisons" id="comparisons" class="ArticleBy">Requests for Loan Comparisons</a>
		<p>
			The content of the Site is intended for educational purposes only.  The content is not intended to, 
			and does not, constitute legal or financial advice.  This Site will allow you to request a comparison 
			of the loan products from one or more third parties (<span class="bold-it-up">"Requested Providers"</span>).  If you provide your personally 
			identifiable information on the Site and request a loan comparison from Requested Providers (a <span class="bold-it-up">"Request"</span>), we 
			may disclose or sell your personally identifiable information to our affiliates, Requested Providers that we match 
			with your Request, or to other third parties that may match you with a Requested Provider.  In addition, the Requested 
			Providers and such third party may further disclose, share and use any personally identifiable information provided by 
			you in connection with your Request
		</p>
		<p class="bold-it-up">
			If you make a Request, you expressly consent to such disclosure and use of your personally identifiable information. 
			If you do not want your personally identifiable information shared as described above, then you should not submit a Request. 
		</p>
		<p>
			IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA TELEPHONE, FAX, 
			AND EMAIL. YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST ON THIS SITE, EVEN IF YOU 
			ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are matched with Requested Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested Providers conducting any research 
			necessary to provide you with a response to your Request. Requested Providers may need to share your personally identifiable 
			information to conduct such research. As an example, if you request a loan comparison, Requested Providers may order consumer 
			reports about you in connection with your application.  Such reports may provide information that may assist in determining 
			eligibility for loans and the rates you may be charged.  If you do not want Requested Providers to conduct necessary research 
			to provide you with a response for your Request, then you should not submit a Request.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that if you submit a Request on this Site and we share your information as described above in connection with your Request, 
			you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of your information in connection with that Request.
		</p>
		<a name="application" id="application" class="ArticleBy">Scholarship Applications</a>
		<p>
			If you are submitting information to us pursuant to or to apply for a scholarship offer, 
			please refer to the official rules for the applicable scholarship offer for additional terms that apply to 
			your information and the sharing, disclosure and treatment of your information for that particular purpose. 
		</p>
		<a name="forced_disclosure" id="forced_disclosure" class="ArticleBy">Forced Disclosures/Breach</a>
		<p>
			Although we use reasonable security measures to protect your information collected through this Site, 
			we cannot absolutely guarantee that this information will only be disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy.  
			For example, we may be forced to disclose personally identifiable information to the government or third parties under 
			certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, 
			notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy Policy, the Terms or any other applicable agreement or policy, you 
			use this Site at your own risk and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable 
			information will always remain private. In the unlikely event that an unauthorized third party compromises our security measures, 
			we will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized third party's ability to view, use or 
			disseminate such information.
		</p>
		<a name="business" id="business" class="ArticleBy">Business Transfers</a>
		<p>
			We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease, sell, assign or transfer your personally identifiable 
			information collected through this Site, and any of its databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained 
			in such data bases, to third parties in connection with a Business Transfer.  A <span class="bold-it-up">"Business Transfer"</span> means a sale, acquisition, merger, 
			consolidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is 
			only being contemplated and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our business.  Nothing in this 
			Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business, equity, and/or assets (including this Site) 
			to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation, without notice, any without any compensation 
			to you, whatsoever.
		</p>
		<a name="network" id="network" class="ArticleBy">Network Advertising</a>
		<p>
			From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising networks, such as third party advertising servers, advertising agencies, 
			technology vendors and research firms. We may use these third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising and promotional 
			purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements
			to make inferences about a consumer's interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted 
			to the consumer's specific interests. This practice is often referred to as <span class="bold-it-up">"online behavioral advertising."</span> For example, a third-party 
			advertising network might identify the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name 
			of a website you visit, whether you visit specific pages of this Site and other websites, the location of your Internet service provider, 
			the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and websites. Please see the "Online Behavioral Advertising" 
			subsection of Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information below to read about how you can prevent certain third-party 
			advertising networks from collecting information about you. 
		</p>
		<a name="generated_content" id="generated_content" class="ArticleBy">User-Generated Content</a>
		<p>
			You are responsible for any content, including personal information, that you contribute to be published or displayed ("posted") 
			on this Site, or that you transmit to other users of this Site (collectively, <span class="bold-it-up">"User-Generated Content"</span> or <span class="bold-it-up">"User Contributions"</span>). 
			Your User-Generated Content is posted on and transmitted to other users of this Site at your own risk. We cannot control the actions 
			of other users of this Site with whom you may choose to share your User-Generated Content. We can also not responsible for circumvention 
			of any privacy settings or security measures contained on this Site. As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User-Generated 
			Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your User-Generated 
			Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Site users. Proper access and use of 
			information provided on this Site, including User-Generated Content, is governed by our Terms of Use.
