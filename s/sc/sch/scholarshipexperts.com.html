</ul>
<h2 id="generated_content" class="ArticleBy">User Contributions</h2>
<p>This Website may contain public areas, forums, or features that allow you to provide your User Contributions to be published or displayed or transmitted to other users of this Website. Your User Contributions are posted on this Website and transmitted to others at your own risk. For this reason, we recommend that you do not include any sensitive or personally identifiable information about yourself or others in your User Contributions for these areas of this Website. Please see our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> for more information concerning User Contributions.</p>
<h2 id="automatic" class="ArticleBy">Automatic Information Collection Technologies and Website Usage Information</h2>
<p>We and our service providers automatically collect “Website Usage Information” from or about you, such as information about your computer or mobile device, IP address, web browser, computer or device platform, related software and settings you are using, browsing actions and patterns, the referring page that linked you to us and the website you visit after this Website, and other usage activity on this Website. Collection of Website Usage Information helps us to improve this Website and to deliver a better and more personalized service by enabling us to, among other things: (1) estimate our audience size and usage patterns; (2) store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize this Website according to your individual interests; (3) speed up your searches; and (4) recognize you when you return to this Website.</p>
<p>The automatic collection technologies we and our service providers may use for this automatic information collection include:</p>
<ul class="terms-list">
<li><span class="bold-it-up">Cookies (or browser cookies).</span> A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser or related software and stored on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a website. Generally, cookies can track what you look at and where you travel on websites and what transactions you make. They can also store Personal Information about you, including your username and password. A “session cookie” expires immediately when you end your browsing session with the particular website. A “persistent cookie” stores information on your hard drive so when you end your browsing session and return to the same website later, the cookie information is still available. This Website may use both types of cookies.</li>
<li><span class="bold-it-up">Flash Cookies.</span> Certain features of this Website may use locally stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on this Website.</li>
<li><span class="bold-it-up">Web Beacons.</span> Pages of this Website and any e-mails we send to you may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened our e-mails and for other related website analytics (e.g., recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about managing your privacy settings regarding automatic collection of Website Usage Information, see the <a href="#choices">Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="network" class="ArticleBy">Third Party Advertisers and Interest-Based Ads</h2>
<p>With the exception of certain of our webpages, services or features that may collect sensitive Personal Information such as financial information, we may permit third party advertising companies or ad networks to display third party advertisements on our websites and/or automatically collect Website Usage Information from our websites for purposes of determining your preferences and delivering interest-based advertising and content to you, whether for our products or services or other companies’ products or services.</p>
<p>These third party advertisers may combine the Website Usage Information with Personal Information you directly submit to them or that they receive from other sources, or the Website Usage Information they collect may include information that could allow someone to specifically contact you online without necessarily knowing your identity. We do not have access to or control over the automatic collection technologies that these third party advertisers may use, and the information practices of these third party advertisers are subject to these parties’ respective privacy policies, not this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>You may want to receive interest-based ads for several reasons. Interest-based ads are helpful because they are more likely to be tailored to your particular interests. They are also more likely to help you discover new products and services that are actually relevant to you and your interests. Also if interest-based tracking is enabled, you likely will not see the same ads over and over because the number of times you see a particular interest-based ad is usually limited. By opting-out of interest-based ads, you lose all of these benefits. If you would like more information about opting-out of interest-based ads or would like to opt-out, see the <a href="#choices" target="_blank">Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information</a> section or visit the opt-out pages of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> (“NAI”) and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> (“DAA”). We follow the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>

<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Information you provide to us. Below are some mechanisms that provide you with control over your information:</p>
<ul class="terms-list">
<li><span class="bold-it-up">Promotional E-mails.</span> If you do not wish to receive promotional e-mails from us, including our e-newsletters, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@unigogroup.com">privacy@unigogroup.com</a> to opt-out or follow the unsubscribe process at the bottom of the promotional e-mail.
