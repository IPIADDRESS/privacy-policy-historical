<h2 class="ArticleBy" id="aggregation">Aggregation and De-Personalization</h2>
<p>We may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information).

<h2 class="ArticleBy" id="comparisons">Requests for Loan Comparisons</h2>
<p>The content of the Site is intended for educational purposes only. The content is not intended to, and does not, constitute legal or financial advice. This Site will allow you to request a comparison of the loan products from one or more third parties (<span class="bold-it-up">“Requested Providers”</span>). If you provide your personally identifiable information on the Site and request a loan comparison from Requested Providers (a <span class="bold-it-up">“Request”</span>), we may disclose or sell your personally identifiable information to our affiliates, Requested Providers that we match with your Request, or to other third parties that may match you with a Requested Provider. In addition, the Requested Providers and such third party may further disclose, share and use any personally identifiable information provided by you in connection with your Request

<p>If you are matched with Requested Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with a response to your Request. Requested Providers may need to share your personally identifiable information to conduct such research. As an example, if you request a loan comparison, Requested Providers may order consumer reports about you in connection with your application. Such reports may provide information that may assist in determining eligibility for loans and the rates you may be charged. If you do not want Requested Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a response for your Request, then you should not submit a Request.</p>
<p>Please note that if you submit a Request on this Site and we share your information as described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of your information in connection with that Request.</p>
<h2 class="ArticleBy" id="application">Scholarship Applications</h2>

<h2 class="ArticleBy" id="forced_disclosure">Forced Disclosures/Breach</h2>
<p>Although we use reasonable security measures to protect your information collected through this Site, we cannot absolutely guarantee that this information will only be disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose personally identifiable information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy Policy, the Terms or any other applicable agreement or policy, you use this Site at your own risk and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information will always remain private. In the unlikely event that an unauthorized third party compromises our security measures, we will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized third party’s ability to view, use or disseminate such information.</p>
<h2 class="ArticleBy" id="business">Business Transfers</h2>
<p>We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease, sell, assign or transfer your personally identifiable information collected through this Site, and any of its databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained in such data bases, to third parties in connection with a Business Transfer. A <span class="bold-it-up">“Business Transfer”</span> means a sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our business. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business, equity, and/or assets (including this Site) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation, without notice, any without any compensation to you, whatsoever.</p>
<h2 class="ArticleBy" id="network">Network Advertising</h2>
<p>From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising networks, such as third party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms. We may use these third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s specific interests. This practice is often referred to as <span class="bold-it-up">“online behavioral advertising.”</span> For example, a third-party advertising network might identify the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether you visit specific pages of this Site and other websites, the location of your Internet service provider, the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and websites. Please see the “Online Behavioral Advertising” subsection of Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information below to read about how you can prevent certain third-party advertising networks from collecting information about you.</p>
<h2 class="ArticleBy" id="generated_content">User-Generated Content</h2>
<p>You are responsible for any content, including personal information, that you contribute to be published or displayed (“posted”) on this Site, or that you transmit to other users of this Site (collectively, <span class="bold-it-up">“User-Generated Content”</span> or <span class="bold-it-up">“User Contributions”</span>). Your User-Generated Content is posted on and transmitted to other users of this Site at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of this Site with whom you may choose to share your User-Generated Content. We can also not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on this Site. As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User-Generated Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your User-Generated Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Site users. Proper access and use of information provided on this Site, including User-Generated Content, is governed by our Terms of Use.</p>
<h2 class="ArticleBy" id="choices">Your Choices About Use and Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. Below are some mechanisms that provide you with control over your information:</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italize">Cookies</span>. If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you may set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of this Site may then be inaccessible or may not function properly.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italize">Email Offers from Us</span>. If you do not wish to receive email offers or newsletters from us, you can opt-out of receiving email information from us (other than emails related to the completion of your registration, correction of user data, change of password and other similar communications essential to your transactions on this Site) by using the unsubscribe process at the bottom of the email.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italize">Accessing and Correcting Personal Information</span>. If this Site allows you to create an account with us, then you can review and update your personal information and certain information sharing preferences by logging into this Site, visiting your account profile page and making changes.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italize">Online Behavioral Advertising</span>. Certain third-party advertising networks that deliver behavioral advertising are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (<span class="bold-it-up">“NAI”</span>). You can prevent NAI member companies from collecting preference data about you by clicking <a class="italize" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a> and following the NAI’s directions. Note that if you opt out through the NAI, you will still receive advertising. In addition, if you opt out through the NAI and later delete your cookies, use a different browser or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italize">Information You Disclose to Third Parties</span>. You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from third parties in connection with this Site.
