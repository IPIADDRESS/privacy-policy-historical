		<p>ScholarshipExperts.com, a division of WiseChoice Brands, LLC
			(“us” or “we”), is committed to respecting the

		<p>We created this Website Privacy Notice (the “Privacy
			Notice”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Site,
			and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and
			the protection of privacy. This Privacy Notice is only applicable to
			the Site, and not any other websites that you may be able to access
			from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use
			practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.
		</p>
		<p>PLEASE NOTE: OUR ONLINE INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES
			MAY DIFFER FROM OUR PRACTICES REGARDING INFORMATION OBTAINED OFFLINE

		<a name="information" id="information" class="ArticleBy">Information Collection and Use</a>
		<p>This notice uses the term “nonpublic personal
			information.” This means personal information about you which
			identifies you, and that is not available from public sources, such as
			your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, age, gender,
			date of birth, and information about your interests in and use of
			various products, programs, and services. It may also include
			information related to your eligibility for various scholarships, such

			personal information about you from various sources, including:

				<li>Information provided by you such as, for example, information
					submitted during the registration process, the E-Profile form or via
					other online forms or when making a purchase from us;</li>
				<li>information about your transactions with us, our affiliates
					or others; and</li>
				<li>information we receive from third parties, such as, a list
					vendor, an address update service or other public or private data
					sources.</li>
				<li>Thus, information we obtain through the Site may be
					intermingled with and used in conjunction with information about you
					obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline
					and online sources.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>You can view or change the information you provide at any time
			by updating your profile.</p>
		<p>We may use the information we collect from you for any of the
			following purposes: (1) to deliver scholarship search results to you;
			(2) to fulfill your requests for products and services; (3) to contact
			you in connection with one of our surveys, sweepstakes or contests;
			(4) to provide you with targeted offers and advertising on the Site;

			offers from our company as well as from our subsidiaries, affiliates,
			marketing partners, advertisers and other third parties; (6) to
			contact you when necessary; (7) to review Site usage and operations;

		<a name="info_sharing" id="info_sharing" class="ArticleBy">Information
			Sharing</a>
		<p>We may disclose the information collected from and about you as
			follows: (1) to fulfill your requests for products and services,
			including your requests for information about scholarship sources; (2)
			to our affiliates or third party companies after you have given us
			permission to do so, for their own marketing purposes; (3) to our
			service providers, to perform a business, professional or technical
			support function for us; (4) if we believe that there has been a
			violation of our Site Terms of Use or of our rights or the rights of
			any third party; (5) to respond to judicial process and provide
			information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an
			investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by
			law, or otherwise as required by law; (6) in the event that our
			company or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your
			information may be one of the transferred assets; and (7) otherwise as
			required or permitted by law. In addition, if you have given us
			permission to do so through the OPT-IN section of your profile, we may

		<a name="cookies" id="cookies" class="ArticleBy">Cookies</a>
		<p>To enhance your online experience with us, many of our web pages
			use “cookies.” Cookies are text files placed on your hard
			disk by our web server to store your preferences. Cookies help us
			learn which areas of the Site are useful and which areas need
			improvement. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail
			address or other personally identifiable information and we do not
			store personally identifiable information in cookies.</p>
		<p>We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to
			understand how our Site is used, and to improve the content and
			offerings on the Site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize
			your experience at the Site or recall your specific information on
			subsequent visits (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to
			the Site). We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs or
			services. You can opt to have your browser reject cookies. If you do
			that, you may need to re-register with us every time you visit our
			Site in order to participate in certain promotions. You should also
			know that companies that advertise on the Site (and their agents)
			might use their own cookies. This policy does not cover how these
			companies use their cookies. We do not have access to or control over
			information collected by outside advertisers on our site.</p>
		<p>We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable
			information (i.e., generic information that does not identify you
			personally) when you visit any of the pages on the Site, such as the
			type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer), the type of
			operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), IP
			addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet), the
			domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online or
			EarthLink), the URL from which you access the Site and the URL you
			first visit after leaving the Site. In addition, we, or third-party
			service providers acting on our behalf, may use JavaScript to collect
			information about your browsing behavior on the Site, such as the
			areas or pages that you visit and the amount of time you spend viewing
			the Site.</p>
		<a name="non_pii" id="non_pii" class="ArticleBy"> How We Use
			Non-personally Identifiable Information</a>
		<p>As explained above, we use cookies as a convenience feature to
			save you time, to understand how our Site is used, to improve the
			content and offerings on the Site and to offer you products, programs,
			or services. If you are referred to the Site from one of our marketing
			partners, we may combine the non-personally identifiable information
			we collect from you with your personal information however; we will
			use the combined information only to compensate the marketing partner
			for your referral, and we will not disclose it. In addition, we
			sometimes use non-personally identifiable information to enable us to
			personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information
			in the aggregate to analyze how our Site is used, as well as to offer
			you products, programs or services. Sometimes we share aggregate,
			non-personally identifiable information with others, including
			affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies.</p>
		<a name="log_files" id="log_files" class="ArticleBy"> Log Files</a>
		<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site,
			track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for
			aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable
			information.</p>
		<a name="sharing" id="sharing" class="ArticleBy"> Sharing</a>
		<p>We may share aggregated demographic information with our
			partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal
			information that can identify any individual person.</p>
		<p>We may also share the information that you voluntarily entered,
			if you give us permission to do so through the OPT-IN section of your
			profile.</p>
		<a name="links" id="links" class="ArticleBy"> Third Party Websites</a>
		<p>This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other
			websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which
			may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ
			materially from this Policy. If you choose to visit other websites, we

			policies at those websites to confirm that you understand and agree
			with their policies.</p>

			Note to Parents and Children under 13</a>
		<p>We are a general audience website, and do not target any of our
			content specifically at children under 13 years of age. Nor do we
			knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of
			age. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under
			age 13, we will promptly delete any personal information in that
			user's account.</p>
		<a name="security" id="security" class="ArticleBy"> Security</a>
		<p>Access to nonpublic personal information about you is limited to
