	<p><strong>How We Respond to Browser "Do Not Track" Signals:</strong> Some Web browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Each browser communicates "Do Not Track" signals to the actual website differently making it unworkable to honor each and every request correctly. To alleviate any communication error between browsers and website, we do not respond to Web browser "Do Not Track" signals at this time. As the technology and communication between browser and website improves, we will reevaluate the ability to honor "Do Not Track" signals and may make changes to our policy.</p>
	<p><strong>Third Party Tracking:</strong> We permit third parties that we have agreements with to track you when you are on our website. When you leave our website there is a chance that these third parties may continue to track you.</p>
	<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Edvisors uses “cookies” and other technologies to help us learn more about how our users use our sites and to recognize you when you return. Cookies are text files that are placed in your computer’s browser by a Web page server, and that can be used to help recognize you as an Edvisors user. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies may store user preferences and other information, and can be deleted or blocked by changing the settings on your Web browser. You may also be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. However, choosing to decline cookies may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on Edvisors websites.</p>
	<p><strong>Analytics Tools and Third Party Cookies:</strong> Edvisors uses temporary cookies to help us determine how people travel through our site. A temporary cookie expires when you close your browser. This website also uses third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to collect information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use this information only to improve this site. Such tools use permanent cookies to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Edvisors. Third-parties providing such analytics tools may also transfer this information to other third-parties where required to do so by law, or where such third-parties process the information on their behalf. The third-party analytics provider cannot associate your IP address with your personally identifiable information. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by a third-party click tracking analytics provider in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>
	<p><strong>Online Advertising Networks and Third Party Cookies:</strong> Edvisors sometimes runs online ad campaigns that display Edvisors ads to you based on your likely interests. We may learn your likely interests when you use our websites and from other companies and websites that help us understand your likely interests. These types of ads are often called “interest-based ads” or “online behavioral advertising.” We hire “ad networks” to display these ads on websites across the Internet.</p>
	<p>The ad networks we hire to display these ads set their own cookies on your browser and use web beacons to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your likely interests. Our ad networks and Edvisors both learn which Edvisors ads are shown to you, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page the ads were displayed.</p>
	<p>Notwithstanding the above, we may share information collected from you with third party data providers including web log data and/or hashed email addresses. Third party data providers may place anonymous cookies on your browser to receive customized ads or content, which you can opt out of at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>

	<h3 id="childrens-privacy-policy">Children’s Privacy Policy</h3>
	<p>This Web site is not directed or otherwise promoted for use by children under the age of thirteen (13). Edvisors does not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our websites about children under age thirteen. If a child whom we know to be under age thirteen sends personal information to us online, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify parents or seek parental consent, and will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. We are not, however, responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose websites may contain links to ours. Because we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third-parties. We do not knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information via our site.</p>
	
	<h3 id="protect-information">How Do You Protect My Information?</h3>
	<p>We take the security of your personal information very seriously, and have implemented policies and procedures designed to safeguard it. To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we have implemented both online and offline security measures such as computer safeguards (firewalls and passwords) and securing servers and buildings where your information is stored. We require all third party advertising and marketing partners with whom we share your information to make reasonable efforts to protect your information.</p>
	
	<h3 id="use-information">How Do You Use My Information?</h3>

	<p>We use Technical Information to operate, administer, test and improve our sites, and to customize and improve the user experience.</p>
	
	<h3 id="share-information">How Do You Share My Information?</h3>
	<p><strong>Edvisors Sites:</strong> The sites that constitute the Edvisors Network all have access to and use information about you for the purposes described above. If you prefer not to receive marketing materials from Edvisors, you may <a href="http://www.edvisors.com/contact/opt-out/" target="_blank">opt out</a>.</p>

If you prefer not to receive marketing materials from third parties, you may <a href="http://www.edvisors.com/contact/opt-out/" target="_blank">opt out</a>.</p>

	<p><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> From time to time we may use third parties to perform specific services, such as sending emails or newsletters to Edvisors users. If we use a third party to provide specific services, then information (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third-party service providers are only allowed to use personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the specific services requested by Edvisors. The third-party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third-party sites found on our sites.
