</p>
<p><strong>An overview of the information that Bonnier  may&nbsp;collect </strong></p>
<p>You are  able to take advantage of many Bonnier products,  services, and websites without providing any information that personally  identifies you.&nbsp; We only collect  personally-identifying information when you voluntarily submit it to&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>Sometimes,  we need personally-identifying information in order to provide you with the  products and services that you request.&nbsp;  Depending upon the product or service, we may ask you for a variety of  personally-identifying information.&nbsp; This  might include, for example, your name, address, e-mail address, telephone  number, gender, and birth date.&nbsp; We may also ask for other information about  you, such as your credit card information (when you are making a purchase),  interests, income, or education level.&nbsp;  We consider certain identifying information "sensitive."&nbsp; This includes your credit card number, income  level, or any other information that would normally be considered&nbsp;confidential.</p>
<p>You may  choose not to provide us with any personally-identifying information.&nbsp; In that case, you can still access and use  many portions of our websites; however, you will not  be able to access and use those portions of any Bonnier  website that require your personal&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>Many  Bonnier websites include community features, such as online forums and message  boards.&nbsp; Information that is posted in  these areas becomes public information and the use that any third party makes  of this information is beyond our ability to control.&nbsp; You should exercise caution before disclosing  any personally-identifying information in these public venues.&nbsp; If you elect to submit content that includes  information that can be used to identify you, you must assume that the content  can and will be displayed on any website on the&nbsp;Internet.</p>
<p>At some Bonnier sites and through certain promotions, you can submit  personally-identifying information about other people.&nbsp; For example, you might submit a person's name  and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card; or, if you order a gift  online or offline and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit  the recipient's name and address.&nbsp; Some  Bonnier websites also provide referral services to help you inform a friend  about our websites, products, or services.&nbsp;  The types of personally-identifying information that we collect about  other people at pages like these may include the person's name, address, e-mail  address, or telephone number.&nbsp; We will  only ask you for the information about your friend that we need in order to do  what you&nbsp;request.</p>
<p>In some  circumstances, we also collect non-personally-identifying information.&nbsp; When you visit a Bonnier  website, we may collect information such as the type of browser you use, your  operating system, your <span class="caps">IP</span> address, and the domain name of your Internet Service  Provider.&nbsp; This information, by itself,  does not permit individual identification, meaning that you will remain  anonymous.&nbsp; However, if you elect to  provide us with personally-identifying information during your visit, that  information may be linked to your <span class="caps">IP</span>&nbsp;address.</p>
<p>When you  visit our websites, we may send one or more cookies – small, removable data  files – to your computer.&nbsp; We use cookies  to uniquely identify your browser, which allows us to enhance and personalize  your online experience at Bonnier websites.&nbsp; For example, cookies allow us to recognize  you when you return to a website and present relevant content to you when you  visit.&nbsp; Most browsers are initially set  up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to warn you when  cookies are sent, or to refuse all cookies.&nbsp;  Some of the features and services of Bonnier  websites may not operate properly if your cookies are disabled.&nbsp; Cookies, by themselves, do not provide us  with any personally-identifying&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>On our  websites, we may also use tiny graphic images called pixel tags, web beacons,  or clear gifs.&nbsp; These tiny images help us  to analyze our users' online behavior and collect other data, such as page  views or advertising responses.&nbsp; Pixel  tags also allow us to send you e-mail in a format that you can read, and let us  know when you have opened an e-mail message from us.&nbsp; Pixel tags may also be used to deliver  cookies.&nbsp; Some of our websites also use  third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit. These companies  may use non-personally-identifying information about your visits to this and  other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of  interest to&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>We work  with reputable third parties that provide data tracking and collection  technologies in order&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Present or serve the advertisements you may see at Bonnier&nbsp;websites;</li>
<li>Deliver and track e-mail&nbsp;communications;</li>
<li>Process purchase orders through e-commerce&nbsp;transactions;</li>
<li>Fulfill print and digital subscription orders;&nbsp;and</li>
<li>Provide marketing leads to third-party organizations (where you have agreed to  allow us to do&nbsp;so).</li>
</ul>
<p>These companies may  collect information about you on our behalf.&nbsp;  We require that these parties agree to process any such information  based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any  other appropriate confidentiality and security&nbsp;measures.</p>
<p>Bonnier  websites sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are  sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties.&nbsp; By virtue of their sponsorship, these third  parties may obtain personally-identifying information that visitors voluntarily  submit to them in order to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or  promotion.&nbsp; Bonnier has no control over  the third-party sponsors' use of this information.&nbsp; If a third-party sponsor beyond our control  will obtain information that you supply us, we will notify you at the time we  collect the information from you.&nbsp; For  certain promotions, only those who provide us with the requested  personally-identifying information will be able to order products, programs,  and services, or otherwise participate in the promotion's activities and&nbsp;offerings.</p>
<p>Some of our  websites contain links to other sites.&nbsp;  By clicking on these links, you will leave the website operated by  Bonnier and this Privacy Policy will no longer apply.&nbsp; These other sites' information practices may  be different than ours.&nbsp; You should  consult the other sites' privacy notices, as we have no control over  information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third&nbsp;parties.</p>
<p><strong>How we use the information we&nbsp;collect</strong></p>
<p>We use the  personally-identifying information that you provide us to fulfill your requests  for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about  offerings, and to offer you other products, programs, or services that we  believe may be of interest to you.&nbsp; We  sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you  when you have won one of our contests, when we make  changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online  newsletter, or to contact you about your account with&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>We may  syndicate the publicly available content of our community areas to unaffiliated  third-party websites, using <span class="caps">RSS</span> or other&nbsp;technologies.</p>
<p>We will use  the personally-identifying information that you provide about others only as  necessary to provide the products or services that you have requested; for  example, to enable us to send them your gifts or cards.&nbsp; If you provide us someone else's  personally-identifying information for referral purposes, we may use that  information to invite them to visit our websites or to provide them information  about our products or&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>If you  provide us with your e-mail and/or postal address, we may include that address  in e-mail and/or postal address lists that we sell, trade, or rent to third parties.&nbsp; Before sharing your e-mail or postal address  with companies not owned by Bonnier who want to market products or services to  you, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out.&nbsp; You may also opt out of the receipt of any  marketing materials from Bonnier as detailed&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>We may transfer your  sensitive personally-identifying information to other Bonnier  offices for internal management and administrative purposes.&nbsp; In addition, your personal data will be  transferred to other Bonnier offices where necessary  for the performance or conclusion of our contractual obligations to you or for  your benefit.&nbsp; Transfers of  personally-identifying information may also be made where necessary for the  establishment, exercise, or defense of legal&nbsp;claims.</p>
<p>Bonnier will  only share your sensitive personal information with outside companies or  individuals in any of the following limited&nbsp;circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we use trusted businesses or persons to process personal information on  our behalf.&nbsp; Before sharing any personal  information with outside parties, we require that these parties agree to  process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this  Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security&nbsp;measures.</li>
<li>When we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure  is necessary to (a) comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal process;  (b) enforce the applicable Terms of Service or other agreements and policies on  the Company's Websites; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud,  security, or technical issues; or (d) protect against imminent harm to the  rights, property, or safety or Bonnier, its users, or the public as required or  permitted by&nbsp;law.</li>
<li>When you consent.&nbsp; Before we share your  sensitive personal information outside of the previously listed circumstances, we  will ask you for permission first.&nbsp;  Please note that this only applies to sensitive information, as defined  above.<br>
    We may also  use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users for  any legal purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible  advertisers and partners.&nbsp; In no event  will this aggregated data contain any information that could be used to  identify individual users of our products or&nbsp;services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How we protect the safety and integrity of  the information we&nbsp;collect</strong></p>
<p>We take  appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural measures to safeguard and  protect your personal information.&nbsp; We  use a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication, to  maintain the confidentiality of your personal information.&nbsp; We store your personal information on systems  behind firewalls that are only accessible to a limited number of persons, each  of whom is required to keep the information confidential.&nbsp; We also take appropriate measures to secure  the transmission of sensitive personal information from your computer to the  Company's computers.&nbsp; When you transmit  sensitive personal information to us, like credit card information, we offer  the use of a secure connection to our servers.&nbsp;  To the extent you select the secure connection method or your browser  supports such functionality, all credit card account information that you  supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (<span class="caps">SSL</span>) technology.&nbsp; Regardless of these measures, no system  connected to the Internet or data transmission sent over the Internet can be  guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; We will  provide notice if we become aware of any security breach that may affect any  sensitive personal information pertaining to you that we have stored on our&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>Bonnier employees, agents, and contractors who have access to  personally-identifying information are required to protect this information in  a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and may not use the  information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are  performing for Bonnier.&nbsp; These  individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to  discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to  meet these&nbsp;obligations.</p>
<p>Bonnier  only collects personal information that is relevant to the purposes for which  it will be used.&nbsp; Though we do take  appropriate steps to review and update the information that we store to ensure  that it is accurate, complete, and current, we also depend on you to update or  correct your personal information when&nbsp;necessary.</p>
