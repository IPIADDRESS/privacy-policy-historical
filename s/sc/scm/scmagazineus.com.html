        <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Like many web sites, Haymarket may
            also use pixel tags, also known as beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, to improve
            our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional
            campaigns, as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response
            measurement. Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based
            applications, also for the purpose of traffic measurement. We may also implement
            pixel tags provided by other companies, for the same purpose. You can disable pixel
            tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or
            there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most
            advertisements.<br>
