   <ul>
        <li>
                In general, you may visit this Web site without
                identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.
                 
            </li>
        <li>
            As you browse our Web site, the site collects
                log file, IP address of your computer, and other standard tracking data we use to
                evaluate site traffic and usage patterns. Such information is aggregated with tracking
                data from all site visitors. We will use the information to personalize the site
                according to your preferences based on the aggregated information. We also use the
                aggregated information to evaluate products and services we may offer to you.
               
            </li>
        <li>Some portions of this Web site may require you
                to give us personally identifiable information such as your name, job title, company,
                physical mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers (Personal Information)
                and, if applicable, financial information such as your credit card information (Financial
                Information), for, without limitation, (i) registration for attendance at certain Haymarket trade shows, conferences and events; and (ii) subscriptions to our publications.
                If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin
                boards or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys or contest entries,
                any information provided in such communications may be collected as Personal Information.
               
            </li>
        <li>If you elect to provide us Personal Information,
                we use it primarily to deliver the service you requested. Other uses of Personal
                Information are described elsewhere in this Policy.</li>
        <li>If you submit Financial Information, we use that
                information primarily to verify your credit and collect payments for your purchases,
                orders, registrations etc.
               
            </li>
        <li>Haymarket uses a third party to process credit
                card transactions and does not store financial information, such as credit card
                information on its website.

            Information Sharing
            <br>
        </b>
            <br>
            Unless you opt-out, we share your Personal Information with Haymarket's affiliates
            and partners and third parties licensed to access your Personal Information by any
            of the foregoing.
            <br>
            Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal
            Information and your Financial Information private and will not share it with third
            parties, unless such disclosure is necessary t (a) comply with a court order or
            other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) 
            enforce our terms
            of service.
          
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Several companies unaffiliated with
            Haymarket provide email deployment services for our email messages. The personally
            identifiable information, such as e-mail address, we provide to these vendors for
            the purposes of e-mail deployment is only used by them for that purpose and not
            for any other business activity.
            
        
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to comply with the Federal
            CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide lists of customers who have opted-out
            of email promotion for Haymarket products to other companies, so they can be suppressed
            from mailings those companies send on
            Haymarket’s behalf. In addition, if you unsubscribe
            from a mailing we send to our own list
            on behalf of a third party, your removal
            instruction may also be supplied to the third party and added to their own suppression
            file. If you continue receiving email after opting out, please contact us at web@haymarketmedia.com.

            of the user visiting the site, and enables the site to return the results the browser

        <b>Pixel Tags</b></p>
    <p>
        Like many web sites, Haymarket may
            also use pixel tags, also known as beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, to improve
            our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional
            campaigns, as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response
            measurement. Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based
            applications, also for the purpose of traffic measurement. We may also implement
            pixel tags provided by other companies, for the same purpose. You can disable pixel
            tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or
            there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most
            advertisements.<br>

            <b>Opt-out Option

            to request Haymarket not to e-mail them advertising and promotional information.
            Should visitors accept promotional e-mail from Haymarket, any e-mail they receive
            will include instructions on how to be removed from Haymarket's promotional e-mail
