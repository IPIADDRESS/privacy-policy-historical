            <span>Haymarket Media Inc.</span>("Haymarket") has created this privacy statement 
            to demonstrate our firm commitment to protect your privacy and to fully disclose what 
            information we collect and how we use it. Please note your use of our Digital Offering 
            is also governed by the Terms and Conditions of use.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Information Collection and Dissemination </strong>
        </p>
        <span><strong>General Principles </strong></span>
        <ul>
            <li>In general, you may visit this Digital Offering or use the companion mobile applications
                (collectively referred to as the "Digital Offering")without identifying yourself
                or revealing any personal information. </li>
            <li>As you browse our Digital Offering, the Digital Offering collects log file, IP address
                of your computer, and other standard tracking data we use to evaluate Digital Offering
                traffic and usage patterns. Such information is aggregated with tracking data from
                all Digital Offering visitors. We will use the information to personalize the Digital
                Offering according to your preferences based on the aggregated information. We also
                use the aggregated information to evaluate products and services we may offer to
                you. </li>
            <li>Some portions of this Digital Offering may require you to give us personally identifiable
                information such as your name, job title, company, physical mailing address, e-mail
                address, telephone and fax numbers (Personal Information) and, if applicable, financial
                information such as your credit card information (Financial Information), for, without
                limitation, (i) registration for attendance at certain Haymarket trade shows, conferences
                and events; and (ii) subscriptions to our publications. If you communicate with
                us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards or forums,
                or otherwise complete online forms, surveys or contest entries, any information
                provided in such communications may be collected as Personal Information. </li>
            <li>If you elect to provide us Personal Information, we use it primarily to deliver
                the service you requested. Other uses of Personal Information are described elsewhere
                in this Policy.</li>
            <li>If you submit Financial Information, we use that information primarily to verify
                your credit and collect payments for your purchases, orders, registrations etc.
            </li>
            <li>Haymarket uses a third party to process credit card transactions and does not store
                financial information, such as credit card information on its website. We do retain
                the last four digits of the credit card number solely for customer service purposes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Information Sharing</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless you opt-out, we share your Personal Information with Haymarket's affiliates
            and partners and third parties licensed to access your Personal Information by any
            of the foregoing. To opt-out, send us an email to <a href="mailto:Newslettersupport@haymarketmedia.com?Subject=Customer Service - SC Magazine">

            Several companies unaffiliated with Haymarket provide email deployment services
            for our email messages. The personally identifiable information, such as e-mail
            address, we provide to these vendors for the purposes of e-mail deployment is only
            used by them for that purpose and not for any other business activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide lists
            of customers who have opted-out of email promotion for Haymarket products to other
            companies, so they can be suppressed from mailings those companies send on Haymarket’s
            behalf. In addition, if you unsubscribe from a mailing we send to our own list on
            behalf of a third party, your removal instruction may also be supplied to the third
            party and added to their own suppression file. If you continue receiving email after
            opting out, please contact us at <a href="mailto:web@haymarketmedia.com">web@haymarketmedia.com.</a>

            <strong>Pixel Tags</strong></p>
        <p>
            Like many web sites, Haymarket may also use pixel tags, also known as beacons, spotlight
            tags or web bugs, to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior,
            and response to promotional campaigns, as a supplement to our server logs and other
            methods of traffic and response measurement. Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction
            with small Javascript-based applications, also for the purpose of traffic measurement.
            We may also implement pixel tags provided by other companies, for the same purpose.
            You can disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and
            disable Javascript; or there are commercial software packages available that can
            omit pixel tags and most advertisements.
