        	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	
	
<span class="bold_header_blue">Effective Date: April 2, 2007 </span>	
	
<p class="body_copy">At ScanScout we recognize that privacy is important and we are committed to ensuring the privacy of personas that use the ScanScout website ("End-Users"), located at www.ScanScout.com ("Site").  This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes what information is collected from End-Users and how such information is used and disclosed.  Terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the End-Users of our Site.  Terms "we," "us," and "our" refer to ScanScout, its subsidiaries and affiliates.</p>

<p class="body_copy">PLEASE READ THIS POLICY CAREFULLY SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES.  BY USING THIS SITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.  WE MAY PERIODICALLY MAKE CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS POLICY AND IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMAIN INFORMED ABOUT ANY SUCH CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO PERIODICALLY REVIEW THIS POLICY TO STAY INFORMED ABOUT HOW WE ARE PROTECTING THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT.  YOU AGREE THAT YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THIS SITE CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS POLICY AND ANY FURTHER UPDATES AND MODIFICATIONS TO THIS POLICY, AS SUCH MAY BE MADE BY SCANSCOUT FROM TIME TO TIME.</p>

<p class="body_copy"><span class="bold_header_blue">I. What type of information do we collect and how do we use it?</span></p>

<p class="body_copy">Information gathered online can generally be categorized as either anonymous or personally identifiable, as follows: </p>

<p class="body_copy">1. <u>Personally Identifiable Information</u>. Personally identifiable information is information you provide to us that is uniquely associated with you, such as your name, physical mailing address, email address and telephone number.  Information identifying an entity other than an individual (e.g., a corporation, partnership, joint venture and so forth) does not constitute personally identifiable information. </p>

<p class="body_copy">2. <u>Anonymous Information</u>. Anonymous information is general information that cannot be traced back to a specific individual.  For instance, we know how many queries we receive each day, but we generally do not know the names and e-mail addresses of the personas submitting the queries.  Anonymous information can also include "aggregate data". Aggregate data is data we collect about a group or category of features, services or individuals, from which individual identities have been removed. For example, information about how you use or purchase a feature may be collected and combined with information about how others use or purchase the same feature, without any personal information included in the resulting data.  ScanScout uses aggregate data to help identify trends and understand End-Users needs so we can provide better features and services.</p>
 
<p class="body_copy"><span class="bold_header">How We Collect Personally Identifiable Information?</span></p>

<p class="body_copy">You provide personally identifiable information to us in a number of ways when you visit our Site or use the various services and activities available on our Site, such as: 
</p><ul>
<li>Register to be a member of Site;</li>
<li>Register to participate in programs or services offered by ScanScout;</li>
<li>Participate in a survey;</li>
<li>Participate or make postings in any forums or other interactive areas;</li>
<li>Submit and/or post an article or comment to the Site and voluntarily include your name or other personal information (including, without limitation, any personally identifying photographs or images you submit and/or post);</li>
<li>Contact us by email for any reason (such as to request customer service, provide us with your comments/feedback, submit a job application, submit a resume, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p></p>			

<p class="body_copy"></p>
<p class="body_copy"><span class="bold_header">How We Use Personally Identifiable Information?</span></p>

<p class="body_copy">We generally use personally identifiable information to process your requests or transactions, and provide you with features and services you requested. For example, we use the information we collect to: 
</p><ul>
<li>Contact you for administrative purposes or provide you with customer service;</li>
<li>Complete transactions requested by you or to verify your use of the Site;</li>
<li>Respond to any questions, problems, complaints or feedback requests;</li>
<li>Organize the Site to better serve you and customize or develop our features and services;</li>
<li>Send you emails or other communications containing information about features and services that you might request or find of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p class="body_copy">Personal information provided on our Site may be linked together or merged with other personal information we obtain about you so that we may better understand your needs and inform you about our features or services and those of our business partners. </p>

<p class="body_copy">We do not sell, rent or share personal information with third parties without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy.  We share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate our business.  These functions may include: analysis data, providing marketing assistance and processing payment transactions.  In all cases we limited the information shared with our third-party vendors to that which is necessary to carry out those functions.  We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Policy and use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information.  We are not, however, responsible for any information you provide to third party vendors directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.  </p>

<p class="body_copy">We also disclose personal information where it is needed to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill and collect for amounts owed to us, to protect our or our End-Users' rights, property or safety; to protect our End-Users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our site, or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person required disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay. </p>

<p class="body_copy">Additionally, information about our End-Users may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.</p>

<p class="body_copy"><span class="bold_header">How Do We Collect Anonymous Information?</span></p>

<p class="body_copy">General user data, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, pages you visited, and the date and time of your visit, is automatically collected through the use of "cookies".  Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by a website to give you a unique identification. Cookies also keep track of services you have used, record registration information regarding your login name and password, record your preferences and keep you logged into the Site.  You can opt out of receiving a cookie by changing your browser settings to prevent the receipt of cookies.  Since each web browser is different, we recommend that you please look through your browser "Help" file to learn the correct way to modify your cookies set-up.  Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of the functionality and site offerings available via the Site.  Please also keep in mind that you may get cookies through sites linked to the Site and we do not control these cookies. </p>

<p class="body_copy">We may use, and allow third parties to use, web beacons on the Site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes. Web beacons are small, graphic images on web pages, web-based documents, or in e-mail messages that allow us or third parties to monitor who is visiting the Site or if the email has been read. Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. Web beacons may be linked to your personal information. We may also use third-party ad servers or network advertisers, to deliver ads to you. These third-party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons or other technology to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Site in order to present advertisements that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice or whether you can opt out of having this information used by third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads, visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" class="link">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>. </p>

<p class="body_copy"><span class="bold_header">How Do We Use Anonymous Information?</span></p>

<p class="body_copy">We may use automatically collected information and cookies information for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to:  
</p><ul>
<li>Remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site;</li>
<li>Provide custom, personalized content, and information;</li>
<li>Monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;</li>
<li>Monitor aggregate usage metrics, such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p class="body_copy">We treat anonymous information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the personally identifying information mentioned above and, in those cases, will only use it on aggregate basis. </p>

<p class="body_copy">Additionally, information about our End-Users may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets. </p>

<p class="body_copy"><span class="bold_header_blue">II. Security.</span></p>

<p class="body_copy">We use reasonable security measures in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. However, we cannot guarantee protection of all information in all cases.  For instance, we cannot guarantee protection against interception, misappropriation, misuse, or alteration, or that your information will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.  Additionally, we have absolutely no control over the security of other sites you might visit, interact with or do business with. </p>

<p class="body_copy">If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.  By using the Site or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Site.  ScanScout may post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs.  We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.  To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at ScanScout, Inc., Attn: Privacy Matters, 295 Devonshire Street, 4th floor, Boston, MA 02110 USA. </p>

<p class="body_copy"><span class="bold_header_blue">III. External Web Sites.</span></p>

<p class="body_copy">Our Site contains links to external websites.  These are provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third party sites.  Any personal information you provide on linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy.  Please learn about the privacy and security practices and policies of external websites before providing them with personal information. </p>

<p class="body_copy"><span class="bold_header_blue">IV. Special policy regarding personally identifiable information of children.</span></p>

<p class="body_copy">In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we do not knowingly collect or maintain information from End-Users under age 13 without parental consent.  We do not monitor the age of our End-Users.  However, if you are under the age of 13, you should not use the Site nor submit personal identifying information to ScanScout without the consent of your parent or guardian.  This Site is not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 13.  Any End-User using the Site represent to ScanScout that they are 13 years of age or older. </p>

<p class="body_copy"><span class="bold_header_blue">V. International Users.</span></p>

<p class="body_copy">The Site is hosted in the United States.  If you are an End-User accessing the Site from the European Union, Australia, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as such other regions.  Personal information collected on this web site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which ScanScout maintains facilities, and by using this Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>

<p class="body_copy"><span class="bold_header_blue">VI. Your California Privacy Rights.</span></p>

<p class="body_copy">Under California law, California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship the following: (i) a list of the categories of personal information (e.g., name, address, e-mail address, and the type of services provided to the customer) that a business has disclosed to third parties, during the immediately preceding calendar year, for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, and (ii) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above information, please e-mail us at: privacy@ScanScout.com, or write to us at ScanScout, Inc., Attn: Privacy Matters, 295 Devonshire Street, 4th floor, Boston, MA 02111, USA, with a reference to California Disclosure Information.</p>

<p class="body_copy">We will respond to such written requests within thirty (30) days following receipt at the e-mail or mailing address stated above.

		<span class="sidebar_header">Opt-Out<br>Privacy Policy</span>
		<p class="body_copy">ScanScout offers users the choice to select an "opt-out cookie" to prevent information from being uniquely associated with their browsers and ad optimization. Users can then opt-out of ScanScout's ad-serving cookies without erasing or altering other cookies associated with their browser.</p>

<p class="body_copy">When possible, we try to match the ads that we show you to your interests. We call this "ad optimization," (sometimes also called ad matching) and we do this in order to make the ads you see more relevant and useful for you. Ad matching uses data about your visits to ScanScout's ad network and about the ads you view and click. </p>

<p class="body_copy">By selecting an opt-out cookie, ads delivered to your browser by ScanScout are targeted based only on the non-personally identifiable information that is available from the Internet environment, including information about your browser type and Internet service provider, and the general content of the site or page your browser is viewing. Also, please note that if you choose an opt-out cookie, ScanScout is unable to recognize your browser from one visit to the next, and you may therefore receive the same ad repeatedly. By receiving this cookie, ScanScout systems will know that you have opted out and will not attempt to assign other cookies in the future. Since the ScanScout opt-out cookie does not contain a unique user number, it does not allow us to identify your browser. If you opt-out the ads we show you will be more general and less relevant to you. Opting-out will not turn off ads.</p>
