                            an "opt-out cookie" to prevent information from being uniquely associated with their browsers and ad optimization. Users can then opt-out of ScanScout's ad-serving cookies without erasing or altering other cookies associated with their browser.<br>

                          When possible, we try to match the ads that we show you to your interests. We call this "ad optimization," (sometimes also called ad matching) and we do this in order to make the ads you see more relevant and useful for you. Ad matching uses data about your visits to ScanScout's ad network and about the ads you view and click.
<br>
<br>

By selecting an opt-out cookie, ads delivered to your browser by ScanScout are targeted based only on the non-personally identifiable information that is available from the Internet environment, including information about your browser type and Internet service provider, and the general content of the site or page your browser is viewing. Also, please note that if you choose an opt-out cookie, ScanScout is unable to recognize your browser from one visit to the next, and you may therefore receive the same ad repeatedly. By receiving this cookie, ScanScout systems will know that you have opted out and will not attempt to assign other cookies in the future. Since the ScanScout opt-out cookie does not contain a unique user number, it does not allow us to identify your browser. If you opt-out the ads we show you will be more general and less relevant to you. Opting-out will not turn off ads.

                    <p><span class="h2 hblue">I. What type of information do we collect and how do we use it?</span><br>
                    Information gathered online can generally be categorized as either
                    anonymous or personally identifiable, as follows:
                    </p><p>
                    1. <u>Personally Identifiable Information</u>.  Personally
                    identifiable information is information you provide to us that is
                    uniquely associated with you, such as your name, physical mailing
                    address, email address and telephone number.&nbsp; Information
                    identifying an entity other than an individual (e.g., a corporation,
                    partnership, joint venture and so forth) does not constitute
                    personally identifiable information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                                        2. <u>Anonymous
                      Information</u>.  Anonymous information is general information that
                    cannot be traced back to a specific individual.&nbsp; For instance,
                    we know how many queries we receive each day, but we generally do not
                    know the names and e-mail addresses of the personas submitting the
                    queries.&nbsp; Anonymous information can also include "aggregate
                    data". Aggregate data is data we collect about a group or
                    category of features, services or individuals, from which individual
                    identities have been removed. For example, information about how you
                    use or purchase a feature may be collected and combined with
                    information about how others use or purchase the same feature,
                    without any personal information included in the resulting data.&nbsp;
                    ScanScout uses aggregate data to help identify trends and understand
                    End-Users needs so we can provide better features and services.
                    </p>

                    information provided on our Site may be linked together or merged

                    We do not sell,

                    prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this
                    Policy.&nbsp; We share personal information with third-party vendors
                    who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate
                    our business.&nbsp; These functions may include: analysis data,
                    providing marketing assistance and processing payment transactions.&nbsp;
                    In all cases we limited the information shared with our third-party
                    vendors to that which is necessary to carry out those functions.&nbsp;
                    We require that these parties agree to process such information in
                    compliance with this Policy and use reasonable efforts to limit their
                    use of such information.&nbsp; We are not, however, responsible for

                    </p><p>
                    We also
                    disclose personal information where it is needed to comply with the

                    the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes.
                    Web beacons are small, graphic images on web pages, web-based
                    documents, or in e-mail messages that allow us or third parties to
                    monitor who is visiting the Site or if the email has been read. Web
                    beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is
                    sent to, the URL of the page the web beacon comes from and the time
                    it was viewed. Web beacons may be linked to your personal
                    information. We may also use third-party ad servers or network
                    advertisers, to deliver ads to you. These third-party ad servers may
