At ScanScout we recognize that privacy is important and we are
committed to ensuring the privacy of personas that use the ScanScout
website ("<u>End-Users</u>"), located at www.ScanScout.com
("<u>Site</u>").&nbsp; This Privacy Policy
("<u>Policy</u>") describes what information is collected
from End-Users and how such information is used and disclosed.&nbsp;
Terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer
to the End-Users of our Site.&nbsp; Terms "we,"
"us," and "our" refer to ScanScout, its
subsidiaries and affiliates.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
PLEASE
READ THIS POLICY CAREFULLY SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PRIVACY
PRACTICES.&nbsp; BY USING THIS SITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS
POLICY.&nbsp; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY,
PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.&nbsp; WE MAY PERIODICALLY MAKE CHANGES OR
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS POLICY AND IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMAIN
INFORMED ABOUT ANY SUCH CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS.  CONSEQUENTLY, WE
ENCOURAGE YOU TO PERIODICALLY REVIEW THIS POLICY TO STAY INFORMED
ABOUT HOW WE ARE PROTECTING THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT.&nbsp; YOU
AGREE THAT YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THIS SITE CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT
WITH THIS POLICY AND ANY FURTHER UPDATES AND MODIFICATIONS TO THIS
POLICY, AS SUCH MAY BE MADE BY SCANSCOUT FROM TIME TO TIME.<br>

<br>

<h2>I. What type of information do we collect and how do we use it?
</h2>

Information gathered online can generally be categorized as either
anonymous or personally identifiable, as follows: <br>
<br>

1. <u>Personally Identifiable Information</u>.  Personally
identifiable information is information you provide to us that is
uniquely associated with you, such as your name, physical mailing
address, email address and telephone number.&nbsp; Information
identifying an entity other than an individual (e.g., a corporation,
partnership, joint venture and so forth) does not constitute
personally identifiable information.<br>

<br>

2.	<u>Anonymous
Information</u>.  Anonymous information is general information that
cannot be traced back to a specific individual.&nbsp; For instance,
we know how many queries we receive each day, but we generally do not
know the names and e-mail addresses of the personas submitting the
queries.&nbsp; Anonymous information can also include "aggregate
data". Aggregate data is data we collect about a group or
category of features, services or individuals, from which individual
identities have been removed. For example, information about how you
use or purchase a feature may be collected and combined with
information about how others use or purchase the same feature,
without any personal information included in the resulting data.&nbsp;
ScanScout uses aggregate data to help identify trends and understand
End-Users needs so we can provide better features and services.<br>

<br>

</li><li>
Contact us by email for any reason (such as to request customer
service, provide us with your comments/feedback, submit a job
application, submit a resume, etc.).<br>

</li></ul>

<br>

<h3>How We Use Personally Identifiable Information?</h3>

We generally use personally
identifiable information to process your requests or transactions,
and provide you with features and services you requested. For
example, we use the information we collect to:<br>

for administrative purposes or provide you with customer service;<br>

</li><li> Send you emails or other

</li></ul>

<br>

Personal
information provided on our Site may be linked together or merged
with other personal information we obtain about you so that we may
better understand your needs and inform you about our features or
services and those of our business partners.<br>

<br>

We do not sell,
rent or share personal information with third parties without your
prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this
Policy.&nbsp; We share personal information with third-party vendors
who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate
our business.&nbsp; These functions may include: analysis data,
providing marketing assistance and processing payment transactions.&nbsp;
In all cases we limited the information shared with our third-party
vendors to that which is necessary to carry out those functions.&nbsp;
We require that these parties agree to process such information in
compliance with this Policy and use reasonable efforts to limit their
use of such information.&nbsp; We are not, however, responsible for
any information you provide to third party vendors directly, and we
encourage you to become familiar with their practices before
disclosing information directly to them.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

We also
disclose personal information where it is needed to comply with the
law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or
apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate,
render, bill and collect for amounts owed to us, to protect our or
our End-Users' rights, property or safety; to protect our End-Users
from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our site, or if we
reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of
death or serious physical injury to any person required disclosure of
communications or justifies disclosure of records without
delay.<br>

<br>

Additionally, information about our End-Users may be
disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale
of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency,
bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable
information could be transferred to third parties as one of our
business assets.<br>

<br>

<h3>How Do We Collect Anonymous Information?</h3>

General user data, such as your computer's
Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type,
pages you visited, and the date and time of your visit, is
automatically collected through the use of "cookies".&nbsp;

to give you a unique identification. Cookies also keep track of
services you have used, record registration information regarding
your login name and password, record your preferences and keep you
logged into the Site.&nbsp; You can opt out of receiving a cookie by

We may use,

monitor who is visiting the Site or if the email has been read. Web
beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is
sent to, the URL of the page the web beacon comes from and the time

information. We may also use third-party ad servers or network
advertisers, to deliver ads to you. These third-party ad servers may
use cookies, web beacons or other technology to collect
non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Site
in order to present advertisements that may be of interest to you. If
you would like more information about this practice or whether you

<br>

<br>

Additionally, information about our End-Users may be
disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale

business assets.<br>

<h2>II.	Security.</h2>

so at your own risk.&nbsp; Additionally, we have absolutely no
