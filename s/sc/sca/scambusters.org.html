Here's a quick summary of our privacy policy: we don't Share and we don't SPAM.
<br><br>
At Lanford Inc., we are as committed to your privacy as you are. At least.
<br><br>
After all, it's okay for you to tell people stuff about yourself. It's not at all okay for us to do it without your consent. So, here's how we handle that.
<br><br>
In order to provide the services you want, we need varying levels of information.
<br><br>
If you're just browsing the site, all we need to know is what page you want to see. If you want to subscribe to one or more of our newsletters or mini-courses, we'll need an email address to send it to.
<br><br>
If you want to order stuff from us, we'll need a little more. It can be as much as your name, address, personal interests, and credit card number and expiration date.
<br><br>
In short, we'll ask for only what we need to give you what you want.
<br><br>
We will use the information we collect about you only to help us improve services to you, to provide you with the products you have requested, and/or to let you know about additional products or services that may be of interest to you.
<br><br>
We don't sell, trade, rent, share, or otherwise divulge any information you give us to anyone else, at any time, for any reason without your prior consent. (Unless the law says we gotta... Then we gotta.)
<br><br>
We will occasionally share information with business partners when it is necessary to deliver the products and services we provide.
<br><br>
We also invite selected third parties to participate in offers we feel would be attractive to you. We don't give any of your personal information to these parties. We negotiate the offer and contact you ourselves with the details.
<br><br>
You may permanently refuse these promotional offers by sending any email to 

stop@svr.com.
<br><br>
BY USING THIS WEB SITE YOU CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BY LANFORD INC. IN THESE WAYS.

We'll track IP addresses, which is just computer talk for "What part of the Net is this person from?" This is useful for knowing general things about our visitors, but it tells us nothing at all about you personally.

If you let it, your browser may store "cookies" on your system. We use these to help you to personalize the site based on your preferences. They tell the system what to show you, but they don't tell us anything at all about you personally.

We produce reports for our affiliates, and reputable third party vendors. For example, we tell affiliates how many people clicked on an ad. They're based on overall numbers and averages, not individual usage. (In tech-speak this is called "aggregate data." Don't you love those fancy terms?)
