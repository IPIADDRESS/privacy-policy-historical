<p>This is the official privacy policy (”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span>“) for www.scandalist.com (”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Site</span>,” “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">we</span>,” “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">us</span>,” or “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">our</span>“), an Internet website offered in cooperation with the VH1 television channel or programming service (”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">VH1 Channel</span>“).  The VH1 Channel and the Site (together, “VH1″) are provided by MTV Networks (”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">MTVN</span>“), a division of Viacom International Inc. (together, MTVN and Viacom International Inc., the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parent Companies</span>“).  This Privacy Policy governs only the personally identifiable information (”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal Information</span>“) collected by the Site and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner or for any other purpose, or for or by any other MTVN programming channel, MTVN’s “Jobhunt” website, the Parent Companies and any subsidiaries and affiliates of the Parent Companies (collectively, “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Affiliates</span>“), or any other company, unless specifically stated.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Overview:  This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and inform you as to: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li> The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users of the Site and how that information is collected;</li>
<li> How we use your Personal Information;</li>
<li> The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third parties;</li>
<li> How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information collected about you by us; and</li>
<li> The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information.<a name="OLE_LINK5"></a><a name="OLE_LINK5"></a></li>
</ul>
<p>This Site is offered and made available only to users 13 years of age or older who reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions (”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">U.S.</span>“).  <strong>If you are not yet 13 years old</strong><strong> or the required greater age for certain features</strong><strong>, or do not reside in the U.S., please discontinue using the Site immediately, or if, for any reason, you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, </strong><strong>please do not participate in the features, activities and services that require you to provide your Personal Information.</strong> This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our <a href="http://www.scandalist.com/terms-of-use-agreement/" target="_self"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use Agreement</span></strong></a>. Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Terms of Use Agreement.  Both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement are legally binding on all users.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you.  Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting.  Notice of material changes to either document will be posted on the Site’s homepage and/or will be provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion.  However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates.</p>
<p>We are committed to protecting users’ privacy.  Keeping the Personal Information you share with us on the Site secure and ensuring your understanding of how we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information is important to us.  We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">unsubscribe</span>“) or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.</p>
<p>VH1 qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.  Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the <a href="mailto:editor@scandalist.com">Privacy Administrator</a><strong></strong>, or you may contact us via regular mail at:<a name="OLE_LINK7"><strong></strong></a></p>

</strong><strong>GENERAL PRIVACY INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Site is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S.  We make no representation that this Site is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations. By your participation in our Site activities, you certify that you are at least 13<strong> </strong>years of age or the required greater age for certain features and a resident of the U.S.  If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you participate in activities on this Site contrary to our policy that only U.S. residents are eligible for certain activities, you do so at your own risk and initiative, and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and national laws.  Please be aware that any Personal Information you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of this Site will be transferred to the U.S. and subject to U.S. law.  By using this Site, participating in any Site activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to this transfer and processing of Personal Information to and in the U.S., and in other countries that may not have an equivalent level of protection or a level of data protection considered adequate in the European Union or European Economic Area.  Consequently, you hereby waive any claims that may arise under the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or jurisdiction.  All users of the Site are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Site indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.  We may from time to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format.  We may also combine Personal Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from our Affiliates, marketing companies, or Advertisers (as defined in the <strong><a href="http://www.scandalist.com/terms-of-use-agreement/" target="_self"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use Agreement</span></a></strong>).  This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site, even if your use of or participation in any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>1.         Collection and Use of Personal Information:</strong><strong> </strong>When we use the term “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal Information</span>” we mean information such as your first/middle initial or name and last name, street address, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, instant-messenger nickname, blog or other personal website URL, date of birth, e-mail address, gender, ethnicity and any other information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you.  Personal Information also includes information about your personal preferences, survey responses and your transactions or relationship with us, if you have been a user of the Site or you have provided this type of information to any of the MTVN family of companies.  For example, to the extent we offer such services, if you order any of our various Products (as defined in the <a><strong></strong></a><strong><a href="http://www.scandalist.com/terms-of-use-agreement/" target="_self"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use Agreement</span></a></strong>), in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and maintain your billing address, shipping address, Product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information, your order number, and information about your computer’s internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (<em>e.g.,</em> the referring URL).  Your credit card or debit card number is classified as “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sensitive Personal Information</span>” and is collected via a secure transmission.</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information about you when you visit the Site and input information, whether you are registering to use any services, features or functions of the Site, participating in Promotions (as defined in the <a href="http://www.scandalist.com/terms-of-use-agreement/" target="_self"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use Agreement</span></strong></a>), ordering or purchasing Products or in the course of any other exchanges of information, transactions and activities.  We may use the information we obtain from you, including Personal Information, to tailor your experience on the Site, to display content we think may be of interest to you, or to let us customize what you see when you visit the Site according to your preferences and personal characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>a.  Collection of Personal Information During Registration.</strong> To the extent we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of the Site, you are required to select a user name and password (together, your “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">User ID</span>“), and may be required to also provide other Personal Information, such as your email address, first and last name, gender, date of birth, country and zip code.  Additional Personal Information may be requested during the registration process (but not required), such as cable/satellite provider, ethnic information, and annual income.  We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID<a name="_DV_M95"></a>.  Among other things, these kinds of information help us securely identify you as a registered or permitted user of the Site and our features and functions.  You will not be able to change your date of birth without sufficient verification.</p>
<p>All member benefits are free. As a registered user of the Site, from time to time, we may also provide you with certain options to subscribe to a selection of free email newsletters and other periodic information.  You may select such options by opting-in at the time of registration or by responding to an offer orinvitation at a later date.  You will also have the right to opt-out (unsubscribe) or change your preferences at any time by logging in with your User ID and changing the settings in your account.  You may also opt-out to particular email communications by responding to that email and using the “unsubscribe” or opt-out procedure included in that communication.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site in connection with your registration. You also agree to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>b. Collection of Personal Information During Registration or In Connection with Certain Features and Functions. </strong>During registration (and possibly at certain other times to enable your use of other features or functions or for security purposes), you will b</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
