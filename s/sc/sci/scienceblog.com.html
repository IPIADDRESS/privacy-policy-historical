<br>
<b>Information Collection and Use </b><br>
Science Blog is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. This policy describes the ways we collect and use this information. We reserve the right to change this policy.<br>
<br>
<b>Registration</b><br>
To access certain areas of this website a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact users about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as occupation and interests), but this is encouraged so we can provide a better experience on our site. <br>
user. <br>
<br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. If a user rejects the cookie, they will be unable to login to our site to access premium content. We do not use cookies to store sensitive information.  <br>
Some of our business partners, including advertisers, use cookies on our site. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.<br>
<br>
<b>Log Files</b><br>
We use Internet Protocol (IP) computer addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement on our site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
<b>Sharing</b><br>
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. <br>
We may partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. <br>
<br>
<b>Links</b><br>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Science Blog is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. <br>
<br>
<b>Newsletter</b><br>
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as e-mail address. <br>
<br>
<b>Surveys and Contests</b><br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site, and may be shared in aggregate with our partners.<br>
<br>
<b>Tell a Friend</b><br>
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about content on our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and e-mail address. Science Blog will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. Science Blog stores the message, the message header, and the sender’s IP address for the sole purpose of preventing inappropriate use of this service, such as spamming or flaming. <br>
<br>
<b>Security</b><br>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. <br>
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked (as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’). <br>
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an e-mail to webmaster@scienceblog.com.<br>
<br>
<b>Special Offers</b><br>
We may send new members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. We present the option to not receive the newsletter. <br>
<br>
<b>Site and Service Updates</b><br>
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via e-mail or phone. <br>
<br>
<b>Correcting/Updating Personal Information</b><br>
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us.<br>
<br>
<b>Choice/Opt-out</b><br>
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out by replying with unsubscribe in the subject line in the e-mail or using the Newsletter Subscribe/Unsubscribe page. Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.<br>
<br>
<b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
Science Blog reserves the right to change its privacy policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes prominently so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. <br>
