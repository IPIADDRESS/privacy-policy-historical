<center><h1>Scientific American Privacy Statement</h1></center>
<p>
<b>ScientificAmerican.com respects and protects the privacy of our users.</b> <br>
Please read the following statement to understand how your personal information will be treated. Note that by using the Services and/or the Sites you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when those changes are posted to the Site. Your continued use of the Services and the Site subsequent to any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes. Please review this statement periodically to ensure continuing familiarity with its most current provisions.
</p><p>
<b>What information do we collect from our users? </b><br>
ScientificAmerican.com collects personally identifying information from our users during (1) online registration, (2) contest or sweepstakes registration, (3) online surveys, (4) online purchasing, and (5) questions posted to our experts.  Generally, this information includes name, e-mail address, postal address, and answers to survey questions. The information is used for internal marketing purposes and helps us determine how to continually improve our site. We contact only those individuals who specifically request that we do so and those who have won a contest or sweepstakes.
</p><p>
<b>What are cookies and how are they used?</b><br>
Cookies help track a person's "session" while online. They are used on our site to gather basic tracking information and to monitor the presentation of advertisements. They are especially necessary when ordering a product online. Cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information and are not used to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.
</p><p>
In some instances, advertisers will set cookies on our site. These cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information that we have collected but are for monitoring and tracking ad impressions.
</p><p>
Many browsers are set to accept cookies. You may prefer to set your browser to refuse cookies. It is possible, however, that some areas of the site will not function properly if you do so. This is especially likely when trying to order a product online.
</p><p>
Our servers collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our site. 

</p><p>
<b>Are All Privacy Policies the same?</b><br>
ScientificAmerican.com includes links to other web sites whose Privacy Policies we do not control. Once you leave ScientificAmerican.com, use of any information you provide is governed by the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the Privacy Policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information.

</p><p>
<b>Privacy Policy Disclosure</b><br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site. &nbsp;These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_new">click here</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Our Pledge:</b><br>
We will never sell, exchange, or release your personal information (name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card data, etc.) without your consent, regardless of its source, to any third parties.   When we do give information to our advertisers, it is in the form of grouped statistics compiled from registration data and participants' answers to survey questions. None of the data provided is personally identifiable. Information gathered through the use of cookies is not related to any personally identifiable details. 
</p><p>
All information gathered on ScientificAmerican.com is securely stored within a controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a question you post to the Ask the Experts area is available to anyone with Internet access.
