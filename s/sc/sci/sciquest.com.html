On certain pages, for example, you may choose to provide SciQuest with your name, e-mail address, telephone number or other information, to request details about SciQuest, including information about SciQuest's applications and services and investor information. This information enables SciQuest to follow up with you after your visit. If you have voluntarily provided this information, you have consented to the collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<a name="pp2"></a><h3>2. Use and Disclosure of Personal Information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top" style="font-size:.5em; font-weight:normal;"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i> Return to Top</a></h3>

<p>SciQuest does not sell personal information collected through its websites. SciQuest may not share any personal information with third parties unless: (i) authorized by a customer in writing, (ii) with service providers authorized by SciQuest to perform services for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, and only when confidentiality agreements are in place or (iii) compelled to do so by a governmental authority, regulatory body, or under subpoena or similar governmental request or to establish or defend a legal claim.</p>

<a name="pp3"></a><h3>3. Use of Website(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top" style="font-size:.5em; font-weight:normal;"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i> Return to Top</a></h3>

<p>SciQuest, or SciQuest-authorized service providers, may observe your activities, preferences, and transactional data relating to your use of our website(s) and our services. While SciQuest may collect or log this information, SciQuest does not identify you or match this information with your other personal information (such as your IP address) unless you have chosen to identify yourself by completing a contact form on the website. SciQuest may use this collected or logged information to diagnose website technical problems.

<a name="pp4"></a><h3>4. Cookies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top" style="font-size:.5em; font-weight:normal;"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i> Return to Top</a></h3>

<p>SciQuest uses technology that many other websites employ, including, without limitation, "cookies" or small data files stored on your computer's hard drive, to collect information. Cookies are small text files that our websites ask to place on your computer's hard drive. If your browser is set to accept cookies, then your browser adds the text in a small file. SciQuest does not use cookies to read any other information on your computer's hard drive. SciQuest uses cookie technology to authenticate your access to various areas of our websites, and tailor its content to your preferences. Cookies help us analyze web traffic in general and to track when site visitors complete surveys. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to warn you before a cookie is placed.</p>

<p>SciQuest also uses web beacons, or transparent GIF files, provided by our service provider to report activity on our site. The beacons help us manage our online advertising and measure its effectiveness. These files enable our service provider to recognize a cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements are most effective. Either SciQuest or our services providers place the cookie. The information that SciQuest collects by means of these technologies is anonymous and is not personally identifiable unless you have chosen to identify yourself through a form on the website.</p>

<a name="pp5"></a><h3>5. Retargeted Advertising&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top" style="font-size:.5em; font-weight:normal;"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i> Return to Top</a></h3>

<p>Retargeted advertising uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is used to display more relevant information to you on the SciQuest website. This information is also used to display SciQuest employment opportunities to you if you have visited our careers page. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from SciQuest or through third party website publishers.</p>

<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent cookies or to notify you each time a cookie is set. To opt out of receiving marketing related communications from SciQuest, please click on the "opt-out" link in the communication or please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sciquest.com">privacy@sciquest.com</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of receiving generic ads.</p>

<p>Our websites include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

<a name="pp7"></a><h3>7. Opt-Out; Access&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top" style="font-size:.5em; font-weight:normal;"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i> Return to Top</a></h3>
