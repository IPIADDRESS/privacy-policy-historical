                  </p>
                  <p>
                      When you visit our website, we automatically collect
                      information about the website that referred you to us, your
                      IP address, browser type, language and access times
                      (<strong>Technical Data</strong>).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      We also collect navigational information related to the pages
                      visited on our website including viewed pages, clicked links
                      and other actions taken in connection with the site
                      (<strong>Usage Data</strong>).

                  <p>
                      When you create an account with us we also keep your username
                      and password as well as the history of your orders and other
                      details of products or services you have acquired from us
                      (<strong>Profile Data</strong>) and your payment card details

                      but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly
                      reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the
                      percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect
                      aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you,
                      we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.

              data (as described above) to our distributors based in the EU (Group
              1) or the countries in Group 2, which are deemed by the European

              In relation to the United States, this country offers its
              businesses to be certified under the Privacy Shield certification
              system which, again, is deemed adequate to ensure safety of your
              data and enforceability of your rights.
          </p>
          <p>
              The countries in Group 3 do not, as yet, offer a similar degree
              of protection as our laws do, however transfers of personal data
              to those countries is sporadic and undertaken only when necessary
              for our legitimate interests.  In addition to protect your data
              and your rights, we have adopted the following safeguards:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</li>

                We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
                fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes
                of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
                consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data,
                the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
                your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal

                and the applicable legal requirements.

          <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.</p>

              <dd>to your personal data (commonly known as a <q>data subject access request</q>).
                  This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about
                  you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
              </dd>
            </div>

              <dt>Request correction</dt>
              <dd>of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to

              to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

              This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data
              where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
              You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your
              personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to
              object to processing (see below), where we may have processed
              your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase
              your personal data to comply with local law.  Note, however, that
              we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure
              for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if
              applicable, at the time of your request.

              your particular situation which makes you want to object to
              processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
              fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to
              object where we are processing your personal data for direct
              marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we
              have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information
              which overrides your rights and freedoms.

                  structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that
                  this right only applies to automated information which you

If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

          <h3>No fee usually required</h3>
          <p>
              You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise
              any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your
              request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with
              your request in these circumstances.
          </p>
          <h3>What we may need from you</h3>
          <p>
              We may need to request specific information from you to help us
              confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your
              personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is
              a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed
              to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact
              you to ask for further information in relation to your request to
              speed up our response.
          </p>
          <h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
          <p>
              We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
              Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request
              is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In
              this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
