<p><strong>1. The Information Scribd Collects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User-provided Information</strong>: You may provide to Scribd what is generally called “personally identifiable” information (such as your name, email address, postal mailing address, home/mobile telephone number) if you log in to the Scribd Platform, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Scribd Platform.&nbsp; You may also provide other information to Scribd, including your age, location, and gender, through use of its functionality and features, such as by creating a user profile.</li>
<li><strong>“Cookies” Information:</strong> When you access the Scribd Platform, we or one of our advertising partners, may send one or more cookies – small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Scribd may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Scribd Platform. One type of persistent cookie that may be installed on your computer when you use Scribd is called a “Flash cookie” or an “LSO.” Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser's “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. For more information on how to manage Flash cookies, you can go here. For more information about cookies and how they are used, you can go here.</li>
<li><strong>“Automatically Collected” Information</strong>: When you access the Scribd Platform or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique device or user ID, version of software installed, system type, the referring search query used to locate content and pages on the Scribd Platform, the content and pages that you access on the Scribd Platform, the dates and times that you visit the Scribd Platform, and information from your Facebook account that you make publicly available, which is provided to us by Facebook via the Facebook APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. The Way Scribd Uses Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scribd uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Scribd Platform as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</li>
<li>Scribd may also use the information that you provide or that we collect to serve you with advertisements.</li>
<li>We will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or policy issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to, read on, or downloaded from Scribd. You also consent to receive other communications from Scribd, such as newsletters about new releases, special offers, promotional announcements, and customer surveys via email or other methods. If you no longer wish to receive certain non-transactional communications, you may opt-out via the “<a href="https://www.scribd.com/account-settings/preferences" target="_blank">Account Settings &gt; Preferences</a>” panel after you have logged into the Scribd website. </li>
<li>Scribd uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Scribd Platform works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.</li>
<li>Scribd may use “Automatically Collected” information and “Cookies” information to: (a) automatically update the Scribd application on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Scribd Platform; (c) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; (d) provide such metrics to Users as they pertain to such User’s uploaded content; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="disclose"></a>3. When Scribd Discloses Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scribd does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent, except that if you have provided us with an email address, Scribd may provide a hashed version of it to its advertising partners, RapLeaf, Bizo, and LiveRamp, to enable better targeted advertising where RapLeaf, Bizo, and LiveRamp already possesses your email address.&nbsp; If RapLeaf, Bizo, or LiveRamp do not already have your email address in their records, they cannot use the hashed version that we provide.&nbsp; For more information on RapLeaf’s privacy practices, and to opt out, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rapleaf.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.rapleaf.com/privacy</a>. &nbsp;For more information on Bizo's privacy practices, and to opt out, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bizo.com/businessProfessionals/index" target="_blank">http://www.bizo.com/businessProfessionals/index</a>.&nbsp;For more information on LiveRamp's privacy practices, and to opt out, please visit <a href="http://liveramp.com/privacy" target="_blank">http://liveramp.com/privacy</a>/.</li>

<li>Scribd shows aggregate geographical information about visitors on Scribd document pages in our analytics section. This information includes the cities and countries of people viewing documents, the document which was viewed, and the time the document was viewed. This information is publicly available to all Scribd users.</li>
</ul>
