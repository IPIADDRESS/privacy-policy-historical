    <p>
        <strong>This Privacy Policy applies to all personally identifiable information obtained
            from or about the registered users (end user data), and related to or arising from
            the use of the ScreenshotMonitor.com</strong> We respect your right to privacy
        and we have provided you this Privacy Policy to inform you how your personal information
        will be collected, tracked, stored, used, and protected, and to give you choices
        as to what personal information you wish to share with us.
    </p>
    <h3>Free user notice</h3>
    <p>
        We provide the same standard of handling the personal information to free and commercial
        users. However, please note that as a free user some parts of this privacy policy
        may not apply to you. This privacy policy applies to free users only to the extent,
        to which they provide ScreenshotMonitor.com with personal information.
    </p>
    <h3>What Information Does ScreenshotMonitor.com Collect and Track?</h3>
    <h4>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h4>

        The following information may be collected and stored automatically: the IP address
    from which you access the internet, the date and time, the internet address of the
    website from which you link directly to our website, the name of the file or the
    words you search, and the browser you use to access our website. This information
    is used to measure the number of visitors to various sections of our website and
    to identify system performance or for server issues. We also use this information
    to help us expand the coverage of the website and to make the website more useful.
    This information is not correlated with any personal information and we never disclose
    it in a form that personally identifies you.
    </p>
    <h4>Personal Information Provided by Users</h4>
    <p>
        We request personal information when you create a user account, place an order,
        register a product, request a service, correspond with us, or engage in certain
        other activities on our website, such as answering a survey or entering a contest.
        "Personal information" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable
        individual. An individual is considered identified or identifiable if it is possible
        to identify him or her directly or indirectly. We only request personal information
        which is necessary for us to provide a product or service that you require and we
        only process the personal information for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.
        For example: If you submit an order on-line with us, we ask you for information
        necessary to complete the transaction, such as your name, address, and credit card
        number. If you request technical support on-line, we ask you for information necessary
        to complete the transaction, such as your name address and information about your
        computer hardware, software (including your License Number), and the nature of the
        problem you are experiencing. If you wish to create a user account, we ask you for
        information necessary to keep you informed about ScreenshotMonitor.com products
        and services with regard to your needs, such as your e-mail address. If you wish

        queries and to provide support, such as your name, surname, e-mail address, and
        country. You decide whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal
        information. However, if you do not wish to provide information needed for a transaction,
        you may not be able to complete it.
    </p>
    <h3>How Do We Use the Information We Collect and Track?</h3>

        We use personal information in the following ways and for the following limited
        purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide you with information about product upgrades, new products, services,
            research on future product ideas or improvements, to send newsletters, informative
            e-mails or other information which has the nature of business announcements. ScreenshotMonitor.com
            reserves the right to use customers' contact information to send them information
            it deems important for the full utilization of its products and services. Every
            registered customer may choose not to receive such information from ScreenshotMonitor.com
            by simply replying to any message to that effect (with the exception of messages
            which are necessary for the functionality of our products and services);</li>
        <li>To assist us in creating content that is relevant to you;</li>
        <li>To assist us in creating better, customized products and services to meet your needs;</li>
        <li>To allow you to purchase and download products, obtain access to services or otherwise
            engage in activities you select;</li>
        <li>To help you quickly find software, services, or product information important to
            you;</li>
        <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you chose
            to do so; and</li>
        <li>To notify you about changes to our service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        ScreenshotMonitor.com, including our offices (subsidiaries and affiliates) abroad
        to which your personal data is made accessible, retain the personal information
        collected through ScreenshotMonitor.com website, including your personal information
        that you submit through a registration process, for as long as you are registered
        at any ScreenshotMonitor.com website through a user account or are a user of ScreenshotMonitor.com
        products, and for a reasonable time thereafter, unless and until you have recalled
        your consent with the processing of your personal information.
    </p>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>
        We restrict access to personal information about you to those ScreenshotMonitor.com
        employees who need to know the information for the purposes described in this Privacy
        Policy. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables
        you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this
        password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. If you
        share a computer with anyone, always log out before leaving a website or service
        to protect access to your information from subsequent users. Unfortunately, no transmission
        of information over the internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Although
        we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the
        security of any information you transmit to our website from your computer or the
        Internet Service Provider, and any transmission is at your own risk.
    </p>
    <h3>With Whom Do We Share Your Information?</h3>
    <p>
        Except as described in this Privacy Policy, <strong>we will not disclose</strong>
        users’ personal information outside of ScreenshotMonitor.com and its controlled
        subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. ScreenshotMonitor.com will expend
        the maximum effort to protect users' personal information against misuse and will
        refrain from disclosing it to third parties. Through some ScreenshotMonitor.com
        websites, by selecting a region (language) option, you may be asked to share your
        personal information, such as your e-mail contact, with selected local ScreenshotMonitor.com
        partners, such as distributors (the full list of which is available at our local
        websites) so that they can contact you, on our behalf, about ScreenshotMonitor.com
        products, services or offers that we believe are important to you or your business
        and to provide you a local technical and customer support. We encourage you to read
        our partners' privacy policies before providing your personal information. ScreenshotMonitor.com
        retains the services of outside contractors to provide limited services on our behalf,
         such as shipping products or handling order processing, processing transactions
        (including credit card transactions), or performing statistical analysis of our
        services. It may be necessary to share user personal information with these contractors
        in order to allow them to provide their services. You have the right not to provide
        the requested information, but in such case you may not be able to receive these
        services. Those contractors will be permitted to obtain only the personal information
        they need to deliver the service and we require that they keep the personal information
        of our customers secure and confidential and comply with the Act. We also require
        that these contractors use our customers' personal information only on behalf of
        ScreenshotMonitor.com and do not disclose them to third parties or use them for
        any other purpose. Please be advised that in certain instances it may be necessary
        for ScreenshotMonitor.com to disclose your personal information if we believe such
        action is necessary to: <strong>(a)</strong> comply with law or legal process served
        on ScreenshotMonitor.com; <strong>(b)</strong> protect and defend the rights, property
        or legitimate interests of ScreenshotMonitor.com (including the enforcement of our
        agreements); or <strong>(c)</strong> act in urgent circumstances to protect the
        personal safety of users of ScreenshotMonitor.com services or members of the public.
