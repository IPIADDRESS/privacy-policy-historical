					<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
					<h3>Logging of anonymous usage data</h3>
					<p>When you access any part of our website, we will inevitably learn certain information about you.

					<p>We collect this information for internal use only, and will never share, sell or otherwise expose any part of these log files without your explicit consent. One exception is that we may, at times, employ a third party to gather the same information about our visitors and in return provide us with comprehensive statistics.</p>
					<p>At this time, we use Google Analytics to analyze the use of this website. Please review their <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/nl/analytics/privacyoverview.html">privacy policy</a> as well.</p>
