         <p>
            TechSmith Corporation ("TechSmith") uses client-side cookies to capture information about page visits and
            to maintain application awareness and "state". This information is anonymous and we use this information only
            internally to deliver the most effective content to our visitors. Screencast.com uses information from the cookies
            to gauge page popularity, analyze traffic patterns on our site and guide development of other improvements to our
            site. TechSmith does not require you to accept cookies; however, some functionality on this Site and the related
            service may be disabled if you decline to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive
            a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. You may also change your cookie settings in

         <h3>Volunteered Information and How We Use It</h3>
         <p>
            When you sign up for an account, we collect personal information from you including your e-mail address. The
            information allows us to process your subscription and activate your account which may include verifying
            authorization of credit card usage before any purchase of the Screencast.com service.
         </p>
         <p>
            Screencast.com is a service that fosters visual communication through a variety of means. Content owners may wish
            to establish a direct line of communication with viewers who post comments about their media. As a means to that
            end, we ask that a viewer submit their e-mail address when posting comments, which we would then include in an e-mail
            notification message that the content owner has an option to receive. At no time is the poster's email address visible
            to the public. At no time do we ever share the poster's email address with anyone other than the content owner.
         </p>
         <p>
            When you purchase something on our site, we collect personal information from you including your credit card information
            and the e-mail address that corresponds to your Screencast.com account, and to which we will send an order confirmation.
            We collect this information on web pages using encryption technology to help prevent any third party from intercepting
            the information. We only use your credit card information for completing the purchase transaction and our billing
            provider saves your credit card information for recurring billing purposes. We may use the information provided by our
            customers to analyze product trends based on, for example, geographic and demographic factors. This analysis helps us
            improve the quality of our website.
         </p>
         <p>
            When you contact us via e-mail, we may use your return e-mail address to respond when necessary or when requested to do so.
         </p>
         <p>
            We may use the information we collect to notify you occasionally about important functionality changes to our website, new
            Screencast.com services, and special offers we believe you will find valuable. If you would rather not receive this
            information, you may opt-out at any time. We send every promotion with explicit opt-out instructions. From time to time,
            we may randomly contact customers about participating in a survey about our products, services and/or website. Your
            feedback helps us identify customer needs, levels of satisfaction, and improve and/or develop new products and services
            for you and your family. These surveys are always voluntary and you may opt-out at any time.
         </p>
         
         <h3>Information Collected in Contests</h3>
         <p>
            If you enter one of our contests, we will handle the data we collect according to the rules of that particular contest and
            those rules may differ based on where you live. We provide a privacy policy specific to each contest that you should
            review prior to entering the contest but in general you must be 13 years or older to participate in our contests.
         </p>
         
         <h3>INFORMATION SHARING</h3>
         <p>
            TechSmith does not use your personal information for purposes incompatible with those listed above. TechSmith does not sell
            or rent personal information to a third party. TechSmith will provide your e-mail address as indicated above to a content
            owner, credit card clearing service or security service but only upon your voluntary consent to provide such information
            to such third parties.
         </p>
         <p>

         <h3>We Are Committed To Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</h3>
         <p>
            At Screencast.com, the safety of your children is very important to us. Consequently, TechSmith does not collect, knowingly or
            intentionally, information from children under 13 without prior verifiable parental or guardian consent. If you are under 13 and wish
            to purchase items from TechSmith or wish to provide personal information to TechSmith in connection with this service, you must
            obtain your parent's or guardian's consent before you register for this service or provide TechSmith with any information. TechSmith
            must rely on parent(s) or guardian(s) to decide which materials are appropriate for children under 13 to view and children under 13
            cannot change registration information, only the parent or guardian can do that. Parents or guardians should follow the procedure that
            they used to enable their child's registration to review, change or delete any registration information at any time. Parents or
            guardians, you can always ask us to review or delete any of your child's information and you can refuse to permit further collection
            or use of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request using the contact information set forth at the
            beginning of this policy.
         </p>
         
         <h3>Updates to this Policy</h3>
         <p>
            As our website evolves over time or our data handling policies change, we will update this privacy policy. Changes made to this policy
            will be effective ten days following the posting of the new policy on the website. If we make significant changes to our data handling
            practices, we will make efforts to notify our active customers in other reasonable ways that may include an administrative email or
            other notice. This privacy policy will be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan to the extent U.S. federal law is not applicable.
         </p>
         
         <h3>NON-U.S. CUSTOMER INFORMATION</h3>
         <p>
            If you are logging on from outside the United States, the personal information you submit to TechSmith will be sent to and stored in

         <h3>SPECIAL NOTE TO CHILDREN</h3>
         <p>
            If you are under 13 years old, ask your parent or guardian BEFORE giving out any information about yourself, such as your name, age,
            address or e-mail address. You do not have to give any personal information about yourself. Remember, if you are under 13 you must
            have your parent or guardian make any changes to information given to TechSmith in the past or to update your profile. If you are ever
            unsure about anything you are seeing on this Site or a TechSmith product or service, ask your parent or guardian for help.
         </p>
         
         <h3>SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S OF CHILDREN UNDER 13</h3>
         <p>
            TechSmith may collect the name of a child, parent, or guardian and online contact information in order to obtain parental or guardian
            consent from parents or guardians of Children under 13 and/or to provide parental or guardian notice by providing a link to this
            privacy policy wherever TechSmith has requested personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a visitor indicates
            that he/she is under the age of 13, he/she will be asked to supply a parent's or guardian's e-mail address. In this case, the parent
            or guardian will receive an e-mail message containing instructions on how to enable the child's registration and until the parent or
            guardian enables the child's registration, the account is disabled. If TechSmith does not receive the parent's or guardian's consent
            within a reasonable time, TechSmith will delete this information from its records. If and when TechSmith has obtained verifiable consent
            from a parent or guardian, TechSmith will only ask for and collect from a Child under 13 personally identifiable information that is
            reasonably necessary for that Child to participate in any given activity online and/or use certain TechSmith's Screencast.com services.
            TechSmith may also collect this information to respond to a specific request from a Child under 13. Once TechSmith responds to a request
            from a Child under 13, TechSmith may not contact that child again and the information is deleted from our records. TechSmith takes very
            seriously the safety of children, especially those under 13 and TechSmith may also collect this information to protect that safety. If
            TechSmith collects information to protect the safety of your child, TechSmith will provide notice to you and TechSmith will not use that
            information for any other purpose. You can always ask TechSmith to review or delete any of your child's information as indicated above
            and you can refuse to permit further collection or use of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request at the
            contact information set forth at the beginning of this policy. If, however, you ask us to delete your child's information that is
            necessary to participate in TechSmith activities or use its Screencast.com services, TechSmith may have to ask your child not to
            participate in such TechSmith activities or use or benefit from TechSmith Screencast.com services.
         </p>
         
         <h3>ENFORCEMENT</h3>
         <p>
            TechSmith regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy
            or TechSmith's treatment of personal information by contacting us using the contact information set forth at the beginning of this policy.
            When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is TechSmith's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her
            concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any
            complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between TechSmith and an individual.
         </p>
         
         <h3>NO ERROR FREE PERFORMANCE</h3>
         <p>
            We customarily release alpha and beta versions of our products and services, which are further refined before the release of the final
            version. Because these products or services are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our
            efforts to do so. As such, we welcome feedback on any privacy concerns you may have, and on how to improve our products or services
            generally, in all stages of release. TechSmith does not guarantee error-free performance under this Privacy Policy. We will use reasonable
            efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our privacy
            policy. TechSmith shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this Privacy Policy.
         </p>
         <p>
