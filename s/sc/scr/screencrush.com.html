Cookies also hold information to personalize and enhance your experience and to gather Website(s) statistical data, such as which pages are visited, the Internet provider's domain name and the addresses of the sites you visited immediately before coming to and immediately after leaving the Website(s).  The information in the cookies lets us trace your âclickstreamâ activity (i.e., the paths taken by users of the Website(s) as they move from page to page) to enable us to better serve you by revealing which portions of the Website(s) are the most popular. We may also allow our affiliate and service providers and advertisers to serve cookies from the Website(s) to allow them to assist us in various activities such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of the Website(s), its content and advertising.  Some third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offer a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org).  </p>

<p>5.3	We may also use âpixel tagsâ (sometimes called âweb beaconsâ or âclear gifsâ), which are tiny graphic images, on the Website(s). Pixel tags help us analyze usersâ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of the Website(s) and our advertising and marketing.

We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information.  </p>

<p>5.4	Cookies, pixel tags, and/or other analytical tools that we may use on the Website(s) may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Website(s).  This information may include your computer's Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the website(s) you visited immediately before coming to the Website(s).

We may also work with businesses that use tracking technologies to deliver advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to the Website(s) and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. </p>

<p>5.5	We may combine the NPII collected through cookies, pixel tags and other analytical tools with other information we may have collected from you. This information may be used to improve the Website(s), to personalize your online experience, to help us deliver information to you, to determine the effectiveness of advertising, and for other internal business purposes.  We may use and share aggregated and anonymous information to conduct market research and analysis for ourselves and/or for our business partners. Given the anonymous, non-personally identifiable nature of such information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on how we may use or disclose such information. For example, we may freely share such information with third parties who may use such data for their own marketing, advertising, research, or other business purposes. We may also freely share such information with our service providers in order for them to perform services to or for us.  </p>

These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows us or our partners to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Townsquare and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<p>We do not want you to send to us any confidential or proprietary information through email or otherwise. Any information, materials, suggestions, ideas or comments sent to us will be considered non-confidential, and by submitting the same to us, you are giving us the absolute right to use, modify, reproduce, transmit, display and distribute the information for any purpose whatsoever, with no payment or other compensation to you. However, we will not use your name unless we are required by law to identify the source of the materials, information, suggestions, ideas or comments, or unless we first obtain your permission. </p>

<h3 id="retention">13.	Retention, Access and Deletion</h3>

<p>We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you products or services; as needed for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection; as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements; or to the extent permitted by law.  At the end of the retention period, we will delete your Personal information in a manner designated to ensure that it cannot be reconstructed or read.</p>

<p>We currently work with Oracle, which maintains a consumer tool called the BlueKai Registry, which allows you to remove individual interest segments at your sole discretion.  Such information is from the profile associated with the specific browser, computer or device that you are visiting it with, and unless Oracle has linked browsers, computers or devices into a common profile as described in the Oracle Marketing Cloud &amp; Oracle Data Cloud Privacy Policy (link above), you may see different segments when viewing the registry from a different browser, computer or device.  </p>

<h3 id="assignment">14.	Assignment</h3>

<p>We may freely assign this Privacy Policy or any of our rights and/or obligations hereunder. </p>
<h3 id="international">15.	International User Notice</h3>
<p>For international users, please note that it may be necessary to transfer your information internationally and, in particular, your information may be transferred to and processed in the United States. For residents of the European Union -- the data protection and other laws of other countries outside of the European Union may not be as comprehensive as those of the European Union. Please be assured that we take steps to ensure that your privacy is protected as described in this Privacy Policy, including Section 8.5. By using the Website(s), you agree to have your information used and transferred to the United States as set forth in this policy. </p>
<h3 id="disputes">16.	Disputes</h3>
<p>Any disputes regarding this Privacy Policy are subject to the Terms of Service on the Website(s) that you access and will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, applicable to agreements made and performed in New York.  You agree that any and all disputes and causes of action arising out of this Privacy Policy shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration under the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (âJAMSâ) and held at the JAMS regional office in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, New York.  This obligation applies regardless of whether the claim or dispute involves a tort, fraud, breach of contract, misrepresentation, product liability, negligence, violation of a statute, or any other legal theory. Included are all claims that may arise after the termination of this Privacy Policy and claims related to direct marketing efforts, including complaints concerning unsolicited text messages, emails, and telemarketing calls. We agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative proceeding. All arbitrations shall be conducted on an individual and not on a class-wide basis, and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that this agreement specifically prohibits you from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person. This provision concerns a transaction in interstate commerce, and therefore shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Â§ 1 et seq.</p>
<p>The remedy for any claim shall be limited to actual damages, and in no event shall any party be entitled to recover punitive, exemplary, consequential, or incidental damages, including attorneyâs fees or other such related costs of bringing a claim or seek injunctive relief or any other equitable claim.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  For New Jersey residents, the previous two sentences apply only to the maximum extent permitted under New Jersey law.</p>
