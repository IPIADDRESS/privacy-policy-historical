<p>1.1	We value our users and respect your privacy.  This Privacy Policy describes the Personal Information (as defined below) we collect about you online, why we collect it, how we use it, and when we share it with third parties. This Privacy Policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use certain of that information.</p>
<p>1.2	The Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by us offline or through any other means, including any third party or any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Websites. </p>
<p>1.3.

<h3 id="info">2.	Information Collected  </h3>
<p>	2.1	We collect information that you provide directly to us.  You may provide different types of Personal Information to us when you engage in certain Website(s) activities, such as creating an account, ordering a product or service, submitting, posting or accessing various content or features, subscribing to mobile push notifications, responding to and submitting a form, participating in our blogs or forums, entering a sweepstakes, contest, promotion or other special initiative, signing up for a special offer, completing a survey, sending feedback, requesting or submitting information, applying for a job, or directly contacting us.  It is optional for you to engage in such activity, however, if you choose to do so, we may require that you provide us certain Personal Information.  Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is required and some is voluntary.  If you do not provide required information for a particular activity, you may not be permitted to engage in that activity. We also ask that you not send us, and that you not share, any sensitive Personal Information, for example, social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background and/or trade union membership.</p>
<p>2.2	We may also collect certain information automatically, we may collect data that is not linked but may be linkable to an individual or to a particular device (such as “hashed” email addresses or usernames so as to be non-identifiable, and demographic information such as gender, age or income when not tied to PII), and location data that describes the precise geographic location of a device.  This information may be collected through various technologies, including through use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies, and may include the following:  your browser and mobile phone, tablet or other device type, operating system and name of your Internet service provider; web pages you visit on the Website(s); IP address, browser type, profile information, geo-location information; information about your interactions with email messages, such as whether the messages were opened and the links clicked in those emails; and standard server log information. 	</p>

Using your email and password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete, or change information. The Personal Information provided by you is not used for any purpose other than as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you ever use a public computer to access the Website(s) account, we strongly encourage you to log out at the conclusion of your session.

Registered users’ user names are displayed to all users, although each verified user has the option of having his or her full name displayed to all users instead of his or her user name.  We therefore encourage you to choose a user name that is not your actual name. We take steps to protect against our revealing email addresses, physical addresses or cell phone numbers directly to other users or disclosing such information to third parties other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  </p>
<p>2.6	Payment processing information is not collected by us.  We currently use a third party for payment processing.

<p>4.6	In addition, if we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a financing, investment, support or funding, sharing or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets shared or transferred.  If we engage in any of these types of transactions, your information will be subject to our Privacy Policy in effect at the time of the transfer or sharing of such information.  </p>
<p>4.7 	The Website(s) may allow users to post comments and other content to the Website(s). Any Personal Information that you post to the Website(s) will become public information and will be accessible by other users of the Website(s).

The information in the cookies lets us trace your “clickstream” activity (i.e., the paths taken by users of the Website(s) as they move from page to page) to enable us to better serve you by revealing which portions of the Website(s) are the most popular. We may also allow our affiliate and service providers and advertisers to serve cookies from the Website(s) to allow them to assist us in various activities such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of the Website(s), its content and advertising.  Some third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offer a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org).  </p>
<p>5.3	We may also use “pixel tags” (sometimes called “web beacons” or “clear gifs”), which are tiny graphic images, on the Website(s). Pixel tags help us analyze users’ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of the Website(s) and our advertising and marketing. We may also use other analytical tools to evaluate site performance through the use of aggregated data, which contain no Personal Information. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information.  </p>
<p>5.4	Cookies, pixel tags, and/or other analytical tools that we may use on the Website(s) may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Website(s).  This information may include your computer’s Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the website(s) you visited immediately before coming to the Website(s). Cookies, pixel tags, and/or other analytical tools in our emails may also be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us.  We may also work with businesses that use tracking technologies to deliver advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to the Website(s) and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. </p>
<p>5.5	We may combine the NPII collected through cookies, pixel tags and other analytical tools with other information we may have collected from you. This information may be used to improve the Website(s), to personalize your online experience, to help us deliver information to you, to determine the effectiveness of advertising, and for other internal business purposes.  We may use and share aggregated and anonymous information to conduct market research and analysis for ourselves and/or for our business partners. Given the anonymous, non-personally identifiable nature of such information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on how we may use or disclose such information. For example, we may freely share such information with third parties who may use such data for their own marketing, advertising, research, or other business purposes. We may also freely share such information with our service providers in order for them to perform services to or for us.  </p>
<p>5.6	Ads appearing on the Website(s) may be delivered to users by Townsquare or one of our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows us or our partners to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Townsquare and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p>5.7	We authorize certain service providers to utilize NPII for their business purposes and in accordance with their privacy policies, such as to report on usage or industry trends to their customer base. </p>

<h3 id="security">6.	Your Security </h3>
<p>6.1	We strive to keep your Personal Information private and safe.

<p>Any disputes regarding this Privacy Policy are subject to the Terms of Service on the Website(s) that you access and will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, applicable to agreements made and performed in New York.  You agree that any and all disputes and causes of action arising out of this Privacy Policy shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration under the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) and held at the JAMS regional office in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, New York.  This obligation applies regardless of whether the claim or dispute involves a tort, fraud, breach of contract, misrepresentation, product liability, negligence, violation of a statute, or any other legal theory. Included are all claims that may arise after the termination of this Privacy Policy and claims related to direct marketing efforts, including complaints concerning unsolicited text messages, emails, and telemarketing calls. We agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative proceeding. All arbitrations shall be conducted on an individual and not on a class-wide basis, and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that this agreement specifically prohibits you from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person. This provision concerns a transaction in interstate commerce, and therefore shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.</p>
<p>The remedy for any claim shall be limited to actual damages, and in no event shall any party be entitled to recover punitive, exemplary, consequential, or incidental damages, including attorney’s fees or other such related costs of bringing a claim or seek injunctive relief or any other equitable claim.

We may also allow our affiliate and service providers and advertisers to serve cookies from the Website(s) to allow them to assist us in various activities such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of the Website(s), its content and advertising.

We may also work with businesses that use tracking technologies to deliver advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to the Website(s) and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. </p>\n<p>5.5\tWe may combine the NPII collected through cookies, pixel tags and other analytical tools with other information we may have collected from you.

We may use and share aggregated and anonymous information to conduct market research and analysis for ourselves and/or for our business partners.

You agree that any and all disputes and causes of action arising out of this Privacy Policy shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration under the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&#x201C;JAMS&#x201D;) and held at the JAMS regional office in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, New York.  This obligation applies regardless of whether the claim or dispute involves a tort, fraud, breach of contract, misrepresentation, product liability, negligence, violation of a statute, or any other legal theory. Included are all claims that may arise after the termination of this Privacy Policy and claims related to direct marketing efforts, including complaints concerning unsolicited text messages, emails, and telemarketing calls. We agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative proceeding. All arbitrations shall be conducted on an individual and not on a class-wide basis, and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that this agreement specifically prohibits you from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person. This provision concerns a transaction in interstate commerce, and therefore shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &#xA7; 1 et seq.</p>\n<p>The remedy for any claim shall be limited to actual damages, and in no event shall any party be entitled to recover punitive, exemplary, consequential, or incidental damages, including attorney&#x2019;s fees or other such related costs of bringing a claim or seek injunctive relief or any other equitable claim.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  For New Jersey residents, the previous two sentences apply only to the maximum extent permitted under New Jersey law.</p>\n<h3 id=\"contact\">17.\tContact</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions about your privacy or security at the Website(s), or wish to update your Personal Information, please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:privacy@townsquaremedia.com\">privacy@townsquaremedia.com</a> or write to us at:  Townsquare Media, Inc., ATTN:  Privacy, 240 Greenwich Ave., Greenwich, CT 06830, Fax: 1 (800) 301-6408, and include your name, mailing address and email address in the message.
