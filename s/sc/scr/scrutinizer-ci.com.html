            <strong>Log Data.</strong>
            When you use our Service, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you
            visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or
            the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, and the search terms you use.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong>
            Like many websites, we also use “cookie” technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve
            the Site and our Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk.
            A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when
            you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be
            used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your
            web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. Scrutinizer may use both
            session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service,
            to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our
            Service.
            <br><br>
            We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology,
            including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address
            or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just
            before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on
            the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these
            technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened,
            clicked on, or forwarded a message, to the extent permitted under applicable law.
            <br><br>
            You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before
            accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept,
            cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest
            potential.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Do Not Track.</strong>
            Scrutinizer does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions
            that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who use our Service.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons.</strong>
            We may display third-party content on the Service. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or
            other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the
            Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons, such as the support button, that may function
            as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web
            beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Scrutinizer. Please consult such
            third party’s data collection, use, and disclosure policies for more information.

            <strong>Links to Other Websites.</strong>
            Our Site contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement,
            authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over
