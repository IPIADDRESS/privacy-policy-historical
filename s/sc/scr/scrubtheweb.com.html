<b>Scrub The Web Privacy Policy</b><br><br>

In general, Scrub The Web does not collect, store, use or disclose personally identifying 
information except in very specific instances, such as, for example, when you enroll as 
a member or advertiser/merchant, as defined below. The instances in which Scrub The Web does collect and use 
information are specifically described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

Scrub The Web provides fun, easy to use services, including Scrub The Web Search (located at 
www.scrubtheweb.com) and Scrub The Web Web site development services (located at www.scrubtheweb/abs/) 
(the "Services"). The Services are made available by Scrub The Web and, its subsidiaries and affiliates. 
Scrub The Web values its users and their concerns about privacy. To this end, Scrub The Web engages 
in consistent information practices and uses its best efforts to make clear disclosures regarding 
those practices. This Privacy Policy is a part of that effort.<br><br> 


<b>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</b><br><br>

This Privacy Policy applies to collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by 
Scrub The Web. If there are any exceptions, we will clearly disclose them prior to collecting any 
information, and will give you an opportunity to choose not to participate or provide the 
information.<br><br>

Please be aware that, as part of the Services, Scrub The Web provides links to Web sites operated 
by third parties, and also provides search results and similar services to third parties for 
display on their own Web sites or applications. Scrub The Web is not responsible for the information 
collection or privacy practices or the content of those third party Web sites or applications. Also, 
please be aware that banner ads on Scrub The Web may be provided by a third party, which may collect 
cookies as part of the process of serving those ads. These cookies are typically used for the 
purpose of tracking performance of the banner ads. Scrub The Web does not determine which information 
will be collected by that third party. Please see the paragraph below regarding Third Party Banner Ads.<br><br>

<b>Third Party Banner Ads.</b><br><br>

Scrub The Web may use other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web 
site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or 
telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements 
on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.<br><br>

<b>What information does Scrub The Web collect and how is it used?</b><br><br>
Does Scrub The Web disclose information to third parties? Scrub The Web may collect any or all of 
the following three types of information: (a) traffic or clickstream data, (b) cookies, or (c) 
contact information and other personally identifying information. Scrub The Web's collection and use 
of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be 
shared with third parties.<br><br>

<b>(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data.</b> Data about traffic and usage is not personally 
identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying 
or identifiable information. Scrub The Web may share information it collects with certain selected 
third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. For example, we may tell an  advertiser that 
a certain number of people visited a certain area on our Web site or searched Web sites for the term 
"apple pies."Scrub The Web collects some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser 
functions and the files (pages) users access. For example, Scrub The Web's servers collect information 
about the site from which you entered to enable Scrub The Web to calculate and pay its affiliates if 
any, information about the most frequently searched terms to help its advertisers provide the most 
relevant search results, information about usage to check for fraudulent behavior or other 
abnormalities and to ensure that our Services are technically superior. In addition to the foregoing 
applications, Scrub The Web uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design the Services.<br><br>


<b>(b) Cookies. Like many sites, Scrub The Web may collect information about online behavior using 
cookies.</b> These cookies contain identification information that enables us to see how our users are 
interacting with our site and how frequently they are returning, as well as to streamline their 
experiences using the Services. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. 
Cookies lets us know about repeat visitors and if we are delivering quality products and services. 
Scrub The Web may also use cookies to identify which sites our repeat visitors are coming from, so 
that we can place more of our online advertising on these sites, and can, where necessary, pay our 
affiliates and other business partners. To Scrub The Web, using information within cookies is an 
anonymous way to survey how we are doing and to look for ways to improve our Services. You may set 
your browser software to reject cookies, but you may not be able to use all of the features of the 
Services. Scrub The Web may share information about usage of the Services with third parties, but 
only in aggregated, anonymous form. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our 
third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.<br><br>

<b>(c) Contact Information or Personally Identifying Information.</b> Scrub The Web can obtain access to 
your name, e-mail address and other contact information only (1) when you become an member 
advertiser or merchant with Scrub The Web, provide comments, submit a problem, or request 
information from Scrub The Web and provide your name or return contact information, (2) when you 
register for the advanced features of Scrub The Web, or (3) in connection with special offers or 
contests.<br><br>

Contact information provided in connection with problems, comments or requests is used only to 
respond to those problems, comments or requests. This information is not stored or used in 
connection with traffic or clickstream data and is provided to a third party only as necessary 
to respond to the comment, problem or request.<br><br>

Scrub The Web may use registration information to make users aware of new products or special offers 
or promotions. Scrub The Web will abide by requests from you (in accordance with the procedure below) 
to discontinue such use. Scrub The Web stores personally identifiable information obtained through 
registration securely (as described below) and considers it part of the assets of its business. 
With your permission, Scrub The Web will not provide registration information to third parties.<br><br>

Finally, you may choose to provide contact information, other personally identifying information, 
and demographic information in order to participate in optional surveys or contests, which are run 
for promotional purposes. Scrub The Web uses such information to send you information about its 
products and to notify you if you win the contest. Finally, from time to time, but only with your 
permission, Scrub The Web may provide certain of its users' registration information to selected 
third parties who wish to participate in special promotions offered in conjunction with Scrub The 
Web. Users may opt-out of receiving such communications at any time by contacting Scrub The Web.<br><br>

<b>Is data stored by Scrub The Web secure?</b><br><br>

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of 
information, Scrub The Web has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to 
safeguard and secure the information it collects online. However, data security is a constantly 
evolving art and science. You should consider any communication that you transmit to Scrub The Web 
(such as data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and agree that 
Scrub The Web will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to you is intercepted 
and used by an unintended recipient.<br><br>

<b>Does Scrub The Web collect personally identifying information from or about children?</b><br><br>

Scrub The Web uses reasonable efforts not to collect, use or disclose individually identifiable 
information from children under the age of 13. The Services are not targeted at children, and 
children may not register for any portions of the Services that require registration.<br><br>

<b>How can I access or correct any personally identifying information about me?</b><br><br>

To request a copy of the personally identifiable information you have sent to Scrub The Web, 
please send an email containing your request to support@scrubtheweb.com. You must provide 
your full name and the e-mail from which the request is received (and to which the response 
will be sent) must match the e-mail on file with Scrub The Web. You may then correct or delete 
such information using the procedures specified in the e-mail.<br><br>

<b>How do I find out more about Scrub The Web's information practices?</b><br><br>
