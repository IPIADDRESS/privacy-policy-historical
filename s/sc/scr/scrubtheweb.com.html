      <h1>ScrubTheWeb™ Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>In general, Scrub The Web does not collect, store, use or disclose personally identifying information. The instances in which Scrub The Web does collect and use information are specifically described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>Scrub The Web provides easy to use services, including Web search and SEO services (the "Services"). The Services are made available by Scrub The Web. Scrub The Web values its users and their concerns about privacy. To this end, Scrub The Web engages in consistent information practices and uses its best efforts to make clear disclosures regarding those practices. This Privacy Policy is a part of that effort.</p>
      <h3>What this Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Scrub The Web. If there are any exceptions, we will clearly disclose them prior to collecting any information, and will give you an opportunity to choose not to participate or provide the information.</p>
      <p>Please be aware that, as part of the Services, Scrub The Web provides links to Websites operated by third-parties, and also provides search results and similar services to third-parties for display on their own Websites or applications. Scrub The Web is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of those third-party Websites or applications.</p>
      <h3>Do Not Track</h3>
      <p>First and foremost Scrub The Web respects the privacy of our users and we do <strong>NOT</strong> collect click-stream data or share any user information with anyone except in extreme cases of payment fraud or under specific court order. At Scrub The Web your privacy means "<strong>the right to be let alone</strong>". Unfortunately not all businesses feel the same way and because of this the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) felt they needed to get involved. In fact, on December 1, 2010 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a document titled "<img src="/graphics/spawn.gif" class="spawn_window" alt="Open Window Icon"><a href="http://ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf" title="Open Window to Visit" onclick="javascript:window.open('http://ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf'); return false;">Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change</a>" (often referred to as "<strong>Do Not Track</strong>"). This document discusses online consumer privacy and what steps Websites should take to protect consumers.</p>
      <p>Many consumers are not aware of the information that is collected and how that information is often used. Below is an excerpt from the FTC document we felt would be of interest to our users to help you better understand how your privacy may be compromised by these malicious businesses and advertisers:</p>
      <blockquote style="font-style:italic;" cite="http://ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf">
        <p>Consumers live in a world where information about their purchasing behavior, online browsing habits, and other online and offline activity is collected, analyzed, combined, used, and shared, often instantaneously and invisibly. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>if you browse for products and services online, advertisers might collect and share information about your activities, including your searches, the websites you visit, and the content you view;</li>
          <li>if you participate in a social networking site, third-party applications are likely to have access to the information you or your friends post on the site;</li>
          <li>if you use location-enabled smartphone applications, multiple entities might have access to your precise whereabouts;</li>
          <li>if you use loyalty cards at a grocery store or send in a product warranty card, your name, address, and information about your purchase may be shared with data brokers and combined with other data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some consumers are troubled by the collection and sharing of their information. Others have no idea that any of this information collection and sharing is taking place. Still others may be aware of this collection and use of their personal information but view it as a worthwhile trade-off for innovative products and services, convenience, and personalization. And some consumers — some teens for example — may be aware of the sharing that takes place, but may not appreciate the risks it poses.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>You may notice here at Scrub The Web our pages do not contain third-party advertisers and we do not have or hide third-party code on any of our Web pages. Why? Because your privacy is important to us and it is these methods that jeopardise your privacy.</p>
      <h3>Third-Party Advertisements</h3>
      <p>Scrub The Web does <strong>NOT</strong> use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our Website.</p>
      <h3>Third-Party Statistics Collection</h3>
      <p>Scrub The Web does <strong>NOT</strong> use third-party companies to collect data of any kind. This includes services like Google Analytics or any other off-site tracking service.</p>
      <h3>What information does Scrub The Web collect and how is it used?</h3>
      <p>Scrub The Web may collect any or all of the following three types of information: (a) traffic or clickstream data, (b) cookies, or (c) contact information and other personally identifying information. Scrub The Web's collection and use of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with third-parties.</p>
      <p style="padding-left:18px;"><strong>(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data.</strong> Data about traffic and usage is not personally identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. Scrub The Web does <strong>NOT</strong> share this information with any third-party.</p>
      <p style="padding-left:18px;"><strong>(b) Cookies. Like many sites, Scrub The Web may use cookies.</strong> These cookies enable us to help users log in to the Member's area of our site or to help them enter form data in services such as Easy Submit. You may set your browser software to reject cookies, but you may not be able to use all of the features of the Services. Scrub The Web does <strong>NOT</strong> share cookie information with any third-party.</p>
      <p style="padding-left:18px;"><strong>(c) Contact Information or Personally Identifying Information.</strong> Scrub The Web can obtain access to your name, e-mail address, URL and other contact information only (1) when you become a Member, advertiser or merchant with Scrub The Web, provide comments, submit a Web page for inclusion in our index, submit a problem or provide feedback, or request information from Scrub The Web and provide your name or return contact information, (2) when you register for the advanced features of Scrub The Web, or (3) in connection with special offers or contests.</p>
      <p>Contact information provided in connection with problems, questions, comments or requests is used only to respond to those problems, questions, comments or requests. This information is <strong>NOT</strong> stored or used in connection with traffic or clickstream data and is <strong>NOT</strong> provided to third-parties and only used to respond to the comment, problem or request.</p>
      <p>Scrub The Web may use registration information to make users aware of new products or special offers or promotions. Scrub The Web will abide by requests from you (in accordance with the procedure below) to discontinue such contact. Scrub The Web stores personally identifiable information obtained through registration securely (as described below) and considers it part of the assets of its business. Scrub The Web does <strong>NOT</strong> provide registration information to third-parties except in the event a user is abusing our system or we are required to share this information by court order.</p>
      <p>Finally, you may choose to provide contact information, other personally identifying information, and demographic information in order to participate in optional surveys or contests, which are run for promotional purposes. Scrub The Web uses such information to send you information about its products and to notify you if you win the contest. Scrub The Web does <strong>NOT</strong> share this information with any third-party. Users may opt-out of receiving such communications at any time by contacting Scrub The Web.</p>
      <h3>Is data stored by Scrub The Web secure?</h3>
      <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, Scrub The Web has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects online. However, data security is a constantly evolving art and science. You should consider any communication that you transmit to Scrub The Web (such as data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and agree that Scrub The Web will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient.</p>
      <h3>How can I access or correct any personally identifying information about me?</h3>
      <p>To request a copy of the personally identifiable information you have sent to Scrub The Web, please contact us by clicking on the "<strong>Contact Us</strong>" link found on virtually all pages throughout our site. You must provide your full name and the email from which the request is received (and to which the response will be sent) must match the name and email on file with Scrub The Web. You may then correct or delete such information using the procedures specified in the email.</p>
      <h3>How do I find out more about Scrub The Web's information practices?</h3>
