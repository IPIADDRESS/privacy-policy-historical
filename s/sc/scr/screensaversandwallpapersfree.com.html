					      <p>Agents and contractors of ScreensaversandWallpapersFree.com who

					      <p><strong>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</strong></p>
					      <p>ScreensaversandWallpapersFree.com contains links to other sites
					        whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors
					        should consult the other sites' privacy policies, as we have no

					        that are not our own.</p>
					      <p>From time to time ScreensaversandWallpapersFree.com may offer contests,
					        sweepstakes, promotions or deals that are sponsored by or co-sponsored
					        with identified third parties. By virtue of their sponsorship, these

					        has no control over third-party sponsors' use of this information.</p>
					      <p>ScreensaversandWallpapersFree.com will provide notice if third-party
					        sponsors will so obtain such information. ScreensaversandWallpapersFree.com
					        may use reputable third parties to present or serve the advertisements
					        that you may see at our web pages and to conduct research about
					        the advertisements. Our privacy policy does not cover any use of
					        information by such third parties or the methods by which third-parties
					        collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs).</p>
					      <p><strong>Third-party Ad Serving</strong></p>
					      <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you
					        visit our site. These companies may use information (not including

					        visit to ScreensaversandWallpapersFree.com in order to provide advertisements
					        about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the
					        course of serving advertisements to the ScreensaversandWallpapersFree.com
					        website, our third-party advertising companies may place or recognize
					        a unique "cookie" on your browser.</p>
					      <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
					      <p>To enhance your experience with our sites, many of our web pages
					        use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your
					        computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves,
					        do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable
					        information unless you choose to provide this information to us
					        by, for example, registering at one of our websites. However, once
					        you choose to furnish ScreensaversandWallpapersFree.com with personally
					        identifiable information, this information may be linked to the
					        data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage
					        and to improve the content and offerings at ScreensaversandWallpapersFree.com.
					        For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at
					        our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to
					        our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable
					        you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies
					        to offer you products, programs, or services. Small pieces of code
					        called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" may be
					        used to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such
					        as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses.
					        These "web beacons" may be used to deliver cookies that
					        conform to our cookie policy.</p>
					      <p><strong>Our Commitment to Security</strong></p>
					      <p>We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
					        procedures to safeguard and prevent unauthorized access, to maintain
					        data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.</p>
					      <p><strong>Special Note for Parents</strong></p>
					      <p>In an effort to be compliant with the Children's Online Protection
					        Privacy Act (COPPA) it is our policy to collect no personally identifiable
					        information from children. Therefore, all individuals are required
