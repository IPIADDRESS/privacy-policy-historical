    <p>We at Screenleap know that you care about how your personal data is used and shared, and we take
        your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. <b>By visiting
        or using our various websites (collectively, the "Website"), API ("API"), or services (collectively, the "Services"),
        you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent
        that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</b></p>

    <h2>I. What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
    <p>This policy outlines our handling practices and how we collect and use the Personal Data you provide during your
        online and offline interactions with us. As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Data" means any information
        that can be used to individually identify a person and may include, but is not limited to, name, email address,
        physical address, credit card number, title, and other personally identifiable information.</p>

    <p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that
        we do not employ or manage. This policy also does not apply to information you choose to disclose publicly on the
        Website (i.e., information which is viewable to other Website users), which will not be considered Personal Data.</p>

    <p>If you reside in the European Union ("EU"), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, Iceland, or Switzerland, you may
        have additional rights with respect to your Personal Data, as further outlined below. These rights may include
        rights under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR").</p>

    <p>Screenleap will be the controller of your Personal Data that is provided, collected, and/or processed pursuant to
        this Privacy Policy, except where otherwise expressly stated below. If you have any questions about whether any
        of the foregoing applies to you, please contact us using the information set forth in the "Questions or Concerns"
        section below.</p>

        Services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Account registration</li>

        <li>Generating reports based on information collected from use of our Website or Services</li>
        <li>Requesting service and support for our Services and providing such support</li>

    <br>

    <p>We collect the following categories of Personal Data about you when you use or otherwise interact with our
        Website and Services:</p>
    <p><b>A. Personal Data You Provide to Us</b></p>
    <p>We receive and store any information you provide to us. The types of Personal Data collected may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Telephone number</li>
        <li>Postal or other physical address</li>
        <li>Credit/debit card information</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of
        certain features, options, customizations, and offers if they require Personal Data that you have not provided.</p>
    <p><b>B. Personal Data Collected Automatically</b></p>
    <p>Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from
        your browser. The information collected includes your IP address, "cookie" information, browser information, operating system
        information, and the page you requested.</p>
    <p><b>Geolocation</b> - We collect information about where you are located when using our Services. We use this
        information for purposes such as optimizing your connection to our data center and suggesting customizations
        to your experience with our Services (e.g., your language preference).</p>
    <p><b>Cookies</b> - Cookies are identifiers we transfer to your computer through your browser that allow us to recognize your
        browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited. We use cookies to analyze trends, administer the
        Website, track users' movements around the Website, and gather information about our user base. You may be able to
        change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer's acceptance of cookies, but this may
        prevent you from taking advantage of our Website's features.</p>
    <p><b>Usage Information</b> - When you use some of our Services, network information is transmitted back to us such as Service usage
        information. This information is transmitted back to us so we can determine how users are interacting with our
        Services, to assist us with improving our Services, and to correct any problem that may occur.</p>
    <p>When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site), we only use this
        data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate
        data tells us how often users use parts of the Website, so that we can make the Website appealing to as many
        users as possible.</p>
    <p><b>C. Email Communications</b></p>
    <p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more
        interesting and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate
        your preference by opting out of our email notification services.</p>

    <p><b>D. Recordings</b></p>
    <p>If you use a feature of the Service that allows for Recordings (defined below), we collect information from you
        that you provide in connection with such use and through such Recordings, to the extent you provide it to us.
        This information may include Personal Data, if you provide us with Personal Data.</p>
    <p><b>For Presenters</b> - By installing or using the Screenleap Service or any other software, tool, or feature
        that allows for recording (each, a "Recording"), you acknowledge and agree that you and your company are
        responsible for (i) clearly notifying all individuals (whether or not they are Screenleap users) who are
        present in a screen share session (whether in-person or remotely) (each, a "Viewer") for which you make a
        Recording that such a screen share session might be recorded, and (ii) obtaining any consent necessary for such
        a recording as required by applicable laws, rules and regulations, including without limitation data privacy
        laws. By making a Recording of any screen share session using any Screenleap Services, you and your company
        represent and warrant that (a) you have received legally sufficient consent from all Viewers for such a
        Recording prior to starting a Recording, (b) you will only make, use, store, and otherwise process such a
        Recording in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including data protection laws and (c) you
        will store and otherwise restrict access to such Recordings using appropriate technical and organizational
        safeguards. <b>Any person and/or entity who makes a Recording of a screen share session shall be the data
        controller of that Recording, and Screenleap will be the data processor with respect to the Recording.</b></p>
    <p><b>For Viewers</b> - Please be advised that for any screen share session that you attend, Recordings can be
        enabled by a presenter. By signing up for Screenleap's Services or otherwise using them in any way, including
        without limitation by attending any Screenleap screen share session, you expressly acknowledge that Screenleap
        may, if instructed by a presenter, make and store Recordings for Screenleap screen share sessions, and make
        such Recordings available to presenters and other viewers at the direction of the presenter. If you do not
        want to be recorded, you can choose to leave the screen share session.</p>

    <p>While we endeavor to protect the privacy of your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized
        entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of your Personal Data

    <p>The Website may contain links to other third-party sites and services which are outside our control and not
        covered by this policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) sites you

    <p>Our Services are hosted and operated in the United States ("U.S.") through Screenleap and its service providers.
        We may transfer your Personal Data to the U.S., to any Screenleap affiliate worldwide, or to third parties

        Personal Data, whether provided by you or obtained by a third party, to the U.S. as set forth herein, including
        the hosting of such Personal Data on U.S. servers.</p>

    <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets,
        any user information owned or controlled by us may be one of the assets transferred to third parties. Any successor
        entity will abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy with respect to personal information collected while this
        Privacy Policy was in effect. However, any information you submit or that is collected after this type of
        transfer may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.</p>

    <h2>VIII. What Personal Data Can I Access?</h2>

        to continue using the solution. Users who do not respond or who respond in the negative will have their students' Personal
        Data be deleted.</p>
    <p>Following deletion of your account, we will retain your data for a commercially reasonable amount of time to allow for
        backup, archival, and audit purposes. We may maintain anonymized or aggregated data, including usage data, for analytics purposes.</p>

    <h2>X. What Choices Do I Have?</h2>
    <p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to take
        advantage of some of our features, options, customizations, and offers.</p>
    <p>You can always add or update information as explained in the "What Personal Data Can I Access?" section above. We
        may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Data after you update or delete it, but not
        in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>
    <p>If you do not wish to receive email or other mail from us, you can unsubscribe by updating your email preferences,
