    <p>We at Screenleap know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take
        your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.  <strong>By visiting
        or using our various websites (collectively, the "Website"), API ("API"), or services (collectively, the "Services"),
        acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby
        consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</strong></p>

    <h2>I. What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we
        gather when you are accessing or using our Website.  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies
        that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.  This policy also does not
        apply to information you choose to disclose publicly on the Website (i.e., information which is viewable to other
        Website users), which will not be considered Personal Information.</p>
    <h2>II. What Personal Information Does Screenleap Collect?</h2>

    <p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services and to allow our
        users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Website.
        We collect the following types of information from our customers:</p>
    <p><strong>A. Personal Information You Provide to Us:</strong></p>
    <p>We receive and store any information you provide to us.  The types of Personal Information collected may include
        your name, phone number, email address, credit card information, IP address, and browser
        information.  You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take
        advantage of many of our special features.  We use the Personal Information you provide to enhance your Website
        experience.</p>
    <p><strong>B. Personal Information Collected Automatically:</strong></p>
    <p>Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and records information on our server logs from
        your browser including your IP address, "cookie" information, and the page you requested.</p>
    <p>"Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your computer through your browser that allow us to recognize your
        browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people.  You may be able to
        change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer's acceptance of cookies, but this may
        prevent you from taking advantage of our Website's best features.  Our advertising partners may also transmit
        cookies to your computer, when you click on ads that appear on our site.  This Privacy Policy does not cover
        the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
    <p>When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site), we only use this
        data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  For example, this aggregate
        data tells us how often customers use parts of the Website, so that we can make the Website appealing to as many
        customers as possible.  We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners, so that they can
        understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, can provide you with an
        optimal online experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify
        you personally.</p>
    <p><strong>C. E-mail Communications:</strong></p>
    <p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more
        interesting and improve our service.  If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate
        your preference by opting out of our email notification services.</p>

    <h2>III. Will Screenleap Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</h2>
    <p>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone.  We share your Personal Information in personally
        identifiable form only as described below.</p>
    <p><strong>A. Advertisers:</strong> We allow advertisers to choose the demographic information of users who will see
        their advertisements and you agree that we may use any of the information we have collected from you in
        non-personally identifiable form to allow our advertisers to select the appropriate audience for those
        advertisements. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads for San
        Francisco businesses, but we will not willingly or knowingly tell such businesses who you are or provide them
        with any of your personally identifying information.</p>
    <p><strong>B. Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</strong> In certain situations, businesses  we're affiliated
        with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us).  You can
        recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction, and we will share your Personal
        Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction.</p>
    <p><strong>C. Agents:</strong> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share
        your information with them to provide products or services to you.  Unless we tell you differently, our agents
        do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>
    <p><strong>D. User Submissions:</strong> You may submit comments to the blog appearing on the Website.  Any content
        (including without limitation images, captions, and comments) you voluntarily disclose for other users to view
        on the Website is not Personal Information; it becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others,
        and may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels.</p>
    <p><strong>E. Communication About the Website: </strong>As part of the Website and Services, you may receive
        communications from us, whether by email or other means.  We and our agents may send you email, contact you, or
        engage you in other communication that we or they determine relate to your use of the Website.</p>
    <p><strong>F. Promotional Offers:</strong> We may send offers to certain users on behalf of other businesses. However,
        when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address. If you do not wish to receive these offers,
        please opt out of our email communication services.</p>
    <p><strong>G. Business Transfers:</strong> We may choose to buy or sell screenshots.  In these types of transactions,
        customer information is typically one of the business screenshots that is transferred.  Also, if we (or substantially
        all of our screenshots) are acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, Personal Information would be
        one of the screenshots transferred to or acquired by a third party. </p>

    <p><strong>H. Protection of Screenleap and Others:</strong> We may release Personal Information when we believe
        in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other
        agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Screenleap, our employees, our users, or others.
        This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
        reduction.</p>
    <p><strong>I. With Your Consent:</strong> Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal
        Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>

    <h2>IV. Is Personal Information About me Secure?</h2>
    <p>We endeavor to the privacy of your User Profile and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we
        cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors,
        may compromise the security of user information at any time. </p>
    <p>The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on
        other sites. When linking to another site you should read that site's privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>V. What personal information can I access?</h2>
    <p>You can always view or update the information we have on file about you, by contacting us using our <a href="/support">Support</a> page.</p>

    <h2>VI. What Choices Do I Have?</h2>
    <p>You can always opt not to disclose information to use, but keep in mind some information may be needed to take
        advantage of some of our special features.</p>
    <p>You can always add or update information as explained in Section V above.  When you update information, however,
        we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.  We may use any aggregated data derived from
        or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify
        you personally.</p>
    <p>If you do not wish to receive email or other mail from us, please unsubscribe from our email communication services.
        Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal
        notices will still govern your use of the Website, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for
        changes.</p>

    <h2>VII. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy
        Policy in effect at the time such information is used.  If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information,
        we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Website or sending you an email.  You are bound by any changes
        to the Privacy Policy when you use the Website after such changes have been posted.</p>

    <h2>VIII. Questions or Concerns</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message using our
        <a href="/support">Support</a> page.  We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
