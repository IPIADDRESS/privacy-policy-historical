These server logs are used for diagnostic and maintenance purposes, and to produce aggregated statistics which we may use to monitor and improve our services.</div>
</li><li>
<div align="justify">Your web browser may accept a "session cookie" which allows the web server to associate your requests with each other and distinguish them from the requests of other visitors. The "session cookie" is a random string of letters and numbers and contains no personally identifying information.</div>
</li><li>
<div align="justify">Your web browser sends information "request headers" to any site you visit to let the site know what language(s) you prefer to see the site displayed in. You can control this information using the options or preferences settings in your browser software. This information is used only to serve the current request, and for system diagnostics.</div>
</li><li>
<div align="justify">You may choose to view our site in a language other than that set in your browser preferences. If you ask for this choice to be remembered for future visits, we may send your browser a "preference cookie" which your browser will store and may send to our site during future visits. The "preference cookie" contains only simple information, for example "lang=en," which does not personally identify you.</div>
</li><li>
<div align="justify">When you use our site search page, the search terms you requested and the top results displayed may be remembered in order to monitor and improve the accuracy of the search results the search page provides. This information is not used by us for other purposes.</div>
