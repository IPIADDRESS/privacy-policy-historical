<h4 id="goals-of-this-policy">Goals of this policy</h4>

If you sign in using your account on a third-party social network or other website, we additionally retain your unique ID in that website so that we can identify you when you sign in a second time. We do not access any other information or publish anything on external networks using your sign-in credentials.</p>

<p>We also retain your current settings and preferences in order to personalize your experience.</p>

<h5 id="creating-a-room">Creating a room</h5>

<p>If you create a room, we will retain the current settings of the room. Additionally, if you choose to integrate that room with your community’s accounts on other social networks or websites, we will store any account credentials you provide for those platforms as long as you choose.</p>

<h5 id="messages-and-other-content-you-post">Messages and other content you post</h5>

<p>These are retained indefinitely, and their visibility (who can access it) is controlled by the owner of the room to which you post them. Room owners may change this visibility at any time, including making it public.</p>

<h4 id="how-we-use-or-disclose-the-collected-information">How we use or disclose the collected information</h4>

<p>Apart from as described below, we will not disclose your personal data to any third parties.</p>

<h5 id="improving-your-experience">Improving your experience</h5>

<p>All the data you provide may be used to detect and debug technical problems, identify potential improvements, to test enhancements to the service or to prevent abuse and spam. In doing so, we may utilize third-party tools such as Google Analytics. In every such case where a third-party is provided access to your data, we will ensure that these services provide privacy and data security guarantees that match or exceed those in this Policy.</p>

<h5 id="legally-required-disclosures-and-emergencies">Legally required disclosures and emergencies</h5>

<p>If we are legally required to disclose your information to the government, we will do so. If we are able to, we will make reasonable attempts to notify you of this disclosure.</p>

<p>Additionally, we may voluntarily disclose your information to third parties under extraordinary circumstances such as to prevent imminent and serious physical harm to a person; to address ongoing fraud, security violations, or spam; or to protect our rights or property.</p>

<h4 id="cookies-and-client-side-storage">Cookies and client-side storage</h4>

<p>As part of the normal functioning of the Scrollback platform, we will store small amounts of data on your computer using “cookies” or “client-side storage”. These may also be stored by third-party tools such as Google Analytics that we use to help improve your experience. These help us identify you when you access Scrollback.</p>

<p>Most browsers include an option to clear and reject cookies and web site data. To discover how to do this, please consult the “help” feature of your web browser.</p>

<h4 id="data-security">Data Security</h4>

<p>Scrollback will make commercially reasonable efforts to secure your information. However, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of this data. You use the service at your own risk, and are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (such as carefully maintaining the secrecy of any passwords or securing your third-party social network accounts).</p>

<h4 id="change-in-control">Change in control</h4>

<p>If a merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control of Askabt Pte. Ltd. happens, you will retain the same rights as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4 id="changes-to-this-policy">Changes to This Policy</h4>

<p>We reserve the right to change this policy for any reason. If we make changes, we will make resonable efforts to notify you.
