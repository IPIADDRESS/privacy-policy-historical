		<p>Scripted ("Scripted" or "We") 
		is very sensitive to the privacy needs of its website visitors and members 
		(collectively, "You" or "User") and recognizes the 
		importance of protecting personally identifiable information that You 
		may choose to share with Scripted.  This Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy 
		Policy") provides You with important information regarding Scripted's 
		collection, storage and use of personally identifiable information.</p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to personally identifiable 
		information collected on the website(s) operated by Scripted on which 
		this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, "Website"), and 
		does not apply to any other information collected by Scripted offline 
		or through any other means.</p>
		<p>Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy 
		are defined in the Scripted Terms of Service.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Registration Information</span></p>
		<p>Scripted never automatically collects any information 
		that specifically identifies Users, such as their name, address, or 
		e-mail address.  Scripted collects personally identifiable information 
		from Users only when Users voluntarily provide it as part of the registration 
		process ("Registration Information") to open an Account. We 
		always ask Users whenever we need Registration Information that identifies 
		Users or allows us to contact Users.</p>
		<p>Scripted may collect and use personally identifiable 
		information from Users for purposes other than to open an Account, e.g., 
		such as subscribing to a newsletter, participating in polls, surveys, 
		and questionnaires, using tell-a-friend features, participating in contests, 
		sweepstakes, or other promotions, or receiving technical support.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Consent and Security</span></p>
		<p>It is Your choice whether or not You provide Your 
		Registration Information to Scripted, but Registration Information is 
		required in order for Scripted to provide You with services - namely, 
		access to and/or participation in Jobs, to post Jobs and receive Writer 
		Services, and certain other features of the Website.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Use of Personally Identifiable Information</span></p>
		<p>Your personally identifiable information may be used 
		internally within Scripted and its subsidiaries, affiliated companies, 
		or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information 
		in conformance with our Privacy Policy.  We require that such other 
		businesses and persons agree to comply with our Privacy Policy.  For 
		example, Scripted may use Your personally identifiable information internally 
		to provide access to You and process Your contributions to projects, 
		to understand who uses the Website, to improve the Website, to provide 
		updates on special events, news, and announcements of interest to our 
		Users, and to contact You for customer service, payment, and billing 
		purposes.</p>
		<p>In addition, Scripted reserves the right to disclose 
		Your personally identifiable information under limited circumstances 
		in the event Scripted believes that the Website is being used to commit 
		unlawful acts; if disclosure of Your personally identifiable information 
		is required to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or with a 
		court or administrative order; or will help to enforce our Terms of 
		Service, to protect Your safety or security) including the safety and 
		security of property that belongs to You) or to protect the safety and 
		security of the Website or third parties.</p>
		<p>From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell 
		one or more of our businesses and Your personally identifiable information 
		may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.  The personally 
		identifiable information transferred as a part of the purchase or sale 
		would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable 
		and permissible to do so.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Usage Information</span></p>
		<p>Non-personally identifying information ("Usage 
		Information") comprises information that does not identify any 
		particular User.  Examples include: information about which of Scripted's 
		pages are visited on an aggregate level, browser type, operating system 
		type, or IP address of a User.</p>
		<p>Scripted may collect other types of non-personally 
		identifying information, <span style="font-style:italic">e.g.</span>, age, date of birth, gender, hobbies, or other demographic 
		information.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Use of Usage Information</span></p>
		<p>Your Usage Information may be disclosed internally 
		within Scripted and to third parties. For example, Scripted may disclose 
		Usage Information in order to better understand which parts of the Website 
		Users are visiting, to improve the content of the Website, and for marketing, 
		advertising, or research purposes.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Cookies and Log Files</span></p>
		<p>The Website may place a text file called a "cookie" 
		in the browser files of Your computer.  Cookies can be used to provide 
		You with tailored information from the Website.  The cookie itself does 
		not contain Registration Information. You can set Your browser to notify 
		You when You receive a cookie, giving You the chance to decide whether 
		or not to accept it. Scripted also records information that Your web 
		browser sends whenever You visit any website, such as Your Internet 
		Protocol address.</p>
		<p>The Website uses a variety of technical methods for 
		tracking purposes, including web beacons.  Web beacons are small pieces 
		of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites.  We also 
		use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on the Website, 
		such as the frequency with which our Users visit various parts of the 
		Website.  These technical methods may involve the transmission of information 
		either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect 
		information on our behalf.  We may collect information from use of these 
		technical methods in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>
		<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable 
		information through the Website, in which case Scripted may not be able 
		to provide certain services or features of the Website to You.</p>
		<p>To protect Your privacy and security, we take reasonable 
		steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify Your identity 
		before granting You access to your profile or making corrections.  You 
		are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of Your unique password 
		and account information at all times.</p>
		<p>If at any time You decide to remove Your personally 
		identifiable information from our database, You may do so by emailing 
		us at <a href="mailto:contact@scripted.com" target="_blank">contact@scripted.com</a> or contacting us via the following mailing 
		address:</p>

		certain services or features of the Website to You.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</span></p>
		<p>Scripted may allow advertising services companies 
		to serve advertisements within the Website.  Advertising may be based 
		on usage, text, demographic, or other information gathered by or on 
		behalf of Scripted. Scripted's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and 
		we cannot control, the activities of advertisers.</p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Website operated 
		by Scripted, and not to any other websites to which we may link.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Our Commitment To Data Security</span></p>
		<p>Scripted uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, 
		and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of Your 
		personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant 
		the security of any information You provide to Scripted and You do so 
		at Your own risk.  Once We receive Your transmission of information, 
		Scripted makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security 
		of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that 
		such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed 
		by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Our Commitment To Children’s' Privacy</span></p>
		<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially 
		important. For that reason, Scripted does not knowingly collect or maintain 
		personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information 
		on the Website from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our 
		website is directed to persons under 13. If You are under 13 years of 
		age, then please do not use or access the Website at any time or in 
		any manner. If Scripted learns that personally identifiable information 
		of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Website without 
		verified parental consent, then Scripted will take appropriate steps 
		to delete this information.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Special Note to International Users</span></p>
		<p>The Website is hosted in the United States and is 
		intended for and directed to Users in the United States. If You are 
		accessing the Website from the European Union, Asia, or any other region 
		with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and 
		disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that 
		through Your continued access and use of Scripted, which are governed 
		by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our Terms of Service, You are 
		transferring Your personally identifiable information to the United 
		States and You consent to that transfer.</p>
