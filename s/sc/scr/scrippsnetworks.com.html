												<!-- Body Text : Start -->
												<p>At Scripps Networks, Inc. (“SNI” or “we”), we are committed to protecting the 
													online privacy of visitors to our websites, including <a href="http://www.scrippsnetworks.com/">
														www.scrippsnetworks.com</a>, <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/">www.HGTV.com</a>
													, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/">www.FoodNetwork.com</a>, <a href="http://www.diynetwork.com/">
														www.DIYNetwork.com</a>, <a href="http://www.fineliving.com/">www.FineLiving.com</a>, 
													and <a href="http://www.gactv.com/">www.GACTV.com</a>. This Privacy Policy 
													(also referred to here as the “Policy”) applies only to the websites and online 
													services provided by SNI. This Policy does not cover any interaction you may 
													have with Scripps Networks, Inc. by telephone, postal mail, or other offline 
													communications. The purpose of this Policy is to inform you about the types of 
													information we gather about you when you visit our websites, how we may use 
													that information, and how we disclose it to third parties.
												</p>
												<p>
													Our websites are not designed for use by children without their parent's 
													supervision. We ask that anyone under the age of thirteen not submit any 
													personal information through our websites. We do not knowingly collect any 
													personal information from children under the age of thirteen, and therefore we 
													do not knowingly distribute such information to third parties.
													<br>
													Our websites may contain links to other websites, including websites directed 
													to children. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of 
													any of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other websites to which 
													we provide links from our websites. You should check the applicable privacy 
													policy of the website sponsor when linking to other websites.
												</p>
												<p><strong class="SH">I. Information That We Collect</strong>
													<br>
													<strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
													At various locations on our websites, such as in registration forms, 
													sweepstakes entries, message boards, online stores, surveys, and polls, we may 
													request that you supply us with "personal information," such as your name, 
													email address, mailing and shipping addresses, home or work telephone number, 
													and/or credit card information. You will always know when we are collecting 
													personal information, because we only collect personal information when you 
													voluntarily submit it to us through our online forms and questionnaires. 
													Although you do not have to provide us with any information to visit our 
													websites, you may not be able to fully utilize all of the services on our 
													websites if you choose not to provide certain information. If you do choose to 
													give us personal information through our websites, we will collect and retain 
													that information.
												</p>
												<p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong><br>
													When you use our websites, we may also collect "non-personal information," 
													which is information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact 
													you, such as demographic information (your age, gender, income, education, 
													profession, zip code, etc.). Non-personal information may also include 
													technical information, such as your IP address, the type of browser you are 
													using, the websites you visit immediately before and immediately after you 
													visit our websites, and other anonymous data involving your use of our 
													websites. Non-personal information may also include information that you 
													provide us through your use of our websites, such as the time zone you select 
													if you use a TV schedule feature, or the terms you enter into the search 
													functions of our websites.</p>
												<p><strong>Online Stores</strong><br>
													We may collect personal information from you when you purchase products from 
													our online stores. For example, we may require you to provide your name, 
													contact information, shipping and billing addresses, and a credit card number 
													before we process your orders. We also collect information about your 
													transactions with us. We may use the information that you provide to 
													communicate with you about products purchased through our online stores, to 
													provide customer support in connection with those products, and to send you 
													information about other products and services which we believe may be of 
													interest to you.
												</p>
												<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
													We use "cookies" to enhance your visits to our websites. A cookie is a small 
													amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on 
													your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not store personal information about 
													you, unless you knowingly provide it. Cookies can store non-personal 
													information, such as what websites, pages, or advertisements your browser has 
													accessed. We use cookies to store information and personalize your experience 
													with our websites. For example, cookies allow our websites to recognize your 
													browser as a previous visitor, and thus save and remember any preferences that 
													may have been set while you were previously browsing our websites. Our cookies 
													can also store your password, personalize pages, and keep track of selections, 
													such as your time zone and episode selections, or items you have placed in a 
													"shopping cart."
													<br>
													You do have control over cookies. Most browsers can be set to notify you when a 
													cookie is being placed on your computer. Most browsers can also be set to 
													refuse to accept cookies, although this may affect your Internet experience. 
													You can also erase cookies that are already on your computer. For more 
													information about working with cookies, you should consult your user manual, 
													FAQ, or "help" function of your specific browser and operating system software.
												</p>
												<p><strong class="SH">II. How We Use the Information We Collect</strong>
													<br>
													<strong>Our Services and Websites</strong><br>
													We use your personal information to provide you any services that you may 
													request or require, to communicate with you, to allow you to make purchases, 
													and to allow you to participate in online contests, surveys and games. We use 
													aggregated non-personal information about our users to understand our website's 
													demographics, such as the percentage of male and female users, the geographic 
													distribution of our users, the age ranges of our users, or a combination of 
													these or other demographics. We use the non-personal information we collect to 
													analyze how our websites are being used, and to improve the content of our 
													websites, online product offerings, and marketing and promotional efforts.
												</p>
												<p><strong>Email Communications</strong><br>
													If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personal 
													information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your 
													questions or comments for future reference. However, aside from our reply to 
													such an email, it is not our standard practice to send you email unless you 
													request a particular service that involves email communications, you otherwise 
													consent to being contacted by email or if such contact is to communicate with 
													you about products purchased through our online stores, to provide customer 
													support in connection with those products, and to send you information about 
													other products and services which we believe may be of interest to you. There 
													may be times when you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an email list 
													or electronic newsletter that will send information about our websites or our 
													advertisers to your email address. However, we will provide you with the option 
													to change your preferences and opt-out of receiving those communications. You 
													may request at any time that we not email you in the future by clicking the 
													"unsubscribe" link which is included at the bottom of any email that you 
													receive from us, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@HGTV.com">privacy@HGTV.com</a>. 
													If you unsubscribe, we will make reasonable efforts to discontinue these email 
													communications as soon as practicable.
												</p>
												<p>
													If you make a purchase through our online stores, we may use the information 
													you provide to send you important announcements and updates regarding our 
													websites or online products. You may also receive periodic mailings regarding 
													new products and services. However, you may opt-out from receiving future 
													mailings by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@HGTV.com">privacy@HGTV.com</a> or:
												</p>
												<p>
													Scripps Networks, Inc.<br>
													Attn: Web Privacy Policy Department<br>
													PO Box 50970<br>
													Knoxville, TN 37950
												</p>
												<p>
													When you provide us with your personal information to make a purchase through 
													our online stores, we use this information to process your online order and 
													credit card number. We also use your address and billing information to bill 
													you and provide associated support.
												</p>
												<p><strong class="SH">III. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</strong>
													<br>
													<strong>Affiliates and Non-Affiliates</strong><br>
													Except as specifically set forth in this Policy, we do not share your personal 
													information with any non-affiliated third party without your permission. We may 
													disclose aggregate information, such as demographic information, and our 
													statistical analyses to third parties, including advertisers or other business 
													partners. This aggregate information does not include your personal 
													information. We may, however, share your personal information with certain 
													websites that control us, are controlled by us, or under common control with us 
													(our "Affiliates"), such as the <a href="http://www.HGTV.com" target="blank">HGTV.com</a>,
													<a href="http://www.FoodNetwork.com" target="blank">FoodNetwork.com</a>, <a href="http://www.DIYNetwork.com" target="blank">
														DIYNetwork.com</a>, <a href="http://www.gactv.com/">GACTV.com</a> and <a href="http://www.FineLiving.com" target="blank">
														FineLiving.com</a> websites, and websites operated by our Affiliates or 
													other businesses of the E. W. Scripps Company, our parent company, so that they 
													and we can offer you products and services that may be of interest to you. 
													Please refer to our Affiliates' privacy policies for details regarding how they 
													handle your personal and non-personal information.
												</p>
												<p><strong>Service Providers</strong><br>
													We sometimes engage unaffiliated businesses to assist us in providing you 
													certain services. For example, we may hire a shipping company to help us 
													deliver our products or services to you. We may also use third parties to 
													process online transactions and credit card payments, provide advertising, 
													marketing and promotional assistance, provide email services, or facilitate our 
													online services (such as message boards, chat rooms, and surveys). In those 
													instances, we may need to share your personal information with them. We require 
													these companies to use your personal information only to provide the particular 
													product or service and do not authorize them to use your personal information 
													for any other reason.
												</p>
												<p>
													We sometimes offer promotions (like sweepstakes or free subscriptions) in 
													conjunction with a third party sponsor. If you choose to participate in one of 
													those promotions, we may share your information with the sponsor if they need 
													it to send you a product or other special promotion they offer.
												</p>
												<p><strong>Business Transactions</strong><br>
													As SNI and its websites continue to develop, we may buy, sell or combine with 
													other businesses. If so, personal and non-personal information that we or other 
													businesses have collected will likely be transferred as part of the 
													transaction. If we sell a business, we will attempt to ensure that requests 
													made of us regarding email communications will be honored.
												</p>
												<p><strong>Public Forums</strong><br>
													We feature public forums such as chat rooms, message boards, bulletin boards, 
													or similar activities where you and other users of our websites can communicate 
													with one another. This Policy does not protect you when you use these public 
													forums or provide information (including personal information) about yourself. 
													Any information you share in a public forum such as a chat room, message board, 
													or bulletin board is public information and may be seen or collected by anyone, 
													including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; SNI is 
													not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you 
													choose to publicly post or share through our websites.
												</p>
												<p><strong>Third Party Advertisers</strong><br>
													We use third-party advertising companies to deliver specific advertisements to 
													you, which appear on pages throughout our websites. These companies collect 
													non-personal information about your visits to our websites and other websites 
													in order to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of 
													interest to you. These companies may also aggregate your non-personal 
													information for use in targeted advertising, marketing research, and other 
													similar purposes. These companies may place their own cookies on your computer. 
													If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from collecting and using this 
													information, you may visit each third party advertiser's website directly and 
													opt-out. You may also visit Network Associates at <a href="http://www.nai.com" target="blank">
														www.nai.com</a> for solutions regarding consumer privacy.
												</p>
												<p><strong>Other Disclosures</strong><br>
													We may disclose personal information when we are required or requested to do so 
													by law, court order or other government or law enforcement authority or 
													regulatory agency; to enforce or apply our rights and agreements; or when we 
													believe in good faith that disclosing this information is necessary or 
													advisable, including, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety 
													of SNI, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other 
													companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We 
													reserve the right to use or disclose non-personal information in any way we see 
													fit.
												</p>
												<p><strong class="SH">IV. Security of the Information We Collect</strong>
													<br>
													The security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain 
													physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to help secure your personal 
													information. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and 
													there is always some risk in transmitting information electronically. The 
													personal information we collect is stored within databases that we control. As 
													we deem appropriate, we use security measures consistent with industry 
													standards, such as firewalls and encryption technology, to help protect your 
													information. However, since no security system is impenetrable, we cannot 
													guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information 
													you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the 
													Internet. Of course, any information you post to any message board, discussion 
													group, or other public posting area on our websites is available to anyone with 
													Internet access.
												</p>
												<p><strong class="SH">V. Accuracy of the Information We Collect</strong>
													<br>
													Any questions you may have regarding our Privacy Policy, the accuracy of your 
													personal information or the use of your personal information, or any requests 
													that we correct, update, or remove your information in our databases, should be 
													directed via email to <a href="mailto:privacy@HGTV.com">privacy@HGTV.com</a>, 
													or via telephone to 865-694-7879. You also can write us at:

													Scripps Networks, Inc.<br>
													Attn: Web Privacy Policy Department<br>
													PO Box 50970<br>
													Knoxville, TN 37950
												</p>
												<p>
													After receiving a request to change your information, we will make reasonable 
													efforts to ensure that all of your personal information stored in databases we 
													actively use to operate our website will be updated, corrected, changed or 
													deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable. However, we reserve 
													the right to retain in our archival files any information we remove from or 
													change in our active website databases. We may retain such information to 
													resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms of use. In 
													addition, it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of 
													the information you have provided to us. A copy of your personal information 
													may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to 
													locate.
												</p>
												<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 17, 2006. We reserve the right to 
													change this Privacy Policy at any time, and will post any changes to this 
													Privacy Policy as soon as they go into effect. Please refer back to this 
													Privacy Policy on a regular basis.</p>
