        PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR PRIVACY POLICY HAS CHANGED EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 20, 2010</p>
    <p>
        Welcome to scrippsnetworks.com. Scrippsnetworks.com is an interactive online service
        operated by Scripps Networks, LLC (“<strong>Scripps Networks</strong>”,
        “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, or “<strong>our</strong>”).&nbsp;
        This “<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>” applies to this site (however
        accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise
        (collectively, “<strong>Computer</strong>”)) and other interactive features,
        applications or downloads that are operated by us that are available through this
        site or that interact with this site and post this Privacy Policy (collectively,
        “<strong>Website</strong>”).&nbsp; Further, this Privacy Policy does
        not apply to our collection of information from other sources (unless specifically
        stated).&nbsp; Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy,
        which includes compliance with California Privacy Rights (see also <a href="http://www.privacyprotection.ca.gov/">
            http://www.privacyprotection.ca.gov</a>).</p>
    <p>
        We have adopted this Privacy Policy to explain what information may be collected
        on our Website, how we use this information and under what circumstances we may
        disclose the information to third parties.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy, together with
        the <strong><u><a href="http://www.scrippsnetworks.com/terms.aspx">Terms of Use</a></u></strong>
        posted on our Website, sets forth the general rules and policies governing your
        use of our Website.&nbsp; Depending on your activities when visiting our Website,
        you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>
    <p>
        We generally keep this Privacy Policy posted on our Website and you should review
        it frequently, as we reserve the right to change it from time to time without prior
        notice to you.&nbsp; Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting
        of the revised Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Scripps Networks will not use your personally
        identifiable information, however, in a manner materially different than what was
        stated at the time it was collected without your consent.&nbsp; WHEN YOU ACCESS
        OUR WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.&nbsp; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS
        PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE, IMMEDIATELY STOP ACCESSING
        OUR WEBSITE.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
    <p>
        Our Website typically collects two (2) kinds of information about you: (a) information
        that you provide that personally identifies you; and (b) information that does not
        personally identify you that we automatically collect when you visit our Website
        or that you provide us.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Personally Identifiable Information:<br>
            <p>
                Our definition of personally identifiable information includes any information that
                may be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name, mail address,
                phone number, etc.&nbsp; As a general policy, we do not automatically collect your
                personally identifiable information when you visit our Website.&nbsp; In certain
                circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise provide you an opportunity to
                submit your personally identifiable information in connection with a feature, program,
                promotion or some other aspect of our Website.&nbsp; For instance, you may:&nbsp;
                (a) provide your name, mail/shipping address, e-mail address, credit card number
                and phone number when registering with our Website, using our online store or in
                connection with a contest entry; (b) provide certain demographic information about
                you (e.g., age, gender, purchase preference, usage frequency, etc.) when participating
                in a survey, poll or joining a club; or (c) post a product rating and recommendation
                on our Website.&nbsp; Certain information may not be personally identifiable when
                standing alone (e.g., your age), but may become so when combined with other information
                (e.g., your age and name).&nbsp; Whether or not you provide this information is
                your choice; however, in many instances this type of information is required to
                participate in the particular activity, realize a benefit we may offer or gain access
                to certain content on our Website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Non-Personal Information:<br>
            <p>
                Our definition of non-personal information is any information that does not personally
                identify you.&nbsp; Non-personal information can include certain personally identifiable
                information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered
                anonymous.&nbsp; We and/or our third party service providers obtain non-personal
                information about you from information that you provide us, either separately or
                together with your personally identifiable information.&nbsp; We and/or our third
                party service providers also automatically collect certain non-personal information
                from you when you access our Website.<br>

        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>B. HOW WE USE &amp; SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Personally Identifiable Information:<br>
            <p>
                The personally identifiable information you submit to us is generally used to carry
                out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve you or in other ways
                naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information.&nbsp;
                We may also use this information to later contact you for a variety of reasons,
                such as customer service, to provide you with information or services or process
                transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive, to provide you with marketing
                or promotional information for our products or those of our parent company, subsidiaries
                or other affiliated companies (“<strong>affiliated companies</strong>”),
                to communicate with you about content or other information you have posted or shared
                with us via our Website or with regard to your use of the Website and, in our discretion,
                changes to the Website and/or Website policies, for internal business purposes,
                or for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise
                set forth in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; You may opt-out from receiving future promotional
                information from us, or direct that we not share your information in the future
                with any affiliated companies or third parties for their direct marketing purposes,
                as set forth below in Section&nbsp;I.<br>
                <br>
                In certain instances we may also share your personally identifiable information
                with our third-party vendors performing functions on our behalf (or on behalf of
                our affiliated companies) – e.g., vendors that process credit card orders,
                deliver our merchandise, administer our promotions, provide us marketing or promotional
                assistance, analyze our data, assist us with customer service, etc.&nbsp; Our vendors
                agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only to carry
                out our requests.&nbsp; In addition, we may share your personally identifiable information
                with participating sponsors to a program or promotion (e.g., a sweepstakes or contest)
                you enter via our Website, and with third parties who assist us in using the content
                or other information you have posted or shared with us via our Website (e.g., production
                companies we may use).&nbsp; Further, we may share your personally identifiable
                information with third parties such as our co-promotional partners and others with
                whom we have marketing or other relationships.&nbsp; Except as provided in this
                Privacy Policy, our <strong><u><a href="http://www.scrippsnetworks.com/terms.aspx">Terms
                    of Use</a></u></strong>, or as set forth when you submit the information, your
                personally identifiable information will not be shared or sold to third parties
                without your consent.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Non-Personal Information:<br>
            <p>
                In addition to any personally identifiable information or other information that
                you choose to provide to us on the Website, we and our third-party service providers
                may use a variety of technologies, now and hereafter devised, that automatically
                collect certain web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the
                Website.&nbsp; This information may include browser type, operating system, the
                page served, the time, the source of the request, the preceding page view, and other
                similar information.&nbsp; We may use this usage information for a variety of purposes,
                including to enhance or otherwise improve the Website.&nbsp; In addition, we may
                also collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular
                device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively, referred to
                herein as a “<strong>Device Identifier</strong>”).&nbsp; A Device Identifier
                is a number that is automatically assigned to your Computer, and we may identify
                your device by its Device Identifier.&nbsp; When analyzed, usage information helps
                us determine how our Website is used, such as what types of visitors arrive at the
                Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find
                most relevant and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content
                and advertising.&nbsp; We may associate your Device Identifier or web site usage
                information with the personally identifiable information you provide, but we will
                treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.<a name="_DV_M63"></a>&nbsp;
                Web site usage information may be collected using various methods, such as the following:</p>

                    Information collected through passive means may be non-identifying or may be associated

                    activities and to improve our services.&nbsp; We may use your non-personal information

                    may share your non-personal information with our affiliated companies and third
                    parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that aggregate information
                    is anonymous information that does not personally identify you.&nbsp; We may provide
                    our analysis and certain non-personal information to third parties (who may in turn
                    use this information to provide advertisements tailored to your interests), but
                    this will not involve disclosing any of your personally identifiable information.</p>

            <br>
            <p>
                If you send someone else a communication from the Website, such as sending Website
                content to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.)
                is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing
                purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.&nbsp;
                Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Website,
                your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>

            <br>
            <p>
                We also may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect with outside
                records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor
                our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services

                any personal identifiable information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed
                by us at the time you provide your personally identifiable information.

        <li>E-mail Communications:<br>
            <p>
                If you send us an e-mail with questions or comments, we may use your personally
                identifiable information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save
                your questions or comments for future reference.&nbsp; For security reasons, we
                do not recommend that you send non-public personally identifiable information, such
                as passwords, social security numbers or bank account information, to us by e-mail.&nbsp;
                Further, we may send you e-mail under the following circumstances: (a) if you request
                a particular service or sign up for a feature that involves e-mail communications;
                (b) if it relates to purchases you have made with us (e.g., product updates, customer
                support, etc.); (c) if we are sending you information about our other products and
                services; (d) if you consented to being contacted by e-mail for a particular purpose;
                (e) if you send us an e-mail, post information on the Website (i.e., a blog) or
                otherwise submit information to us electronically, we may e-mail you to follow-up
                or otherwise communicate with you with respect thereto; (f) to provide you legal
                notices or notices with respect to your use of the Website; or (g) to otherwise
                facilitate a transaction between us.&nbsp; In certain instances, we may provide
                you with tools on the Website that will allow you to set your preferences for receiving
                e-mail communications from us; that is, agree to some communications but not others.&nbsp;
                You may “opt out” of receiving future commercial e-mail communications
                from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link or following the other instructions
                included at the bottom of most e-mails we send, or as provided below in Section
                I; provided, however, we reserve the right to send you transactional e-mails such
                as customer service communications.

        <li>Transfer of Assets:<br>
            <p>
                As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets.&nbsp; If
                another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our assets, the personally
                identifiable information and non-personal information we have about you will be
                transferred to and used by this acquiring entity, though we will take reasonable
                steps to ensure that your preferences are followed.&nbsp; Also, if any bankruptcy
                or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may
                be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Other:<br>
            <p>
                Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose
                any personally identifiable or non-personal information about you if we are required
                to do so by law, with respect to notices and counter-notices pursuant to our DMCA
                notice and takedown policy and procedures and/or if we believe that such action
                is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements
                of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property,
                our Website, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety
                of our Website’s users or the general public.&nbsp;</p>

                We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions through the Website that
                may require registration.&nbsp; By entering any promotion, you are agreeing to the
                official rules that govern that promotion, which may contain specific requirements
                of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the
                promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated
                with the promotion.&nbsp; If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other
                promotion, personally identifiable information may be disclosed to third parties
                or the public in connection with the administration of such promotion, including,
                without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and
                as required by law or permitted by the promotion’s official rules, such as
                on a winners list.</p>

            Residents of the State of California, under certain provisions of the California

        <li>Third Party Ad Server Networks:<br>
            <p>
                The Website may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements
                on the Website and may use traffic measurement services to analyze traffic on the
                Website.&nbsp; Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements
                based on your visits to the Website and other websites you have visited.&nbsp; Third-party
                ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services
                in which you might be interested.&nbsp; The Website’s third party ad network
                providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may
                themselves set and access their own cookies and other technologies on your Computer
                and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your Computer via a
                Device Identifier.&nbsp; These third party cookies and other technologies are set
                to, among other things:&nbsp; (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might
                be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times;
                and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered
                to you.&nbsp; Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by
                third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons,
                which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.&nbsp;
                Third party cookies, web beacons, and other third party technologies are governed
                by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.&nbsp; <strong>While
                    we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Website, you may
                    wish to visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>,
                    which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative
                    (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information
                    used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members.&nbsp;
                </strong>Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members
                will no longer be able to deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which will
                affect this and other web sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any
                targeted content and/or ads.&nbsp; Also, if your browsers are configured to reject
                cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies,
                use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may
                no longer, be effective.&nbsp; Additional information is available on the NAI’s

    <p>
        We may offer chat rooms, message boards, bulletin boards or similar public forums

        personally identifiable information) in connection with your use of these public

        you to identify you with a posting in a public forum.&nbsp; Any information you

        <strong>E. CHILDREN </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The features, programs, promotions and other aspects of our Website requiring personally
        identifiable information are not intended for children.&nbsp; We do not knowingly
        collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen
        (13).&nbsp; If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen
        (13) and believe he or she has disclosed personally identifiable information to
        us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@scrippsnetworks.com" title="blocked::mailto:privacy@scrippsnetworks.com">
            privacy@scrippsnetworks.com</a>.&nbsp; A parent or guardian of a child under
        the age of thirteen (13) may review and request deletion of such child’s personally
        identifiable information as well as prohibit the use thereof.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>F. KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We have implemented security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to
        protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.&nbsp;
        Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable
        information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information
        you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction
        or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.&nbsp; In
        the unfortunate event that your “personally identifiable information”
        (as the term or similar terms are defined by any applicable law requiring notice
        upon a security breach) is compromised, we may notify you by e-mail (at our sole
        and absolute discretion) to the last e-mail address you have provided us in the
        most expedient time reasonable under the circumstances; provided, however, delays
        in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope
        of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the
        legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation.&nbsp;
        From time to time we evaluate new technology for protecting information, and when
        appropriate, we upgrade our information security systems.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>G. OTHER SITES/LINKS</strong></p>
    <p>
        Our Website may link to or contain links to other third party websites that we do

        practices employed by any third party website.&nbsp; We encourage you to note when
        you leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of all third party websites

        is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information
