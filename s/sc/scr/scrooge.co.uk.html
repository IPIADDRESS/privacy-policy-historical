    <p>
      At Scrooge we want you to know about and have control over the data you share with us and how we process them. This text, which we call our <em>Privacy Policy</em>, explains in a concise way what kind of data we collect and how we use them. Its aim is to help you make informed choices regarding the kind of data you share with us.

          Scrooge &amp; Personal Data at a glance
        </h3>
        <p>
          We encourage you to thoroughly read this Policy, however here is a short summary of the key points for your convenience:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <p>
              When you use Scrooge — even for a simple product search — we receive non-identifying information about you, like your IP address or your device type. Furthermore, by choosing to create a Scrooge account you share your e-mail address, your cellphone number and other elements of a public profile — such as a profile picture — with us.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use this information to keep your account secure and to contact you about matters relating to your account.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Scrooge aims at improving your e-commerce experience. When using your account, you can save products you own or just purchased or products you are merely interested in. We use this information, along with your searches, to show you personalized search results and to notify you about outstanding offers you might be interested in.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Scrooge is also a platform for public communications: shop and product reviews and discussions are public and visible to anyone visiting Scrooge, along with the author's username and profile picture.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you post a shop or product review, we may ask you for a proof of purchase — which we will not publish — in order to verify the review.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            You can use your <a href="/account/settings/profile">account settings</a> to choose what data you share with us and to adjust your communication preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can request deletion of your account data at any time by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:dpo@scrooge.co.uk">dpo@scrooge.co.uk</a> from the e-mail address associated with your account.

    <h2 class="title">Data you share with us</h2>

When doing so, we will ask for your e-mail address and a username of your choice. The username will be visible along with your public activity, such as discussions and shop or product reviews. We will use your e-mail to reach out for you and to send notifications. You can adjust your notification options using your <a href="/account/settings/notifications">preferences</a>.
