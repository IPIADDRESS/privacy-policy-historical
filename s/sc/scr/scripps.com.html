                                    <p>We may disclose personal information in special cases when we believe that disclosing information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our site(s), other users of our site(s), anyone else who could be harmed by such activities, or where we are required to do so by court order to applicable law. We reserve the right to disclose personal information when we believe, in good faith, that the law requires it.</p>
