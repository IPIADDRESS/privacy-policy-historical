<div align="center"><strong>Clever Machine Privacy Policy</strong></div>
<div align="center"><strong>Effective as of August 1, 2010</strong></div>
<p></p>
At scenechronize.com, a website operated by Clever Machine, Inc. ("Clever Machine"), we are committed to respecting people’s privacy online. We are also committed to providing you with the very best services we can on our website. In order to do so, we may gather certain personal information about you. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of the scenechronize services. By using scenechronize.com, you consent to the collection and use of your information by Clever Machine as described in this Policy, and you signify your agreement to the Clever Machine Privacy Policy.
<p></p>
<div><strong>What information does Clever Machine collect?</strong></div>
When you visit scenechronize.com, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible.
<p></p>
When you fill in our Contact form or register for the scenechronize service, we collect personal information such as name, email and nature of your project in order to set up your account.  
<p></p>
We may also collect and accumulate anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our website users. For instance, we may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement.
<p></p>
We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to any sponsors.   While an IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.
<p></p>
Upon canceling your scenechronize account, you have the right to request deletion of your account information, subject to our need to keep appropriate archives for our business operations.
<p></p>
We maintain archives of our web logs, databases, and other systems and information. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived after we delete the information from its active database. We maintain archives for disaster recovery, legal and other non-marketing purposes.
<p></p>
<div><strong>What do we do with the information we collect?</strong></div> 
<ol>
<li>It is used to set up and maintain your scenechronize account.  
</li><li>Your phone number may be used in the event that our customer service representatives need to contact you and cannot reach you by email. 
</li><li>Credit card information is used to bill you for services. We use NetBilling for these transactions. They are one of the largest and safest e-commerce billing companies today. 
</li><li>Your personal information will never be sold to any other website owner or merchant. We hate junk mail as much as you. This is why we will only send you email about items that we feel you should know about. This includes special promotional items that Clever Machine endorses, membership changes, terms and conditions changes, Holiday cards, and the latest updates and offerings on scenechronize.com.  When we send you emails that include a link to the scenechronize.com site, that link may contain an alphanumeric identifier that allows us to identify the person to whom we sent the message so that we can personalize our content for that individual.  
</li></ol>
<div><strong>Email Opt-out</strong></div>
Users who no longer wish to receive our email updates or other notifications may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions contained in the applicable email.  
<p></p>
<div><strong>Credit Card Processing</strong></div>
Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party processor that receives credit card numbers and other personally identifying information only to verify credit card accounts and process transactions.  If you feel more comfortable doing so, you are welcome to pay by credit card via fax.  
<p></p>
Credit card security is an important aspect of the online experience. We use encryption technology to keep your credit card information safe.  To ensure that your information is even more secure, once we receive your credit card information, it is stored on a server that isn't accessible from the Internet.   
<p></p>
With whom do we share your information and for what purpose? 
Clever Machine does not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifying information with others. However, when one or more of our business partners co-sponsor a service, we may share with the co-sponsor(s)some or all of the information collected in connection with such service. 
<p></p>
We may also share aggregate user information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to users more targeted advertising, products and services.  
<p></p>
We may contract with third parties to conduct research and marketing on our behalf.  Such third parties will be fully bound by an obligation of confidentiality to Clever Machine and may not use any personally-identifiable information provided by us other than as expressly instructed by us and in strict compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
<p></p>
<div><strong>What information do parties other than Clever Machine collect?</strong></div> 
Some entities that have links on our site may collect personally identifying information about you when you access or utilize those links.  Clever Machine does not control the collection or use of such information, and the practices of those advertisers and websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. 
<p></p>
It is important to note that those entities may not follow the same privacy policies as Clever Machine. For instance, if you click on an advertisement on scenechronize.com, you may be taken away to an entirely different site.  These links can also be from advertisers, content providers and/or partners who may use Clever MachineÕs logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding agreement yet they may still not follow the same privacy policies as Clever Machine.
<p></p>
<div><strong>What are "cookies" and "web beacons" and how do we use them?</strong></div>
Our site may use "cookies" and "web beacons" to speed navigation, keep track of items, and provide you with custom-tailored services.  A "web beacon" is an embedded image file that specifically helps us track whether you have viewed a specific piece of content. We also use "cookies" to remember information you gave us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the site. Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may also use their own "cookies".  
<p></p>
Most browsers are initially set to accept "cookies". If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse "cookies". You will not be able to use our service if you turn off the "cookies" option.
<p></p>
<div><strong>Security</strong></div>
scenechronize.com member accounts are secured by member-created passwords.  In addition, we use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our databases, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff.  
<p></p>
We use Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) for secure transmissions. SSL applies encryption between two communicating applications, such as your PC and the server. Your name, other personal information, and all credit cards and other payment information that you transmit to us will be protected by 128-bit encryption technology, provided your browser is properly configured and your computer is operating properly. The SSL technology requires that you have a reasonably current browser that is capable of supporting 128-bit encryption. Current browsers such as these will activate the appropriate security features when you enter an online transaction through this site. Furthermore, we take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of credit cards, debit cards, charge cards, and other access numbers under our control. Card numbers are stored for the duration of the transaction, and then deleted.
<p></p>
However, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of our member information at any time.
<p></p>
<div><strong>Business transitions</strong></div>
In the event Clever machine goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
