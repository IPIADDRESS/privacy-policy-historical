<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>We have a few fundamental principles about privacy and the information we collect:</p>
<ul id="priv">
<li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
<li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you submit, post or display through SameID.net.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>SameID.net operates web-based services. It is SameID.net's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites. This privacy policy describes the choices available to you regarding our use of the personal information we collect and how you can access and update this information.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, contact admin@SameID.net.</p>


<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, SameID.net collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SameID.net's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SameID.net’s visitors use its website. From time to time, SameID.net may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>SameID.net also uses third party tracking-utility partners who use log files to collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. SameID.net does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p> 


<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to SameID.net's websites choose to interact with SameID.net in ways that require SameID.net to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SameID.net gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up as a user at SameID.net to provide an email address. We also provide them the opportunity to provide additional information such as name and phone number. Those who engage in transactions with SameID.net – by purchasing a account plan at SameID.net, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, SameID.net collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with SameID.net. SameID.net does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>


<h2>Opt-Out Policy</h2>
<p>SameID.net offers its visitors and customers a means to choose how we may use information provided. If, at any time after registering for information or ordering services at SameID.net, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about sharing your information with third parties as outlined in this privacy policy, simply send us a request at admin@SameID.net</p>


<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p>SameID.net may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. SameID.net may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, SameID.net does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>


<h2>Access to Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete/deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at admin@SameID.net. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.</p>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>


<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>SameID.net discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on SameID.net’s behalf or to provide services available at SameID.net’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others including a credit card processing company to bill you for goods services and an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf.</p>
<p>Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using SameID.net websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>
<p>SameID.net will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, SameID.net discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, or when SameID.net believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SameID.net, third parties or the public at large.</p>
<p>In the event SameID.net goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of SameID.net and have supplied your email address, SameID.net may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with SameID.net and our products. . If you wish to no longer receive our newsletters you may follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in the email communications you receive.</p>
<p>We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</p>
