            <p><br>
            <strong>Cookies: </strong>Our Website uses a technology called "cookies".&nbsp; A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return.&nbsp; If you have registered with our Website, these cookies (1) may let us know who you are, (2) may be necessary to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver products and personalized services, and (3) will provide us and our service providers with information that we will use to personalize our Website in accordance with your preferences.&nbsp; You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.&nbsp; However, if you decide not to accept cookies from our Website, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of our Website.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
We may also use a third party to help us gather and analyze information about the areas that you visit on the Website to evaluate and improve the customer experience and the convenience of the Website, and to help us evaluate some of the specific information related to your Website visits.
            <p><br>
              <strong>Tracer Tags &amp; Web Beacons:  </strong>Our Website may also use a technology called "tracer tags" or “Web Beacons”.&nbsp; This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our Website. These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our Website for you and other future visitors to our Website.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
We may also use third parties to serve our advertisements on other websites.&nbsp; These companies may use tracer tags or web beacons to report certain information (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to our Website and the websites which advertise and feature links to our Website, in order to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements.
            <p><br>
            <strong>Third party links: </strong>Our Website may contain links to other sites that SampleSource does not own or operate.&nbsp; Also, links to our Website may be featured on third party websites on which we advertise.&nbsp; Except as provided herein, we will not provide any of your personal information to these third parties without your consent.&nbsp; We provide links to third party websites as a convenience to the user.&nbsp; These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked websites.&nbsp; The linked websites have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully.&nbsp; We do not have any control over such websites, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose, secure and otherwise treat your personal information.</p>
