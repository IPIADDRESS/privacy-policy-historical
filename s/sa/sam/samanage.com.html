          <h1>SAManage Privacy Policy</h1>
          <br> 
          <p>Last updated 11/1/2007</p><br>
          <h2><strong>Purpose</strong></h2>

SAManage will  update this policy promptly if and when any of the policies described here  changes. When we make changes to this policy, we will post an announcement on our  website with details on the changes made.</p>

        <h2><strong>Cookies</strong></h2>
        <p>When you  are using the  Service we strive to make the service easy to use and valuable to you and your company. When you visit  our website or Service, our server might implement a cookie on  your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard  drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the  site previously and how they have used the site and our Service. Cookies do not identify you personally but your internet browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to SAManage, such as responding to a  promotional offer or opening an account, you remain anonymous to SAManage. </p>
        <p>SAManage uses  session cookies (cookies that exist only during an online session) containing  encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you  are logged in to the Service. This information allows SAManage to process your   requests. Session cookies help us ensure your identity during your session and after you have logged into the system, and are required to use the Service.

Such third parties may use cookies to help  track visitor behavior.</p>
    <h2><strong>Third  Party Sites</strong></h2>
    <p>The SAManage Website or Service may contain links to other web sites. SAManage is not responsible for the privacy  practices or the content of these other web sites.
