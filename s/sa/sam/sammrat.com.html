<h3>Sammrat Ventures - Privacy Policy </h3>


  
   
<p> This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Sammrat.com.</p>

<p>We want to build your trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. We are 
committed to your privacy and are disclosing our information practices in this company statement. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We promise that we will take steps 
to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following policies are only 
in effect for the Web pages, newsletters, discussion lists and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by Sammrat.com.</p>

<p><b>Collecting Information</b></p> 

<p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's 
"Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the Sammrat.com Network, our Web 
servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing 
personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our 
traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our Web servers do not record e-mail 
addresses of the visitors. </p> 

<p><b>Use of Cookies </b></p> 

<p>From time to time, Sammrat.com or its advertisers may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of 
data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off 
your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify 
which areas of Sammrat.com Network of Web pages you have visited, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily 
accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement. We and our 
advertisers may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our site.</p>  

<p>You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all 
cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your 
experience at our site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.</p>  

<p><b>Information Request </b></p> 

<p>We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional 
services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information about seminars) Whenever we 
request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. 
We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy, that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address 
to a third-party, without your consent. </p> 

<p>In addition, Sammrat.com will not send you email that you have not agreed to receive. We may from time to time send e-mail 
announcing new Sammrat.com products and services. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may 
receive mailings from other reputable, third-party companies. </p> 

<p>If you choose to purchase something online, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, 
and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This 
information may also be used by us to notify you of related product and services, but will not be shared or sold to third 
parties for any purpose. </p> 

<p><b>Disclose of Information to Outside Third Parties </b></p> 

<p>Sammrat.com will disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is 
necessary to: <br>

1. Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on Sammrat.com<br>

2. Protect and defend the rights or property of Sammrat.com, or visitors to Sammrat.com<br>

3. Identify persons who may be violating the law, the legal notice, or the rights of third parties, <br>

4. Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities. Sammrat.com uses reasonable precautions to keep the 
information disclosed to us secure. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any 
third parties which receive the information. Sammrat.com also links to a wide variety of other sites and contains 
advertisements of third parties. We are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their 
users. </p> 


<p><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information </b></p> 

<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your email address), we will endeavor to provide a way 
to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. Please email information to sales@ sammrat.com</p> 

<p><b>Newsletter</b></p>  

<p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter or email updates, we ask for contact information such as first name and 
email address. This information is only used to send out the information requested. Names collected are not used at this 
time. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. 
Please see our choice and opt-out below. </p>  

<p><b>Choice/Opt-out</b></p>  

<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these communications 
by sending an email to leave-sammrat@sammrat.com.<br>
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our 
users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.</p> 

<p><b>Information Collection and Use </b></p> 

<p>Sammrat.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this 
information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Sammrat.com presently collects 
information from its users at different points on its website as follows. </p>

<p><b>Sharing Information </b></p> 

<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers if requested. This is not linked to 
any personal information that can identify any individual person or computer. </p>

<p>We may partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share 
names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. If you do not want 
your personal information shared, please email support@sammrat.com with your request.</p> 

<p>The parties listed above are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing 
these services. </p>

<p><b>Surveys &amp; Contests </b></p> 

<p>From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or 
contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 
Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information 
(such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information 
will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. </p>

<p><b>Your Consent To This Agreement </b></p> 

<p>By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of information by Sammrat.com  as specified above. If we 
decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what 
information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. </p>
