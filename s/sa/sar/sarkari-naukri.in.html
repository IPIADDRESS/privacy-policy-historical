<br>Privacy Policy<br>






We at SarkarJobs  recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use and the blog , and how we safeguard your information. 

We use third party advertisements such as Google Adsense and Adbrite to get Financial Support. These programs match the content with the advertisements and present them on the site so that any publisher may receive the " portion of advertising amount" based upon clicks or impressions to support the site.

Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. However You don't need to worry as this is generally used for geo targeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). This is used by almost all sites on which advertisements are shown.

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs . However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
