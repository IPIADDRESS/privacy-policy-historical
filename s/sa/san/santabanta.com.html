<h3>Santabanta.com's Privacy Statement</h3>
<p>Wow, you <i>are</i> interested… We hope the following information can help 
answer any questions you might have. And if you still want to know more, please 
drop us a line at <a href="mailto:privacy@corpz.com."></a><a href="mailto:jdghai@rediffmail.com">mailto:jdghai@rediffmail.com</a></p>
<p>The following Privacy Statement discloses the information gathering and 
dissemination practices for Santabanta.com’s Network of Web sites (which we 
collectively refer to below as the “Site”). </p>
<p>Our Site, like most other sites, uses cookies to provide you with a more 
personalized and user-friendly experience. A cookie is a message that is sent to 
a browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies 
help us keep track of the size of our audience, the frequency of visits to our 
Site and the areas that are most popular. If a guest makes a purchase, cookies 
are used to keep the shopping cart active during the shopping process. We may 
also use cookies to help us deliver content or advertising specific to your 
interests, and to save your preferences or passwords so you don't have to 
re-enter them each time you visit our Site. Most browsers allow you to reject 
all cookies, but then your preferences, passwords and other information will not 
be saved, and you may have to re-enter information to use certain features of 
our Site. </p>
<p>We may use an outside ad company to display ads on our Site. These ads may 
contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies 
delivered through banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have 
access to this information. Santabanta.com may also serve banner ads that 
contain cookies. We will only share such information with our advertisers and 
sponsors on an aggregate basis to determine the success of any given banner, 
logo or advertisement.</p>
<p>Certain sections, features or services of our Site may require some sort of 
registration, requesting users to give us contact information (i.e. name &amp; 
email), unique identifiers (i.e. user log-on name), financial information for 
purchases (i.e. credit card information) and/or demographic information (i.e. 
zip code, age, and/or sex). The information from these forms is used primarily 
to help shape future content, to notify sweepstakes winners, or to process 
orders for products or services you’ve requested or purchased at the Site. If 
you register as a member, we may email or mail to you or otherwise communicate 
to you informative messages about our services or third party products and 
services we believe may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of receiving 
mailings from us either during the registration process or at any time by 
sending us an e-mail; please see the -------- section below. </p>
<p>We may also log IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration or to 
report information in aggregate form to our advertisers (e.g., how many visitors 
logged in to our Web site). In some cases your IP address stays the same from 
browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access 
provider such as AOL or Earthlink or Satyam, chances are that your IP address 
varies each session—thus making it effectively impossible for us to use your IP 
address (by itself) to determine who you are. </p>
<p>In general, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties 
except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service, or under 
circumstances required by law. We will disclose your personal information when 
we believe in good faith that any applicable law, regulation, or legal process 
requires it, or where we believe disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce 
our rights or the rights of another user. We also disclose aggregated user 
statistics in order to describe our services and reach to prospective partners, 
advertisers, and other third parties. However, aggregate data is not traceable 
to you specifically. We may use contractors to help us with our operations. Some 
or all of these contractors may access our databases of user information. These 
contractors will enter into an agreement with us that places restrictive 
provisions on their use and disclosure of all information they obtain through 
the relationship. </p>
<p>Specific uses of personal information that vary from this Privacy Statement 
(if any) may be found in the policies applicable to the service or feature you 
are signing up for. To the extent that you are notified of uses of your personal 
information that are different from those described in this Privacy Statement 
during your enrollment in any particular service, special program, contest or 
promotion, those uses will govern. For example, if you purchase a T-shirt from a 
specific celebrity fan site, that celebrity may be entitled to receive and use 
your personal information for limited purposes such as e-mailing you information 
about their next film or television appearance. Please be on the look-out for 
additional terms of service and privacy statements applicable to the services 
for which you sign-up or participate in. </p>
<p>The Site contains links and advertisements to other sites. If you 
click-through a banner ad or link and submit your information to that advertiser 
or site, you will be subject to their own privacy practices. Santabanta.com is 
not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites. 
</p>
<p>The Site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups 
available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed 
in these areas becomes public information and that if you disclose personal 
contact information in these areas, others may use it to send you unsolicited 
messages. We do not control the actions of our guests and registered members. 
Santabanta.com encourages our users to be smart about choosing when, and to whom 
to release information online. </p>
<p>Of course there are many other ways we conceivably could get information from 
or about you that are not described elsewhere in this Statement. For example, 
you might email us through one of our customer service email addresses, or we 
may get a complaint about you from a third party. Our practices with respect to 
such information are pretty much as you’d expect -- we use and disclose this 
information in a commercially reasonable business manner. </p>
<p>This site has industry consistent security measures in place to protect the 
loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. But since the 
Internet cannot be made absolutely secure, Santabanta.com assumes no liability 
for disclosure of data due to errors in transmission or unauthorized third 
parties.</p>
<p>If you are a minor under 12, you are prohibited from submitting any personal 
information to us. </p>
<p>Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving 
promotional/marketing information from Santabanta.com and our partners. We also 
provide instructions for how to unsubscribe to future mailings at the bottom of 
each communication. Please remember to check the registration screens applicable 
to the service or promotion for which you are signing up for specific 
instructions from our partners on how to update your user profile and/or opt out 
of receiving offers and mailings. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this 
site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact: <a href="mailto:jdghai@rediffmail.com">mailto:jdghai@rediffmail.com</a></p>
<p>By using the Site, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Statement. If 
you are not comfortable with any policy described in this Privacy Statement, you 
may feel free to e-mail us with questions or concerns, but your only remedy is 
to discontinue use of the Site. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy 
Statement at any time. </p>
