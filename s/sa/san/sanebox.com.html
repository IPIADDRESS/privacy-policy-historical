<h1 class="page-title">Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="grid_22 prefix_1">
<p>
(Thank you
<a href="http://www.bbbonline.org/privacy/sample_privacy.asp" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Better Business Bureau</a>
 for the bulk of this privacy policy.)
</p>

<p>
This policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect your
personal information. You accepted this policy when you signed up for
our Service. We may amend this policy at any time by posting a revised
version on our website. The revised version will be effective at the
time we post it.  Should a revision prove unacceptable to you, please
contact us (see below).  We last modified this policy on March 2,
2010.
</p>

<h2>Our Commitment To Privacy</h2>
<p>
Your privacy is important to us.  To better protect your privacy we
provide this notice explaining our online information practices and
the choices you can make about the way your information is collected
and used.  It represents our good-faith efforts to ensure your privacy
and provide you with a great service.
</p>

<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on
  the SaneBox. The types of personal information
  collected include:
</p><ul>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>For third party site-support (e.g., Google Mail) we may have to store authorization credentials and related information for other sites.  We will make it clear that we are requesting this information before you provide it and you can contact to have it removed.</li>
<li>Data you give us permission to access (e.g., your Google Mail or Contacts)</li>
<li>Comments you make in our forums or elsewhere on our website</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>The Way We Use Information</h2>
<p>
We use your email address to communicate with you and to authenticate
with 3rd party products integrated with our system.  We will never
sell or rent your email address or ANY personally identifiable information to another company.
</p>

<p>
For diagnostic purposes, our engineers may have access to
private data (e.g., to fix a problem with the website).  Before
gaining such access, however, they must get management approval, and
we are committed to maintaining the privacy of that data.  Regardless,
we will not read the bodies of your email messages (we may have to
look at the envelopes (To/From/Subject/Date) as part of our diagnosis,
but we ignore the bodies of messages).
</p>

<p>
We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design
our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an
advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our
website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our
registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be
used to identify those individuals.
</p>

<p>
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.

We use cookies in order to track authentication and other
session information.  These cookies are not shared with other sites
(unless we explicitly identify that information is being shared with
another site).
</p>

<p>
Of course, all personally identifiable information gathered can be
disclosed to judicial or other government agencies subject to
warrants, subpoenas or other governmental orders.  But absent a legal
compulsion, we have no plans to divulge your information.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we do not use or share the personally identifiable information
provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above
without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise
prohibit such unrelated uses.
</p>

<h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure
the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate
physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and
secure the information we collect online.
</p>

<p>
All payments and payment information on our site is handled  through <a href="http://spreedly.com/info/faq/">Spreedly.com</a> which is fully PCI DSS compliant.  <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/pci_dss.shtml">PCI DSS</a> is the global standard for safegaurding financial transaction data.  No customer financial information is ever stored within our computer systems.
</p>

<h2>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.
For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our
website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our
website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
</p>

<h2>Who Owns Your Data?</h2>
<p>
You own the data associated with your account.  And, at any time, you can securely remove your data from our servers by logging into your account and requesting such a deletion.  This will be true even during a corporate merger or a corporate bankruptcy.
</p>

<p>
We only access the envelope and header information associated with your emails.  The actual bodies of your emails are never downloaded or accessed within our computer systems.  
</p>

<p>
When you cancel your membership,  we not only securely delete all information on our servers associated with your mail account but we also delete any labels or flags we might have created - so not only will we no longer have any of your data on our servers, but also your email will look exactly like it did before you signed up with us
</p>

<p>
If for any reason,  Visible Certainty, Inc. decides to close  SaneBox , all users will be contacted by email and their account information will be securely deleted from our servers in a timely manner.
</p>

<p>
And remember that we will only backup meta data - never the actual envelopes so once securely deleted there is no possible place to recover them from.
</p>

<p>
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we
collect online and maintain via the website.  We use this procedure to
better safeguard your information.
</p>
