        is owned by Choksi Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and Sanjeev Kapoor (the Company).</p>
        <b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Information Collection and Use</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The Company is the sole owner of the information collected on this
        site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from
        what is disclosed in this statement. The Company collects information from our users at
        several different points on our website.</p>
        <b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Registration</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In order to use this website, a user must first complete the
        registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact
        information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user
        about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for
        the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique
        identifiers, but disclosure of such information is encouraged so we can provide a more
        personalized experience on our site. </p>
        <b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Cookies</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive
        containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any
        personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser,
        the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user
        would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.
        If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is
        that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be
        able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that take
        place. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to
        enhance the experience on our site. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site
        (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. </p>
        <b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Log Files</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track
        user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP
        addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
        <b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Sharing</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and
        advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any
        individual person.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the
        user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that
        is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed
        to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these
        services.</p>
        <b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Links</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we
        are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users
        to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every
        web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies
        solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>
        <b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys
        or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the
        user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information
        requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and
        demographic information (such as pin code, age level). Contact information will be used to
        notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of
        monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
        <b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Security</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This website takes every precaution to protect our users’
        information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is
        protected both online and off-line.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive
        information (such as credit card numbers), that information is encrypted and is protected
        with the best encryption software in the industry. </p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information
        mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to
        perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service
        representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees
        must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return,
        they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL
        employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as
        well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about
        the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’
        information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable
        information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can
        send an email to <a href="mailto:inquiry@sanjeevkapoor.com">inquiry@sanjeevkapoor.com</a>.</p>
        <b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Special Offers</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and
        username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services,
        special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present
        the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out
        below.</p>
        <b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Site and Service Updates</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members
        are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important
        information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services
        and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.</p>
        <b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If a user’s personally identifiable information changes, or if a
        user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update
        or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can be done by emailing us
        at <a href="mailto:inquiry@sanjeevkapoor.com">inquiry@sanjeevkapoor.com</a><b>.</b></p>
        <b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Third Party Use</b></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Users of our site are always notified when their information is being
        collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as
        to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.</p>
