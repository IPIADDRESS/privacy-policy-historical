</ul>
<ul>

As mentioned in the beginning of this policy, SanDisk may share your personal information within the SanDisk group to fulfill its obligations to you and operate its business consistent with this policy and applicable data protection law. SanDisk may also share your personal information with third parties in the following situations.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SanDisk Vendors and Suppliers.</strong> SanDisk works with vendors and suppliers to provide technical and customer support, shipping, credit card processing, product fulfillment or other services. SanDisk requires these vendors and suppliers to safeguard personal information you provide to us. To the extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their contractual obligations to SanDisk, these third parties may have access to or process your personal information. SanDisk limits their use of your personal information to the purpose for which it was shared. SanDisk may sometimes permit our authorized service providers to have access to aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information. These transfers of aggregate statistics do not involve personal data.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mergers, Acquisitions and Insolvency.</strong> If SanDisk should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if SanDisk should decide to buy, sell or reorganize some part or all of its business, SanDisk may be required to disclose your personal information, including information you have allowed us to see or use in your eBox, to prospective or actual purchasers or receive personal information from sellers. It is SanDiskâs practice to seek appropriate protection for information disclosed or received in these types of transactions consistent with applicable data protection law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>As Required by Law and Other Extraordinary Disclosures</strong> SanDisk may be required to disclose your personal information: (i) if it believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority, (ii) would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit, (iii) is otherwise necessary to protect our rights or property, or (iv) is necessary to protect the legal rights or property of others.</li>
</ul>

Because SanDisk operates globally, we may transfer your personal information within our global operations to fulfill our obligations to you but always subject to the limitations of applicable data protection law and this policy. Privacy laws differ across the globe.

<p><strong>This web site is hosted in the United States.</strong> SanDisk recognizes that many of our siteâs visitors may not use English as their primary language. Accordingly, in some instances we have made available versions of this web site in other languages <a href="http://www.sandisk.com">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, including those whose privacy laws may be more strict than U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States to SanDisk Corporation. By providing your personal data you consent to that transfer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>EU- U.S. Safe Harbor Adherence.</strong> SanDisk adheres to the Safe Harbor principles agreed to by the United States and European Union relating to data protection. Information on the Safe Harbor may be found <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Parts of this privacy policy may not apply to visitors from outside the United States because certain services are not offered to those outside the United States. For example, SanDisk does not sell its products directly on this web site to European residents or others outside of the United States or Canada. Visitors from outside the United States and Canada must make their purchases through authorized SanDisk distributors. Customer and technical support is available through this web site and via telephone worldwide. These services are provided in the United States subject to the Safe Harbor principles.</p>
<p><strong>STORAGE AND PERIOD OF HOLDING FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
Unless otherwise requested by you, SanDisk will continue to keep the personal information you provided to us. If the reason for collecting your personal information no longer exists, we will delete the personal information at the appropriate required time if legally required by relevant applicable data protection law.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong><br>
No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p>
<p>If SanDisk learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this web site or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this site. SanDisk may post a notice on our web site if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the SanDisk.com web site. SanDisk may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sandisk.com">privacy@sandisk.com</a>.</p>

This web site may contain links to third-party sites, however, please be aware that SanDisk is not responsible for and cannot control the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies for these other sites, as they may differ from ours.</p>
<p>This web site also contains links to co-branded web sites that may display SanDiskâs logo and trademarks but which are maintained by third parties. Such web sites may be identified by the fact that they do not display a âsandisk.comâ URL. Please read the privacy policy on the co-branded site for the applicable privacy practices relating to personal information collected via that site, as it may differ from this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies solely to personal information collected by SanDisk.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY BY SANDISK</strong><br>
If in the future we change the SanDisk Privacy Policy, we will post the new policy on this web site. If this policy is somehow materially less restrictive or protective of your privacy than the current policy, we will not apply the less protective aspects of the revised policy to information you have previously provided to us without first obtaining your consent. If we have a way of contacting you electronically, we will do so in the way you have instructed us to obtain your consent. We reserve the right to change this policy in the future. Your continued use of this web site following a change in the privacy policy represents consent to the new policy to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS</strong><br>
When you provide SanDisk with personal information, if you allow us, we may communicate with you by the method you choose about topics of your choosing. SanDisk seeks your consent to receive marketing communications from us when you provide your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>ACCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, MAKING CHANGES OR REQUESTING DELETION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
You may at all times object or restrict SanDiskâs use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. You may also request access to, correction of or deletion of personal data.
