		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>At SanDisk Corporation, we believe it is important to protect
the privacy of our customers and guests. We know that you care
about how your personal information is collected, updated, used and
shared; and we want to help you make knowledgeable choices about
the information you provide to us.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains and summarizes how SanDisk
Corporation and the SanDisk group of companies:</p>

<ul class="redarrow">
<li class="redarrow">collect</li>

<li class="redarrow">use</li>

<li class="redarrow">and protect</li>
</ul>

<p class="redarrow">your personal information as you interact with
us online and through our customer and technical support
services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to SanDisk Corporation, the web site
located at <a href="/">www.sandisk.com</a>, SanDisk operated web
sites and SanDisk affiliates (collectively "SanDisk"). SanDisk
affiliates include entities owned or controlled by SanDisk
Corporation. In some cases, this Privacy Policy may be tailored to
account for variances in law in a particular country. However, this
policy is intended to be global in nature. If you are visiting from
outside the United States there may be special rules or limitations
on your use of this web site or other SanDisk operated web
sites.</p>

<p><strong>By using our web site, you consent to the collection and
use of your personal information by SanDisk consistent with
applicable data protection law and this policy.</strong></p>

<p>This policy explains:</p>

<ul>
<li>What information SanDisk gathers from you. &nbsp;</li>

<li>How SanDisk uses the personal information you share with us and
that we learn about you because of our relationship. &nbsp;</li>

<li>How SanDisk uses "cookies" and "IP Addresses". &nbsp;</li>

<li>What personal information, if any, SanDisk may share about you
and the conditions we use to protect your information if it must be
shared. &nbsp;</li>

<li>What kind of security measures SanDisk takes to protect your
information from accidental loss or disclosure and how SanDisk will
inform you in the event of a security breach. &nbsp;</li>

<li>The circumstances under which you can you access personal
information you share with SanDisk and have that information
corrected, restrict SanDisk's use of that information or, even have
it removed from our records. &nbsp;</li>

<li>Other things you should know about privacy and SanDisk.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>COLLECTED INFORMATION AND USAGE</strong></p>

<p>SanDisk collects and uses information you provide to us
including information obtained from your use of this web site. We
are not in the business of selling information about you. SanDisk
does not share your personal information with third parties for
their direct marketing purposes. We may use or share your personal
information (e.g., name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address) where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or
do something that you have asked us to do.</p>

<ul>
<li>For example, we might need to provide your name, address, phone
number or email to one of our vendors so that they can process and
fulfill your product return or replacement.</li>

<li>We might also refer your personal information to another
manufacturer so that they can provide you with technical assistance
you request for their product which you may be using in conjunction
with one of our products. &nbsp;</li>

<li>SanDisk employees, agents and service providers who need to
access personal information you have provided to fulfill their
responsibilities may do so consistent with SanDisk policies that
limit access to this type of information.</li>
</ul>

<p>SanDisk's vendors and suppliers may process your personal data
under the direction and control of SanDisk. Whenever we may need to
share your personal information, we try to provide you with the
information you need to make informed reasonable choices and we
manage your information consistent with applicable privacy law.</p>

<p>SanDisk collects and uses personal information from you in
several ways:</p>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><strong>Web Site Usage.</strong> SanDisk, or SanDisk vendors
and suppliers, may observe your activities, preferences, and
transactional data (such as your IP address and browser type) as
well as pages you have viewed during your use of this web site.
While we may collect or log this information, we do not identify
you or match this non-personal information with your other personal
information. We may use this collected or logged information to
diagnose web site technical problems, or to facilitate your use of
the site. SanDisk, or one of our vendors or suppliers, also may use
this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout
this web site.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>E-Commerce</strong>. You may be asked to share personal
information such as your name, address and telephone number in
order to complete a transaction. When you purchase a SanDisk
product online you may be asked for information needed to complete
your order, contact you to confirm the order and, provide related
customer service. This information is used, for example, to effect
your transactions, to create and share aggregate reports about
these transactions, and to perform credit fraud screening services
for transactions between you and SanDisk and/or our authorized
service providers. When you buy direct from SanDisk these purchase
transactions may be conducted through SanDisk vendors and suppliers
including Digital River, Inc. ("Digital River"). Digital River and
any other vendor or supplier engaged by SanDisk has their use of
your personal information limited by this privacy policy,
contractual restrictions and applicable law. In such cases, these
distributors may be the merchant of record and the handling of any
personal information you may provide to them shall also be subject
to their privacy policy.&nbsp;To visit Digital River's privacy
policy click <a href="http://corporate.digitalriver.com/store/driv/Corp/sectionName.company/subSectionName.corpPolicies/page.corpPolicies">
here</a><strong>.</strong> Please note that SanDisk (through
Digital River or other vendors or suppliers) may limit the
acceptance of orders to particular jurisdictions and as permitted
by applicable law. &nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Product Registration &amp; Technical
Support.</strong>&nbsp;SanDisk allows all purchasers of its
products to register their products online. Personal information or
data provided via online product registration forms is used to
carry out the request, service or agreement for which the
information is submitted. With your consent, we may also use the
information you provide in online registration forms to notify you
periodically about important changes to the web site (such as a
change to this privacy policy or notice of a security breach), new
SanDisk products and services, and special offers and contests that
may be of interest to you. When you register, we ask for, among
other things, your name, address, email, telephone number, type of
product purchased and serial number or other product-identifying
information, and date of purchase.<br>
<br>
You are also invited to share other personal information about
yourself through what is known as a "record." When you register
your purchase with us and create a record, you are given control
over and access to the personal information you provide in your
record. We contract with a vendor to manage personal information
you provide relating to product registration. Your record enables
you to control what we know about you and lets you decide how and
when we can communicate with you. Our vendor only processes your
personal information as directed by SanDisk. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Optional Personal Information and Product
Registration.&nbsp;</strong> Some information or data you may place
in your record is not required to register your products. Where
completion of data fields in your record is required, these fields
will be marked with an asterisk. Where you provide optional
information, such as information about your interests and hobbies,
SanDisk only uses this information on an aggregate basis to enable
us to better understand our customers, develop new products, and
improve our products and services.</li>
</ul>

<p>SanDisk limits the access to and use of your personal
information by our vendors and suppliers through the use of
administrative, managerial and technical safeguards that are
intended to enforce this privacy policy and assure compliance with
applicable data protection law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Failure to register your product will not diminish the
rights you have under the product warranty.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies.</strong>&nbsp;To the extent web site usage
information is developed in connection with your IP address through
session cookies, we will only use this information to facilitate
your use of the SanDisk web site. Cookies are data files that are
written onto your computer by a web site. At the end of your visit,
the session cookies are removed.<br>
<br>
SanDisk does not use cookies other than the session cookies
identified. However, our service providers or vendors may use
cookies in order to personalize your experiences and adapt the web
site's functionality to your preferences. If you are visiting a URL
other than SanDisk.com, or a SanDisk web site, including those
hosted by our vendors including Digital River.com or other
non-SanDisk URL, you should carefully review the cookie policy of
these web sites. For users who register their SanDisk products
through customers who purchase SanDisk products online through
Digital River, and U.S. customers who purchase products online
through shopsansa.com, cookies placed by Digital River or another
SanDisk vendor or supplier (as applicable) will remain stored on
your computer until you remove them.<br>
<br>
You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or
to refuse receiving it, including those set by Digital River or,
other SanDisk vendor or service provider. You should be aware that
this may interfere with or make you unable to use certain
functionality on web sites using cookies. For example, many web
sites will ask your permission to use a cookie that will enable you
to automatically log on to the web site. Disabling or removing
cookies may require you to manually log on each time you wish to
visit that web site. You may also delete cookies from your computer
through your browser.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

<li>&nbsp;<strong>Recruitment and Job Applications.</strong>
Residents of the United States may provide us with personal
information through SanDisk.com. Personal information such as that
contained on a resume or curriculum vitae, may be submitted in
connection with a job application or inquiry. We may use this
information throughout SanDisk (worldwide) for the purpose of
employment consideration or your inquiry. We may keep your
information on file for future consideration. <em>SanDisk does not
accept applications for employment through its web sites from
applicants outside the United States.</em> &nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Children.</strong> If under the relevant laws of the
place where you are visiting this web site you are considered a
minor (usually if you are under age 18), or otherwise would be
required to have parent or guardian consent to share information
with SanDisk, you should not send any information about yourself to
us. For example, if you are a resident of the United States of
America you should not submit information to SanDisk unless you are
at least 13 years old.&nbsp; If a person under 13 submits
information through any part of the SanDisk web site, and we learn
the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt
to delete this information as soon as possible. Because we do not
knowingly collect any personal information from persons under 13,
we do not use or disclose such information to third parties.&nbsp;
&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Public Areas.</strong> Any information disclosed in
public areas of the SanDisk web site will become public
information. We cannot control the use of information disclosed in
public forums, such as bulletin boards, blogs and chat rooms. You
should exercise caution when disclosing information in these public
areas and should refrain from disclosing your personal information.
Content posted in public areas of the SanDisk web site, including
advice and opinions, represents the views and is the responsibility
of those who post the content.&nbsp; SanDisk does not necessarily
endorse, support, verify or agree with the content posted. If you
have any questions or comments about any content on the SanDisk web
site email:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:webmaster@sandisk.com">webmaster@sandisk.com.</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WHEN SANDISK MAY SHARE COLLECTED
INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned in the beginning of this policy, SanDisk may share
your personal information within the SanDisk group to fulfill its
obligations to you and operate its business consistent with this
policy and applicable data protection law. SanDisk may also share
your personal information with third parties in the following
situations.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SanDisk Vendors and Suppliers.</strong> SanDisk works
with vendors and suppliers to provide technical and customer
support, shipping, credit card processing, product fulfillment or
other services. SanDisk requires these vendors and suppliers to
safeguard personal information you provide to us. To the extent it
is necessary for these service providers to complete their
contractual obligations to SanDisk, these third parties may have
access to or process your personal information. SanDisk limits
their use of your personal information to the purpose for which it
was shared. SanDisk may sometimes permit our authorized service
providers to have access to aggregate statistics about our
customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information.
These transfers of aggregate statistics do not involve personal
data. &nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Mergers, Acquisitions and Insolvency.</strong>&nbsp;If
SanDisk should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another
company, or if SanDisk should decide to buy, sell or reorganize
some part or all of its business, SanDisk may be required to
disclose your personal information, including information you have
allowed us to see or use in your record, to prospective or actual
purchasers or receive personal information from sellers. It is
SanDisk's practice to seek appropriate protection for information
disclosed or received in these types of transactions consistent
with applicable data protection law.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>As Required by Law and Other Extraordinary
Disclosures</strong> SanDisk may be required to disclose your
personal information: (i) if it believes it is reasonably necessary
to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena,
search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any
governmental authority, (ii) would potentially mitigate our
liability in an actual or potential lawsuit, (iii) is otherwise
necessary to protect our rights or property, or (iv) is necessary
to protect the legal rights or property of others.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTICE TO INTERNATIONAL VISITORS AND
CUSTOMERS</strong></p>

<p>Because SanDisk operates globally, we may transfer your personal
information within our global operations to fulfill our obligations
to you but always subject to the limitations of applicable data
protection law and this policy. Privacy laws differ across the
globe. To help visitors whose native language may not be English
understand our privacy practices, we may provide special
information on our privacy policies that may be applicable to these
visitors in different languages here.&nbsp;If it is necessary for
the purposes for which you have shared personal information with us
for us to share your information within SanDisk's global
operations, we will do so consistent with this policy. For example,
necessary transfers of European customer personal information will
be made consistent with Safe Harbor principles (see below).</p>

<p><strong>This web site is hosted in the United States.</strong>
SanDisk recognizes that many of our site's visitors may not use
English as their primary language. Accordingly, in some instances
we have made available versions of this web site in other languages
<a href="/worldwide">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If you are visiting from the European Union or other
regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ
from U.S. law, including those whose privacy laws may be more
strict than U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your
personal data to the United States to SanDisk Corporation. By
providing your personal data you consent to that
transfer.</strong></p>

<p><strong>EU-</strong> <strong>U.S. Safe Harbor
Adherence.</strong> SanDisk adheres to the Safe Harbor principles
agreed to by the United States and European Union relating to data
protection. Information on the Safe Harbor may be found <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Parts of this privacy policy may not apply to visitors from
outside the United States because certain services are not offered
to those outside the United States. For example, SanDisk may rely
upon distributors to make SanDisk products available
online.&nbsp;In such cases, these distributors may be the merchant
of record and the handling of any personal information you may
provide to them shall be subject to their privacy policy. Customer
and technical support is available through this web site and via
telephone worldwide. These services are provided in the United
States subject to the Safe Harbor principles.</p>

<p><strong>STORAGE AND PERIOD OF HOLDING FOR PERSONAL
INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>Unless otherwise requested by you, SanDisk will continue to keep
the personal information you provided to us. If the reason for
collecting your personal information no longer exists, we will
delete the personal information at the appropriate required time if
legally required by relevant applicable data protection law.</p>

<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>

<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be
100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security
of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own
risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts
to ensure security on our systems. We use secure server software
(SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized
access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please
note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be
accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such
firewalls and secure server software.</p>

<p>If SanDisk learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to
notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate
protective steps. By using this web site or providing personal
information to us you agree that we can communicate with you
electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative
issues relating to your use of this site. SanDisk may post a notice
on our web site if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you
will need a web browser enabling you to view the SanDisk.com web
site. SanDisk may also send an email to you at the email address
you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where
you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a
security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a
security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving
electronic notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sandisk.com">privacy@sandisk.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES AND CO-BRANDED WEB
SITES</strong></p>

<p>This web site may contain links to third-party sites, however,
please be aware that SanDisk is not responsible for and cannot
control the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage
you to read the privacy policies for these other sites, as they may
differ from ours.</p>

<p>This web site also contains links to co-branded web sites that
may display SanDisk's logo and trademarks but which are maintained
by third parties. Such web sites may be identified by the fact that
they do not display a "sandisk.com" URL. Please read the privacy
policy on the co-branded site for the applicable privacy practices
relating to personal information collected via that site, as it may
differ from this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies solely
to personal information collected by SanDisk.</p>

<p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY BY SANDISK</strong></p>

<p>If in the future we change the SanDisk Privacy Policy, we will
post the new policy on this web site. If this policy is somehow
materially less restrictive or protective of your privacy than the
current policy, we will not apply the less protective aspects of
the revised policy to information you have previously provided to
us without first obtaining your consent. If we have a way of
contacting you electronically, we will do so in the way you have
instructed us to obtain your consent. We reserve the right to
change this policy in the future. Your continued use of this web
site following a change in the privacy policy represents consent to
the new policy to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

<p>We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS</strong></p>

<p>When you provide SanDisk with personal information, if you allow
us, we may communicate with you by the method you choose about
topics of your choosing. SanDisk seeks your consent to receive
marketing communications from us when you provide your personal
information.</p>

<p><strong>ACCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, MAKING CHANGES OR
REQUESTING DELETION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>You may at all times object or restrict SanDisk's use of your
personal data for direct marketing purposes. You may also request
access to, correction of or deletion of personal data. For
instructions on changing any of your privacy preferences, accessing
