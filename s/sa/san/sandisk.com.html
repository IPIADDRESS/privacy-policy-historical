<p style="text-align: justify">SanDisk may amend this policy from
time to time, and may do so at our discretion, consistent with

policy, we will post the revised policy here, as well as a notice
in a prominent location on our website and, if we have a way and
are legally permitted to do so, we will contact you by email in the
event this privacy policy is materially changed. The revised policy
will supersede and replace any previous privacy policies effective

after any change represents and confirms your consent and agreement
to any such changes.</p>

<p><strong>Information we collect</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We collect different types of
information, including personal information. "Personal information"
is information that can be used to identify you, including name,
title, occupation, postal or physical address, telephone number,
e-mail address, and other information required to carry out a
transaction, provide a service or deliver a product you have
requested. Depending on where you are based, personal information
may also include your Internet Protocol (IP) address and other
information related to your computer, or an opinion you have
expressed. We collect and store community discussions, chats,
correspondence through our Sites and correspondence sent to us.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We will not collect sensitive
information about you (such as information about your health or
medical history, ethnic origin, political or religious beliefs,
trade union or professional association memberships, sexual
orientation, or criminal record) except with your consent or where
its collection is required by law.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The collection and use of
your personal information may be necessary for us to provide you
with a product or service, communicate with you, or maintain our
relationship with you. Please note that if you choose not to
provide us with personal information, we may not be able to provide
these things to you, in part or at all.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We also collect other, non-personal
types of information about you and analyze it in order to improve
our products and services, and to personalize your experience with
us. This information includes the Internet Protocol (IP) address,
computer and connection information such as browser type, version
and time zone setting, operating system, and platform; product
registration history, which we may aggregate with other
information; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream
to, through and from our websites including date and time; cookie
number; and the products you viewed or searched for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Much of the personal information we
collect is collected online, but we also collect personal
information off-line such as through customer service call centers,
at in-person events, and through postal mail (such as rebate or
warranty cards you mail in to us).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">To offer you a more personalized
experience with SanDisk, information collected through one SanDisk
service may be combined with information collected through another
SanDisk service.</p>

<p><a id="3" name="3"></a></p>

<p><strong>Cookies, web beacons and other technologies we
use</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We use cookies (small files placed
on your hard drive), web beacons, website analytics tools, and the
personal information you provide us to personalize your online
experience and improve our services.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">For example, we use a cookie to
remember the country or language preferences you selected on our
web site. This saves you time, since you are not required to
re-enter the same information each time you visit our site. Other
cookies are "session cookies" which means that they are deleted
automatically from your hard drive at the end of your browsing
session on our Sites. You may encounter cookies from third parties
on certain pages of the Sites that we do not control. For example,
when you buy SanDisk products online through the SanDisk Store our
ecommerce vendor may use cookies. You can modify your browser
settings to control whether your computer accepts or declines
cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to
use certain interactive features of our Sites. Note that you can
always go back and delete cookies from your browser; however, that
means that any settings or preferences controlled by those cookies
will also be deleted and you may need to recreate them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">SanDisk Sites may contain web
beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that may be used to help
deliver cookies on our Sites and allow us to track the number of
visitors who have visited those pages. We may also include web
beacons or cookies in promotional email messages so we can track
whether messages have been opened and acted upon. Finally, we may
use web beacons or cookies, or use third party web beacons or
cookies, to help us compile aggregate, anonymous statistical
information about the effectiveness of our Sites' operations or
promotional campaigns.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">As noted above, we collect
information about you and analyze it in order to improve our
products and services, and to personalize your experience with us.
This information includes the Internet Protocol (IP) address,
computer and connection information such as browser type, version
and time zone setting, operating system, and platform; product
registration history, which we may aggregate with other
information; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream
to, through and from our Sites including date and time; cookie
number; and the products you viewed or searched for. In instances
where this includes use of personal data, this use will be in
accordance with the consent you have given, or otherwise in
accordance with applicable laws.</p>

<p><a id="4" name="4"></a></p>

<p><strong>Use of personal information</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify&quot;">We will not collect any
personal information from you if you have not given us the
requisite consent to do so. We will tell you why we wish to collect
the personal information, and we will only use your personal
information in the way and for the purposes we told you about when
we collected it. We will not change the way in which your personal
information is used unless we have your consent to do so.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Our primary purpose in collecting
personal information is to provide you with a positive and
customized experience with us. You agree that we may use your
personal information:</p>

<ul class="redarrow">
<li>To deliver a product or provide a service you have
requested;&nbsp;</li>

<li>To provide you with product registration, technical and
customer support;</li>

<li>To administer promotions you enter such as a contest or
sweepstakes;</li>

<li>To allow your participation in activities, such as online
discussion groups, communities, and surveys;</li>

<li>To send you communications of interest that you have requested,
such as emails or text messages about SanDisk (including the
SanDisk Group Companies), our products and services, targeted
marketing, service updates, and promotional offers;</li>

<li>To customize, measure and improve our products, services,
content, and advertising;</li>

<li>To personalize your overall experience with SanDisk; and</li>

<li>To transfer to SanDisk Group Companies and Authorized Third
Parties as described below.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify">Our use of personal data for
marketing purposes is subject to your rights, which may be
exercised without charge to withdraw your permission.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">SanDisk will not use any government
identifier to identify you (such as a Social Security Number, Tax
ID number, or Medicare number). We will use and disclose these
numbers and identifiers only for the purposes required or permitted
by applicable law.</p>

<p><a id="5" name="5"></a></p>

<p><strong>Sharing personal information</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Unless we have your permission to do
so, we do not rent or sell your personal information to third
parties. SanDisk does not share your personal information with
third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">By submitting your personal
information to us, you agree that your personal information may be
transferred to parties under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul class="redarrow">
<li>We may share your personal information within SanDisk
Corporation in the US or any of our parent/affiliate/subsidiary
companies worldwide ("SanDisk Group Companies"), to guide decisions
about their products, services and communications.</li>

<li>We may share your personal information with authorized third
parties (such as our vendors) who help with our business
operations, including the storage and processing of personal data
for the uses listed in this policy ("Authorized Third Parties"). We
provide Authorized Third Parties only with the minimum amount of
personal information necessary to complete the requested service.
We do not allow Authorized Third Parties to use your personal
information for any other purpose.</li>

<li>We require that the SanDisk Group Companies and Authorized
Third Parties adhere to procedures at least as restrictive as the
procedures we follow ourselves, including this privacy policy.</li>

<li>We may need to disclose your personal information to comply
with applicable laws, legal processes, and/or to exercise our legal
rights or defend against legal claims.</li>

<li>We may disclose personal information and other information
available to us when we believe, in our sole discretion, disclosure
is necessary or appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or
take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and
situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of
any person, violations of SanDisk's terms of use, or as otherwise
required by law.</li>

<li>If SanDisk should file for bankruptcy or merge with another
company, or if SanDisk should decide to buy, sell or reorganize
some part or all of its business, we may be required to disclose
your personal information, including information you have allowed
us to see or use in your record, to prospective or actual
purchasers or receive personal information from sellers. It is our
practice to seek appropriate protection for information disclosed
or received in these types of transactions consistent with
applicable data protection law.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify">Please remember that any information
you choose to disclose in public areas of the SanDisk Sites (such
as community forums or published product reviews) will become
public information. You should exercise caution when disclosing
information in public areas and should refrain from disclosing your
personal information.</p>

<p><a id="6" name="6"></a></p>

<p><strong>How to access and update your personal
information</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We want to be sure the personal
information we keep for you is up to date and accurate. We will
take reasonable steps to ensure that any personal information you
have submitted through the Sites is accurate, complete and up to
date. You have the right under applicable data protection laws to
access the personal information that SanDisk keeps for you, on
request to SanDisk, except in certain limited circumstances (for
example, where an applicable law requires us to deny such access).

your personal information with us, and we are committed to
protecting it. We utilize a combination of industry-standard
security technologies, procedures and organizational measures to
help protect your personal information from unauthorized access,
use or disclosure.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">By way of example, access to
personal information is restricted to those employees, contractors
and agents of SanDisk who need to know such data to perform their
assigned functions and develop or improve our products and
services. Also, we store personal information you may provide to us
on computer systems with limited access, which are located in
controlled facilities. Also, if we were to transmit particularly
sensitive information (such as a credit card number) over the
Internet, we would protect the information through the use of
encryption such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We have legal obligations to protect
the security of your personal data. Despite our efforts, there
remains the possibility that information may be accessed, altered,
disclosed, or destroyed due to a security breach. In the event of a
security breach, if our investigations indicate that there could be
significant harm to you as a result of such unauthorized access or
disclosure we will promptly notify you and the proper authorities.
We also encourage you to take precautions to protect your personal
information when you are online. Create strong passwords by using a
combination of letters and numbers when creating them, change
passwords often, and use a secure browser.</p>

<p><strong>Data retention</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">SanDisk will not retain your
personal information longer than is necessary to honor your
choices, fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as
required by applicable laws and regulations (which, for example,
may require us to retain certain transactional data). Your personal
information will be destroyed or permanently de-identified in a
secure manner when it is no longer required. For example, when the
information is printed on paper it will be deleted/destroyed by
shredding or incineration; where the information is stored
electronically, it will be deleted by technical means to render the
information unusable.</p>

<p><strong>Links to other websites and social media
platforms</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Our Sites may contain links to
third-party websites or social media platforms such as Facebook,
LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube, which are outside of our control
and are not covered by this privacy policy. Although we
occasionally review the content of these third-party websites, in
general we do not do so, and therefore we do not accept any
responsibility for their content. You should review the privacy
policies posted on these other sites.</p>

<p><strong>Children and privacy</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">SanDisk does not sell products for
purchase by children. If you are a minor in your country of
residence, you may use SanDisk Sites and our services only with the
involvement of your parent or guardian. For example, in the United
States SanDisk does not knowingly collect personal information from
children under the age of 13. If we learn that we inadvertently
have collected personal information from a minor under the age of
13, we will delete that data from our systems.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer of personal information, Safe
Harbor</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We may transfer your personal
information to SanDisk Corporation in the US or to any SanDisk
Group Companies worldwide, or to Authorized Third Parties acting on
our behalf for the purposes of processing, storage or fulfillment.
The SanDisk Group Companies and Authorized Third Parties who may
receive your personal information in accordance with this privacy
policy and the databases in which your personal information is
stored may be located at facilities located across the world and
not necessarily in the country in which you are located.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>If you are visiting from the
European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection
and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your
personal information to the United States to SanDisk Corporation
and to other countries where the SanDisk Group Companies operate,
whose privacy laws may be less strict. By providing your personal
information you consent to that transfer.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">SanDisk participates in the U.S.
Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor principles for online,
off-line and manually processed personal information. For more
