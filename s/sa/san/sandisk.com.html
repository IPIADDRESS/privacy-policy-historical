                    <li><strong>EU Safe Harbor Adherence. </strong>SanDisk adheres 
                      to the Safe Harbor principles agreed to by the United States 
                      and European Union relating to data protection. Information

                      Parts of this privacy policy may not apply to visitors from 
                      outside the United States because certain services are not 
                      offered to those outside the United States. For example, 
                      SanDisk does not sell its products directly on this web 
                      site to residents of the EU. Visitors from that area must 
                      make their purchases through authorized SanDisk distributors. 
                      Customer and technical support is available through this 
                      web site and via telephone for our European customers. These 
                      services are provided in the United States subject to the 
                      Safe Harbor principles.<br>

                    </strong>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed 
                    to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant 
                    the security of any information you transmit to us and you 
                    do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, 
                    we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. 
                    We use secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect 
                    your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, 
                    or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee 
                    that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered 
                    or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server 
                    software.</p>
                  <p> If SanDisk learns of a security systems breach we may attempt 
                    to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate 
                    protective steps. By using this web site or providing personal 
                    information to us you agree that we can communicate with you 
                    electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative 
                    issues relating to your use of this site. SanDisk may post 
                    a notice on our web site if a security breach occurs. If this 
                    happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view 
                    the SanDisk.com web site. SanDisk may also send an email to 
                    you at the email address you have provided to us in these 
                    circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a 
                    legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. 
                    To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to 
                    withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you 
                    should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sandisk.com">privacy@sandisk.com</a>.</p>
