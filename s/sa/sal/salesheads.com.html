SalesHeads reserves the right and you agree to allow SalesHeads to rent, lease, sell or otherwise profit in any legal way it deems apppropriate or necessary from the information you, its user, provide to SaleseHeads, up to and including the sharing and/or selling and/or renting and/or leasing of data about you and regarding you including your email address, phone number(s), physical and/or mailing address, etc.   
</p>
<p>	<b>SalesHeads Partners</b><br>

                    sites and services on the Internet. When you REGISTER with any of these
              services affiliated with SalesHeads your registration information may or may not be shared 
                    with the owner of the specific career portal or service. The owner of 
                    the career portal shall maintain your registration information 
                    in accordance with its privacy policy.  SalesHeads reserves the right and you agree to allow SalesHeads to rent, lease, sell or otherwise profit in any legal way it deems apppropriate or necessary from the information you, its user, provide to SaleseHeads, up to and including the sharing and/or selling and/or renting and/or leasing of data about you and regarding you including your email address, phone number(s), physical and/or mailing address, etc.   </p>
                  <p>
<b>Web Sites and Newsletters</b><br>
                    When you REGISTER with our site or partner sites or subscribe to receive 
                    our newsletter, we may ask for your contact 
                    information (such as your email address) and your demographic 
                    information (such as your zip code, industry, and job function). 
                    We use demographic information to report marketing information to our partners and to help determine what services may be of interest to our core user group.  When you REGISTER at SalesHeads, you grant permission for SalesHeads to share your registration information with its partners in any way it deems appropriate.  SalesHeads reserves the right and you agree to allow SalesHeads to rent, lease, sell or otherwise profit in any legal way it deems apppropriate or necessary from the information you, its user, provide to SaleseHeads, up to and including the sharing and/or selling and/or renting and/or leasing of data about you and regarding you including your email address, phone number(s), physical and/or mailing address, etc.   </p>  
                  
                  <p> <b>Resumes (If you 
                    are a Job Seeker)</b><br>
                    Since 
                    SalesHeads is a career site, we give you the option 
                    of putting your resume in our database.  If you register your resume in our database we may extract information from it such as your email address, your zip code or your area code.  On occasion we may engage in the sale or rental of certain information contained in your resume to businesses interested in collecting such information.  SalesHeads may scan this database from time to time (for both searchable and confidential information) to collect email addresses for inclusion in its newsletter or for other marketing purposes for itself or its partners, affiliates or customers. There are several 
                    ways of putting your resume into our database(s).  If you 
                      allow your resume to be searchable, then all recruiters 
                      who pay for access to our resume database product will have 
                      access to your resume. We use our best efforts to grant 
                      access to this database only to paying recruiters, hiring 
                      managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals. 

                  However, 
                  we are not responsible if a third party, such as someone 
                  posing as the aforementioned and paying for the service, evades 
                  security measures and gains access to the database and, subsequently, 
                  your resume. You may remove your resume from our searchable 
                  database at any time. However, recruiters who have paid for 
                  access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume 
                  in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for 
                  the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances. 
                  
                  </p><p>Except as otherwise set 
                    forth in this Privacy Policy, SalesHeads will not disclose to 
                    any third party your name, address, e-mail address or telephone 
                    number without your prior consent, except to the extent necessary 
                    or appropriate to comply with applicable laws or in legal 
                    proceedings where such information is relevant. SalesHeads reserves 
                    the right to offer third party services and products to you at any time; such offers may be made by SalesHeads 
                    or by third parties including but are not limited to SalesHeads current partners, affiliates or customers.</p>
                  <p>SalesHeads may send new registrants 
                    or subscribers a welcoming email.  New members and/or anyone who posts a resume on SalesHeads will be automatically subscribed to our email newsletter.  If new members do not wish to receive 
                    our newsletters, they may use the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each newsletter to prevent further mailings.</p>
                  <p>Our web site provides 
                    you with the choice to receive promotional emails from SalesHeads
                    and/or its partners, affiliates or customers. If you choose to receive promotional 
                    emails from any of these, you will be giving SalesHeads permission to access your information on behalf of them for marketing or promotional purposes. 
 SalesHeads may also ask 
                    for your information at other times, such as when you request 
                    information or when you decide to purchase products or services 
                    from or through SalesHeads and/or our customers and suppliers.  SalesHeads
                    will not disclose any of your personal information, except 
                    as described in this Privacy Statement, or when we believe 
                    in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the 
                    rights or property of SalesHeads.</p>
                  <p>The information collected by SalesHeads may be used in a number of ways.  SalesHeads will share broad aggregated demographic information 
                    with our partners and advertisers. An example would be where SalesHeads provides partners and advertisers with information 
                    about the percentage of male or female visitors who visit our sites, 
                    or about the types of industries that users come from.  SalesHeads' goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the most personalized web experience possible 
                    and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right 
                    audience.

                    of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when 
                    they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of 
                    each web site that collects personally identifiable 
                    information. This privacy statement applies solely to information 
                    collected by this web site.  SalesHeads reserves the right and you agree to allow SalesHeads to rent, lease, sell or otherwise profit in any legal way it deems apppropriate or necessary from the information you, its user, provide to SaleseHeads, up to and including the sharing and/or selling and/or renting and/or leasing of data about you and regarding you including your email address, phone number(s), physical and/or mailing address, etc.   <br>

                    <b>Tell an Associate</b><br>
                    If a user elects to use our referral service for informing 
                    a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's email 
                    address. This email address then becomes a part of our database and, as such, is subject to the policies stated in the privacy policy.  SalesHeads reserves the right and you agree to allow SalesHeads to rent, lease, sell or otherwise profit in any legal way it deems apppropriate or necessary from the information you, its user, provide to SaleseHeads, up to and including the sharing and/or selling and/or renting and/or leasing of data about you and regarding you including your email address, phone number(s), physical and/or mailing address, etc.   <br>

                    <b>Security</b><br>
                    When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive 
                    information (such as credit card number and/or social security 
                    number), that information is encrypted and is protected with 
                    SSL (secure socket layer) Encryption. We use 
                    secure servers to protect all of your personal information, 
                    including your name, address, email and credit card information. 
                    It is generally considered safer than giving your information 
                    over the phone. We process your credit card number over 
                    secure servers with vendors such as Career Cast and Wells Fargo Bank.  Whenever we transmit 
                    any credit card information, we use a secure transmission 
                    method. In order to further protect your personal information, 
                    we store your credit card number in a separate location from 
                    your registration information.  <br>
                    <br>

 <b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
                    If we decide to change our privacy policy(s), we will post those 
                    changes on our web site. If at any point we decide to use personally 
                    identifiable information in a manner different from that stated 
                    at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way 
                    of an email. <br>
