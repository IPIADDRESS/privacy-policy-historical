<b>Customer Privacy Policy</b>
<p>
Technology and new marketing practices have increased the amount of
customer information collected and shared in today's marketplace.
Consumers are concerned about the need for protection of their personal
information.  As a financial institution, Salem Five has a special duty to
safeguard its customers' sensitive information.  To serve our customers as
effectively as possible, we must make use of customer information.  At the
same time, we want our customers to be confident that their financial
records and their relationship with the Bank will be treated with the
appropriate confidentiality.  Therefore we have adopted the following
principles to protect the privacy of the information shared with us:</p>


<ol><li><b> Recognition of Customers' Expectation of Privacy</b>
<p>
Salem Five recognizes and respects the privacy expectations of its
customers and will take appropriate steps to convey its commitment to
financial privacy to customers and to bank staff.</p>

</li><li><b> Use, Collection and Retention of Customer Information</b>
<p>
The Bank will collect, retain and use information about individual
customers only where it reasonably believes it would be useful (and allowed
by law) to administer the Bank's business and to provide products, services
and other opportunities to customers.  
</p><p>
Information provided to the Bank or an affiliate within the Salem Five
organization by customers or applicants may be shared with other Salem Five
affiliates, such as Salem Five Mortgage Corporation or Clippership
Financial Services, Inc., in order to offer products or services we think
may be of interest to the customer.  However, the Bank will honor any
request from a customer that their personal information not be so shared. </p>

</li><li> <b>Maintenance of Accurate Information</b>
<p>
The Bank has established procedures to ensure that customers' financial
information is accurate, current and complete in accordance with reasonable
commercial standards.  Should we become aware of any inaccuracies in our
records, we will take prompt steps to make appropriate corrections.</p>

</li><li> <b>Employee Education</b>
<p>
Salem Five employees will be educated so that they understand the
importance of confidentiality and customer privacy.  In the event of a
breach of privacy responsibilities by an employee, appropriate disciplinary
action will be taken.</p>

</li><li>  <b>Protection of Information via Established Security Procedures</b>
<p>
The Bank will maintain appropriate security standards and procedures to
ensure that only employees who are actively engaged in the discharge of
their assigned duties are authorized to access or use customer information.</p>

</li><li>  <b>Restrictions on the Disclosure of Account Information</b>
<p>
Salem Five will not reveal specific information about customers or customer
accounts to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use.  However,
the Bank recognizes the following exceptions to this rule:
</p><p>
</p><ol type="A"><li> If the customer expressly authorizes the Bank to provide such
information, the Bank may honor that request.

</li><li> The Bank may provide customer information to an auditor or examiner of
the bank, solely for the purpose of an official audit or accounting.

</li><li> The Bank may provide information to an attorney or collection agency in
furtherance of a legitimate bank purpose, such as the collection of a
customer debt.

</li><li> The Bank may exchange information about our customers with reputable
information reporting agencies or merchants in accordance with standard
banking industry practice, so that we can verify the existence and
condition of customers' accounts.  


</li><li> The Bank must comply with certain laws that require mandatory 
disclosure of customer information.  For example, if a customer is involved
in a legal proceeding, the Bank may be compelled by court order or subpoena
to 
produce records regarding that customer's accounts or relationship with the
Bank.  Laws such as the Bank Secrecy Act, the Internal Revenue 
Code and the Right to Financial Privacy Act may require us, under certain
circumstances, to provide certain customer information to government
agencies.  In such instances, the Bank will limit disclosure to what is
required by law.   </li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Maintaining Customer Privacy in Business Relationships with Third Parties</b>
<p>
If personally identifiable customer information is provided to a third
party, Salem Five will ask that the third party adhere to strict privacy
guidelines that provide for keeping such information confidential.
</p></li></ol>
