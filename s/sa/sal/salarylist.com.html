<p class="MsoNormal">1.5 Cookies</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Like most websites, JobsAndCareer.com Network sites use
cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file
which resides on your computer which allows JobsAndCareer.com Network sites to
recognize you as a User when you return to the JobsAndCareer.com Network sites
using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow
cookies, you will not be able to use the JobsAndCareer.com Network sites. Like
the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log
file data is used to customize your experience on our website.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set
once you’ve logged in to your JobsAndCareer.com Network sites account. The next
time you visit the JobsAndCareer.com Network sites, the persistent cookie will
allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in
before using the service. In order to access or change any of your private
information or to send a message to another User, however, you must log in
securely again with your password even if your computer contains your
persistent cookie.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Additionally, if you log out of the JobsAndCareer.com

browser.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by
storing User preferences and tracking User trends. In the course of serving
advertisements or optimizing services to our Users, we may allow authorized
third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any
information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be
personally identifiable but may provide general segment information, e.g. your
industry or geographic location, your occupation, or information about your
professional or educational background, for greater customization of your user
experience. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can
reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt
to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the JobsAndCareer.com Network
sites or services. JobsAndCareer.com Network sites do not store personally
identifiable information in the cookies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when
you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your
name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this
and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
of interest to you. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve
ads based on a user's prior visits to your website. Google's use of the DART
cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their
visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of
the use of the DART cookie by visiting the advertising opt-out page at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/</a>.
(Alternatively, you can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by
visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> .) The cookies of other third-party vendors or ad networks may also be used to
serve ads on JobsAndcCareer.com Network sites. You can opt out of some, but not
all, of these cookies in one location at the Network Advertising Initiative
opt-out website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. If
