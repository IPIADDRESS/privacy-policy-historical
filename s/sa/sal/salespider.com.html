			  </p>
				<br>
				<p><font style="font-weight: bold;">II. HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</font><br></p> 
				<p><strong>
				A. Purposes for Which Information Is Submitted

				be used by that advertiser to send you the newsletter and to communicate with you. Personally identifying information may be shared with third-parties 
				to the extent necessary to accomplish the purpose(s) for which the information was submitted.  For example, if you use Data Capturing Domain to receive

				have access to your email address for the purposes of sending you the newsletter.

				information to allow editorial content and/or advertising on the Website to be targeted to groups of users for whom it is most pertinent. This means 
				that users see editorial content and/or advertising most likely to interest them. In connection with these uses, we may disclose information to third parties, 
				but only in aggregate form.

				<p><strong>
				C. Administrative Use and Communications Related to Your Use of the Website

				contact you or give your contact information to third parties so that they may contact you, to call your attention to products or 
				services that may be of interest to you.  When you submit personally identifying information, if the information might be used by a third party,
