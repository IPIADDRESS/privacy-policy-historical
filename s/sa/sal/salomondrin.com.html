                        and any inquiries;
                        contacting Customer Service;
                        for marketing purposes (receiving newsletter, new products, promotions).
                        The specific purposes for which the data is processed are summarized within the information
                        notice as per art. 13, law decree 196/2003, which is displayed to the user when his/her personal
                        details are retrieved.

                        as sending promotional material on products and services other than those already purchased,
                        news, promotions offered by Salomondrin.
                        In some cases, as clearly stated in the Information Report, the data may be subjected –
                        following express prior permission – to processing aimed at creating profiles based on the
                        user's preferences and purchases, in order to send him information regarding his needs and
                        interests.
                        Notwithstanding that provided for in article 130, comma 4, Legislative Decree 196/2003, which
                        allows the owner to use the data for sending publicity emails regarding their products and
                        services, similar to that already purchased, unless said use has been specifically forbidden.
                        The user's data will be communicated to third parties only following his express permission,
                        except in cases in which said communication is obliged by law or is necessary for purposes
                        required by law for which direct permission of the interested party is not required; in these
                        cases, the data may be made available to third parties who will process them independently and
                        solely for the above-mentioned purposes (for example, in the case of request made by the police
                        or tribunal or other competent organisations or for carrying out obligations deriving from the
                        closed contract, as is the case in communication to Banca Sella S.p.A. for the payments of the
                        purchased products).
                        Any purpose other than the specific one for which the personal data has been supplied will be
                        highlighted in the information report and pursued by Salomondrin only after permission has been
                        acquired from the user.</p>
                    <h3>HYPOTHETICAL EXCLUSION OF PERMISSION</h3>
                    <p>In compliance with Legislative Decree 196/2003, Salomondrin can process the user's personal data
                        without asking his permission when this is necessary to carry out an obligation of the law or
                        when it is necessary for carrying out those obligations taken on by the contract</p>
                    <h3>PERSONAL DATA OF THIRD PARTIES</h3>
                    <p>
                        Should Salomondrin have to process the personal data of third parties communicated directly by
                        one of their users (for example, in the event that the user purchase a product to deliver to a
                        different person or when the personal paying for the purchase of the product is different to the
                        person receiving the product, or even when the user intends to recommend the "salomondrin.com"
                        website to a friend), they will supply said third party with the information report provided for
                        by article 13 of Legislative Decree 196/2003 at the moment in which his data is registered in
                        their archives;
                        it is the user's responsibility however, to get permission to use said third party's information
                        before giving it. All responsibility for the communication of information and data of third
                        parties without said parties' permission or for any incorrect or unlawful use of the same is
                        solely of the user.
                        Permission is not necessary only when said data is communicated to Salomondrin in order to
                        conclude a contract in favour of third parties.
                    </p>
                    <h3>SECURITY MEASURES</h3>
                    <p>
                        Salomondrin adopts suitable security measures in order to reduce to a minimum the risks of
                        destruction or loss – including accidental – of data, unauthorised access or processing that is
                        unpermitted or does not conform to the collection purposes indicated in our Privacy Policy.
                        Moreover, Salomondrin cannot guarantee their users that the measures adopted for the security of
                        the site and the transmission of data and information on the site limit or exclude any risk of
                        unpermitted access or the distribution of data by devices pertinent to the user.
                        It is always a good idea for the user's computer to be equipped with software that protects the
                        transmission of data on the web, both entering and exiting and that his Internet provider adopts
                        suitable measures for internet data transmission security.
                    </p>
