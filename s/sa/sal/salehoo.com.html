          <td><p align="justify">  We believe it is important that you know how we treat information about you
    which we receive via the Internet. Our commitment to personal privacy is
    paramount.<br>
      <br>
  SaleHoo Limited lets you visit the SaleHoo website without revealing any personal
  information about yourself. We will ask you when we need information that personally
  identifies (personal information) you. SaleHoo requests personal information
  from our users at several different points on our website. The personal information
  we collect is used only to respond to your inquiry, process an order, allow
  you to access specific account information, or advise you of special promotions,
  discounts, updates and new products. <br>
    <br>
  SaleHoo is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will
  not use or disclose this information for purposes other than those set out
  in this statement.</p>
            <p align="justify">By using this site or any services provided through
              the site, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of information
              as described in this Privacy Statement. <br>
        <br>
        <strong class="heading-orange">Order and Credit Card Information</strong><br>
        SaleHoo uses "ClickBank", a third-party provider of e-commerce
        solutions, to power the SaleHoo.com site and in doing so, collects information
        about users, including credit card information. When a user purchases a
        product from the SaleHoo.com site, ClickBank provides information about
        the customer, including name, address and email address, to SaleHoo. SaleHoo
        uses this information, agreed to by purchasers at the time of purchase.
        In particular, SaleHoo uses the information to create and validate your
        membership, support the membership and send you information about updates,
        upgrades and new works or services provided by SaleHoo. <br>
        <br>
        ClickBank requests information from the user on the order form, viewed
        by the user as a page hosted on their ClickBank web server. Here a user
        must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and
        financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This
        information is used as explained above. For example, if we have trouble
        processing an order, contact information is used to get in touch with
        the user. <br>
      <br>
      Your credit card information does not pass through the SaleHoo site under
      the terms of SaleHoo’s agreement with ClickBank. ClickBank does not
      share credit card information with SaleHoo. ClickBank keeps your credit card
      information confidential and protects your credit card information through
      the use of industry-standard Secure Sockets (SSL) encryption technology. <br>
      <br>
      We also use PayPal as a third-party payment provider in some cases. <br>
      <br>
      <strong class="heading-orange">Links</strong><br>
      The SaleHoo website may contain links to other websites. Please note that
      when you click on one of these links, you are leaving our website and traveling
    to another website. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these
    linked sites, as their privacy policies may differ from ours. This privacy
    statement applies solely to information collected by this website. <br>
      <br>
      <strong class="heading-orange">Cookies</strong><br>
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that your browser stores
  on your computer on behalf of a website that you have visited. Session (temporary)
  cookies may be used from time-to-time to enhance navigation within the website.
  These cookies are destroyed when the user closes their web browser. Our e-commerce
  provider, ClickBank, uses session cookies and other cookies to facilitate access
  to customer account information in the shopping cart on their site. However,
  SaleHoo has no access to or control over these cookies. <br>
    <br>
    ClickBank's cookies are used only to identify the customer, not to identify
    any specific customer traits. This allows ClickBank to maintain consistency
    in the shopping cart and enable a more pleasant shopping experience. <br>
      <br>
