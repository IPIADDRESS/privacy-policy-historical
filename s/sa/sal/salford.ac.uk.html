<h2>Our use of cookies</h2>

customizable and personalized services.</p>

and stored on your computer's hard drive. For example, a website may use cookies to 
store and sometimes track information about you, your preferences, or the pages you last visited.</p>

<p>Your browser software can be set to reject all cookies, or to ask you if you would 
like to accept or decline a cookie from a particular site before it is set. Most 
browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the Help 
section of the toolbar. You should know, however, that if you reject a cookie, certain 
functions and conveniences of a site may not work properly.</p>

<p>We use cookies on our website for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Store and sometimes track visitor preferences</li>
    <li>Record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart</li>

Data collected by these 3rd parties on behalf of the University will not be used, either by us or the 3rd party, for 
any purposes other than those stated above.</p>

<h2>Registration for access</h2>

<p>Some websites require you to provide some personal information through a registration process 
in order to take advantage of certain website features and to access content areas. For example, 
a registration form might request your name, telephone number and e-mail address. You might also 
be asked to voluntarily provide a list of topics that you are interested in so your website 
experience can be customised to your specific interests and needs.</p>

<p>Access to some of the features on this website requires registration,and the disclosure of some 
personal information, which may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your name</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interactive services and tools</h2>

<p>Interactive services and tools provide website users with a richer and more valuable experience. 
The tools can provide you with information that is customized according to your personal background 
and needs.</p>

<p>Some interactive tools may request identifying personal information in order to function. 
It is important for you to know how your information will be used when it is requested, for 
what purposes it may also be used, and if it will be shared with any other party.</p>

<p>This site does not use interactive tools that ask you for identifying personal information.</p>

<h2>Security of communications</h2>

<p>We recognize that many people are concerned about the privacy and protection of information 
as it is transmitted over the Internet. You should keep in mind that the possibility exists 
for unauthorized individuals to intercept any email message you send over the Internet. In 
some cases, information can be encrypted (scrambled or encoded) to make it very difficult to 
read if it is intercepted during communication. Certain technology and practices allow websites 
to provide an increased level of security for your personal information when appropriate.</p>

<p>We use the following practices on our website to enhance the level of security for 
communication and the transmission of personal information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personally 
	identifiable information that you may provide</li>
    <li>We use e-mail forms to allow our customers to ask questions about our services and programs. 
	These are not hosted on a secure server. The possibility exists that unauthorized individuals may intercept email messages</li>
    <li>We are not responsible for the privacy of e-mail messages except those stored in our system</li>
    <li>When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial or health information, we redirect visitors to a secure server and will notify visitors through a pop-up screen on our site</li>
    <li>We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site</li>
</ul>
<h2>E-Commerce, online donations, and online shopping</h2>

<p>Purchasing items or making donations over the Internet usually requires you to provide your 
personal identifying information and credit card information on a website. Many people 
have become accustomed to on-line commerce as a time-saving and useful convenience. There 
are a number of practices that can make providing your sensitive credit card information 
more secure and therefore make you feel more comfortable about doing so.</p>

<p>At this time, we do not process credit card payments for donations, merchandise, or services 
on our website.</p>

on to any third party.  If you wish to remove yourself from the University of Salford's database please contact Hobsons plc, Challenger 
House, 42 Adler Street, London E1 1EE, or international-enquiries@salford.ac.uk.</p>
<h2>Advertising servers</h2>

<p>On-line advertising, such as banner ads, has become commonplace on many websites. Certain 
websites have developed relationships with third-party advertising servers to display these 
advertisements on their sites. By clicking on one of these banner ads, you will be taken to 
another site with different privacy policies. These third party ad servers may also use cookies 
to collect non-personal information on your preferences and interests via the advertisement you 
decide to view.</p>

<p>At this time, we do not partner with or have special relationships with any advertising server 
companies.</p>

<h2>Links to other sites</h2>

<p>Websites often provide a number of links that offer direct access to other useful or interesting 
websites holding potential value to site visitors. Inclusion of the other sites by links does not 
imply any endorsement of the material or information on the other sites. Users are encouraged to 
review the privacy statement of each linked site before sharing personal information.</p>

<p>This site includes links to non-affiliated external websites. We have the following practices:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We encourage users to review the privacy statement of each linked site, as we cannot be 
	responsible for the privacy practices of other sites</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in our privacy statement</h2>

<p>From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously 
disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, 
we have the following practices:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We will use for these new purposes only data collected from the time of the statement 
	change forward.</li>
</ul>

was originally collected by:</p>
