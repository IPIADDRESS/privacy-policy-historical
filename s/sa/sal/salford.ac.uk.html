Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the Help section of the toolbar.

<li>Customize web page content on visitors browser type or other information that the visitor sends</li>
<li>We will never link the cookie to your personal information</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Registration for access</h2>
<p>Some websites require you to provide some personal information through a registration process in order to take advantage of certain website features and to access content areas. For example, a registration form might request your name, telephone number and e-mail address. You might also be asked to voluntarily provide a list of topics that you are interested in so your website experience can be customised to your specific interests and needs.</p>
<p>Access to some of the features on this website requires registration,and the disclosure of some personal information, which may include:</p>

<p>Some interactive tools may request identifying personal information in order to function. It is important for you to know how your information will be used when it is requested, for what purposes it may also be 
used, and if it will be shared with any other party.</p>
<p>This site does not use interactive tools that ask you for identifying personal information.</p>

    <h2>Security of communications</h2>
<p>We recognize that many people are concerned about the privacy and protection of information as it is transmitted over the Internet. You should keep in mind that the possibility exists for unauthorized individuals to intercept any email message you send over the Internet. In some cases, information can be encrypted (scrambled or encoded) to make it very difficult to read if it is intercepted during communication. Certain technology and practices allow websites to provide an increased level of security for your personal information when appropriate.</p>
<p>We use the following practices on our website to enhance the level of security for communication and the transmission of personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personally identifiable information that you may provide</li>
<li>We use e-mail forms to allow our customers to ask questions about our services and programs. These are not hosted on a secure server. The possibility exists that unauthorized individuals may intercept email messages</li>

</ul> 

    <h2>E-Commerce, online donations, and online shopping</h2>
<p>Purchasing items or making donations over the Internet usually requires you to provide your personal identifying information and credit card information on a website. Many people have become accustomed to on-line commerce as a time-saving and useful convenience. There are a number of practices that can make providing your sensitive credit card information more secure and therefore make you feel more comfortable about doing so.</p>
<p>At this time, we do not process credit card payments for donations, merchandise, or services on our website.</p>

    <h2>Advertising servers</h2>
<p>On-line advertising, such as banner ads, has become commonplace on many websites. Certain websites have developed relationships with third-party advertising servers to display these advertisements on their sites. By clicking 
on one of these banner ads, you will be taken to another site with different privacy policies. These third party ad servers may also use cookies to collect non-personal information on your preferences and interests via the advertisement you decide to view.</p>

      useful or interesting websites holding potential value to site visitors. 
      Inclusion of the other sites by links does not imply any endorsement of 
      the material or information on the other sites. Users are encouraged to 
      review the privacy policy of each linked site before sharing personal information.</p>
<p>This site includes links to non-affiliated external websites. We have the following practices:</p>
