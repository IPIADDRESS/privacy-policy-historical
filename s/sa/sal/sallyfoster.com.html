						    Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal  information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and  disclose personal information.&nbsp; Those  policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information  once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy  Policy.&nbsp; If you want to learn more about  their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third  parties.&nbsp; These entities or their servers  may be located either inside or outside the United States. </p>
						  <p><strong>Aggregated and  non-personal information</strong></p>
						  <p>We may share aggregated and non-personal information we  collect under any of the above circumstances.&nbsp;  We may also share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted  advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties.&nbsp; We may combine non-personal information we  collect with additional non-personal information collected from other  sources.&nbsp; We also may share aggregated  information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors,  for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.&nbsp; For example, we may tell our advertisers the  number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services  accessed.&nbsp; This information does not  contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and  services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target  content and advertising. </p>
						  <p><strong>Third-party websites</strong></p>
						  <p>There are a number of places on our website where you may  click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy  Policy.&nbsp; For example, if you click on an  advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website  that we do not control.&nbsp; These  third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information,  including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us  with information about your activities on those websites.&nbsp; We recommend that you consult the privacy  statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the  "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are  visiting. </p>
						  <p><strong>How you can access  your information</strong></p>
						  <p>You can review and update your personal information by  contacting us.&nbsp; More information about  how to contact us is provided below. </p>
						  <p>You may request to have all of your personal information  collected by us removed from our database by submitting a request to Customer  Service, identifying the subject as "Privacy".&nbsp; We will remove such information within a  3-month period, however, we may still retain certain information associated  with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well  as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions,  take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our web site or our  users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, if certain information has  already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy,  retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies. </p>
						  <p><strong>Your choices about  collection and use of your information</strong></p>
						  <p>When you make a purchase on our website, you will be required  to provide an email address &nbsp;to receive  e-mail messages about special offers and deals.&nbsp;  You will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send  to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future.&nbsp; It may take up to 10 days for us to process  an opt-out request.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may send you  other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as  service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering  you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.&nbsp; Please note that changing information in your  account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications  will only affect future activities or communications from us.&nbsp; If we have already provided your information  to a third party (such as an event provider) before you have changed your  preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences  directly with that third party. </p>
						  <p><strong>How we protect your  personal information</strong></p>
						  <p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical,  electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information  from unauthorized access and disclosure.&nbsp;  For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal  information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.&nbsp; In addition, we use encryption in the  transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and  ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining  access to your personal information. </p>
						  <p>We want you to feel confident using our website to transact  business.&nbsp; However, no system can be  completely secure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, although  we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not  expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will  always remain secure.&nbsp; Users should also  take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and  should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please refer to the Federal Trade  Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for  information about how to protect yourself against identity theft. </p>

						  <p>You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser  settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Click "Help" in  the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.)&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do so, some of the features and  services of our website may not function properly. </p>
						  <p>We may allow third-parties, advertising companies, and ad  networks, to display advertisements on our site.&nbsp;&nbsp; These companies may use tracking  technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or  interact with their advertisements.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our  website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but  they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your  computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly  associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised  websites.&nbsp;&nbsp; They also may combine this  information with personal information they collect from you.&nbsp; The collection and use of that information is  subject to the third-party's privacy policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;  This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and  gauge their effectiveness.&nbsp; Some of these  third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members  of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt  out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org). </p>
						  <p><strong>Web Beacons</strong><br>
