<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>Subject to your prior explicit consent where such consent is required by the applicable law in your jurisdiction, Coty may place small data files on your computer, known as "cookies", in order to facilitate your browsing on the Coty Sites and improve the quality of the Coty Sites. A "cookie" primarily stores information concerning your visits and preferences as to your browsing on the Coty Sites, so you do not have to re-enter your settings when you come back to a Coty Site.   </p>
<p>You can prevent this storing by refusing the cookies when applicable, or by changing your browser settings. Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. However, please be aware that when you disable cookies, some features and services on the Coty Sites may not function properly.  In addition, disabling cookies may cancel opt-outs that rely on cookies, such as web analytics.</p>
<p>Certain Coty Sites may use analytics partners including Omniture and Google Analytics to gather anonymous statistical and analytical information about how you use such Coty Site.  In particular, Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), uses cookies to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics about website users. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of a particular Coty Site, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Your browser settings may allow you to opt out. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.  You may visit Google’s website at google.com to learn more about Google Analytics and any opt-out features provided by Google to website users. By using the Coty Sites, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.  You may opt out of the aggregation and analysis of data collected about you on the Coty Sites by our web analytics vendors by clicking <a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product#optout" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product#optout_1&quot;;return this.s_oc?this.s_oc(e):true">here</a> and <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout_1&quot;;return this.s_oc?this.s_oc(e):true">here</a> and selecting the opt-out link at the bottom of the linked site.</p>

<h4>Pixel Tags</h4>
<p>Subject to your prior explicit consent where such consent is required by the applicable law in your jurisdiction, Coty may use pixel tags (also known as "clear gifs" or "web beacons"), tracking links and/or similar technology to monitor the activity of some of the pages you visit on the Coty Sites in order to personalize your experience, facilitate your browsing on the Coty Sites and improve the quality of the Coty Sites.  Coty may use the information collected through pixel tags, tracking links and similar technology in combination with your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><a id="privacy-jump5" class="privacy-toc-anchor"></a></p>
<h4>HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h4>
<p>Your information (personal and non personal) may be shared within the Coty group of companies (Coty Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries). However, Coty does not disclose or sell your personal data to third parties, except to specific third parties as described below:</p>
<p><strong>Third Parties for Marketing Purposes</strong><br>
Certain promotions and events sponsored by Coty or certain portions of the Coty Sites may offer you the opportunity to consent to the sharing of your information with Coty’s business partners such as Coty’s licensors or promotion co-sponsors.  If you have given your explicit consent, your information will be shared with that specific third party and the information you provide may be used by such third party for their own purposes and in accordance with their own policies (including how to opt-out with such third party). </p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong><br>
Coty engages third party service providers to perform functions on Coty’s behalf.  Examples include data analyses firms, customer support specialists, fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that coordinate email campaigns, sweepstakes, contests or promotions) and web-hosting companies.  Such third parties may be provided with access to your information (personal and non personal) as needed to perform their functions. However, they are not authorized by Coty to use such information for any other purpose or transfer it to anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregated Information</strong><br>
Coty may share certain information you provide in an aggregated and anonymous form with third parties we have engaged for internal business and planning purposes, such as statistics or developing marketing plans. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your personal information.  </p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers</strong><br>
Coty may transfer, divest, assign, share, sell or otherwise engage in a transaction that involves some or all of our assets, including any or all of your information, in the course of a corporate divestiture, merger, acquisition, joint venture, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or any other similar transaction or proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance with Laws</strong><br>
Coty may disclose any information, including personal information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.   We may also disclose personal information where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, as part of the administration of our risk reduction program, or as otherwise permitted by law.  </p>
