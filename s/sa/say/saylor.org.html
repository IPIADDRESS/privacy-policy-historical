<h2>Key Terms Used in this Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong> are unique identifiers usually in the form of small data files placed on your device that send certain information about your activity on the Saylor Academy Sites or in an email communication back to Saylor Academy or the authorized third party that served the cookie. Saylor Academy or third parties may also use Flash cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Saylor Academy Sites</strong> consists of all content and pages located within the www.saylor.org web domain, including its Moodle instance found at learn.saylor.org, its Discourse Forums and any Saylor Academy mobile applications.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information</strong> is information that specifically identifies you or that, when combined with other information, could be used to identify you, such as your name, location, IP address or other similar identifiers specific to you.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking Technologies</strong> are web beacons, pixels, and similar technologies that are also unique identifiers used to track your online activity.</p>
<h2>Information Saylor Academy Collects from You</h2>
<p>Saylor Academy directly collects information when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>sign up for an Saylor Academy user account and create an Saylor Academy user profile;</li>
<li>enroll and participate in online courses;</li>
<li>send email messages to Saylor Academy (including messages to our help desk email: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4f2c20213b2e2c3b0f3c2e3623203d61203d28">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>);</li>
<li>participate in user surveys; and</li>
<li>participate in public forums, webinars, and other interactive experiences on the Saylor Academy Sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>Saylor Academy also indirectly collects usage information about your visit to the Saylor Academy Sites, as explained in the section below titled Cookies and Tracking Technologies. Saylor Academy requires your Personal Information only in limited circumstances when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>sign up for an Saylor Academy user account (name, username, email address);</li>
<li>earn and claim a course completion certificate so that Saylor Academy’s third-party vendor can authenticate your identity or prepare the certificate for use and display by you;</li>
<li>participate in remote proctoring or other course facilitation processes (so that Saylor Academy’s third-party vendor can monitor and assess the integrity of your course activity); or</li>
<li>request an academic transcript.</li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent that Saylor Academy associates the information that Saylor Academy collects directly or indirectly with an individual (for example, you), the association is based on Personal Information in your account profile. You may voluntarily choose to share additional Personal Information on the Saylor Academy Sites, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>in your Saylor Academy account profile (and you may display a limited or full profile to other Saylor Academy Sites users); or</li>
<li>when participating in a course, forum, webinar, or other interactive experience on the Saylor Academy Sites (noting that in some cases, this information is shared with a third party that provides tools or other assistance for the Saylor Academy Sites or a course).</li>
</ul>
<p>Saylor Academy encourages you to use discretion before voluntarily sharing additional Personal Information on the Saylor Academy Sites. (If you later choose to delete your Saylor Academy account, deletion of your Personal Information will be subject to the process and limits outlined below.)</p>
<h3>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information</h3>
<p>Our legal basis for collecting, processing and using the Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Information we collect and the specific context in which we collect it. We may process your Personal Information because:</p>
<ul>
<li>we need to perform a contract with you;</li>
<li>you have given us consent to do so;</li>
<li>the processing is in our vital or legitimate interests, such as properly identifying students for course certificates and transcripts, and it’s not overridden by your rights;</li>
<li>to comply with applicable law</li>

Saylor Academy will provide support to the extent required by applicable law (for example, learners in the European Union) and more broadly when possible, as a courtesy in our sole discretion.</p>
<h3>Access and correct your Personal Information</h3>
<p>Much of your Personal Information is available in your Saylor Academy account. Your name, email address, and other identifiable profile information is editable through the profile settings in your Saylor Academy account except as noted below. Your account dashboard lists all current and archived courses in which you have enrolled and includes links to any course certificates you may have earned. The dashboard also contains copies of your answers and other participation and performance in courses. Please contact Saylor Academy learner support to access and update this or other information. Exceptions: Saylor Academy does not track or index every time or every place on the Saylor Academy Sites when or where a learner may volunteer Personal Information, so Saylor Academy may not be able to help you locate or manage all such instances. Saylor Academy encourages you to use discretion before volunteering Personal Information on the Saylor Academy Sites.</p>
<h3>Restrict or object to the processing of Personal Information</h3>
<p>If you want to manage emails and other communications to you, you may update your preferences in your Saylor Academy account dashboard, follow the steps described in links at the bottom of email messages, or contact Saylor Academy support. You may object to, or request that Saylor Academy stop, its use of your Personal Information for other purposes by contacting Saylor Academy. Please note that if you choose to restrict Saylor Academy’s ability to process Personal Information, and the processing is otherwise required to provide you with various services and products offered on the Saylor Academy Sites, you may not be able to establish or maintain a Saylor Academy user account or enroll for a courses or earn certificates.</p>
<h3>Delete account and Personal Information</h3>
<p>To request deletion of your Saylor Academy account and Personal Information, you should send us an email requesting deletion or cancellation. Because deletion on the Saylor Academy system is a permanent action and cannot be reversed, Saylor Academy may ask you to complete a process that aims to confirm your authority to manage the Saylor Academy account affected by your request. With respect to your Saylor Academy account, Saylor Academy will permanently:</p>
<ul>
<li>deactivate your Saylor Academy account;</li>
<li>remove the active profile;</li>
<li>anonymize or delete forum posts;</li>
<li>delete certificates from provider site;</li>
<li>retire your username; and</li>

</ul>
<p>With respect to your Personal Information, Saylor Academy will permanently delete your Saylor Academy account profile Personal Information from the Saylor Academy Sites. As noted above, to the extent that Saylor Academy associates the information that Saylor Academy collects directly or indirectly with an individual (for example, you), the association is based on Personal Information in your Saylor Academy account profile. By erasing the Personal Information in your Saylor Academy account profile, the remaining information about your activity on the Saylor Academy Sites will no longer be associated with you, except as noted below. These changes will be applied to data stores that are used for operation of the Saylor Academy Sites including for course administration and completion records. Exceptions: Deletion will not apply to historical activity logs or archives unless and until these logs and data naturally “age-off” the Saylor Academy system. Saylor Academy does not track or index every time or every place on the Saylor Academy Sites when or where a learner may volunteer Personal Information, so Saylor Academy may not be able to help you locate or manage all such instances. Saylor Academy encourages you to use discretion before voluntarily sharing your Personal Information on the Saylor Academy Sites. We will make reasonable efforts to delete information, however, Saylor Academy cannot always delete all records of past interactions and transactions. Saylor Academy will retain and use Personal Information as necessary to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce its agreements, and as otherwise permitted by applicable law.</p>
<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>Saylor Academy will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with services; to maintain a record of your transactions for financial reporting, audit, and compliance purposes; and to comply with Saylor Academy’s legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce its agreements, and as otherwise permitted by applicable law. Upon your request that Saylor Academy deactivate your account and delete your information we will follow the process described herein.</p>

We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. In the event we learn that such information has been provided through the Sites, we will delete or remove the information. For Sites users in the EU, If we become aware that a child has provided personal information we will delete their information and terminate the child’s account, except in cases of express parental consent for children under 16 years of age. Children under the age of 16 years must obtain consent from the holder of parental responsibility before using our online services.

<p>Saylor Academy may store information, including Personal Information, on its own servers and also on servers of companies that Saylor Academy hires to provide services.

If you are in the European Union, Switzerland, or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, you acknowledge that Saylor Academy may transfer, process and store your personal information in the United States and other countries, the privacy laws of which may be considered less strict than those of your region. Saylor Academy utilizes reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that attempt to reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information that it collects, receives, stores, or transmits. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure; and therefore, Saylor Academy cannot guarantee its absolute security. While Saylor Academy works hard to ensure the integrity and security of its network and systems, Saylor Academy cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent “hackers” or other unauthorized persons from illegally accessing or obtaining information.</p>
<h2>Security Breach Notifications</h2>

By using the Saylor Academy Sites or providing Personal Information to Saylor Academy, you agree that Saylor Academy can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Saylor Academy Sites. If a security systems breach occurs, Saylor Academy may post a notice on the Saylor Academy homepage (www.saylor.org) or elsewhere on the Saylor Academy Sites and may send an email to you at the email address associated with your Saylor Academy account. Depending on where you are located, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach, involving your Personal Information, in writing.</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy Updates</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy will be reviewed and updated from time to time. When changes are made, the Privacy Policy will be labeled as “Revised (date),” indicating that you should review the new terms, which will be effective immediately upon posting on this page, with an updated effective date.

In order to provide our products and services to you, we may send and store your Personally Identifiable Information (also commonly referred to as personal data) outside of the country where you reside or are located, including to the United States. Accordingly, if you reside or are located outside of the United States, your Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located, including to countries that may not or do not provide the same level of protection for your Personal Information. We are committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the privacy and confidentiality of Personal Information when it is transferred. If you reside or are located within the EU and such transfers occur, we strive to take appropriate steps to provide the same level of protection for the processing carried out in any such countries as you would have within the EU to the extent feasible under applicable law.</p>
