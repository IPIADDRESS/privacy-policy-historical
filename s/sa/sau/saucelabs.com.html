Created: April 14, 2009.

<p>
<a name="gather"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:black">What Personal Information About Customers Does saucelabs.com Gather?</span></a><br>
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at saucelabs.com. Here are the types of information we gather.
</p><p>Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future services for you, improving our service, and communicating with you.
</p><p>Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses saucelabs.com or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of saucelabs.com on other Web sites.
</p><p>E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from saucelabs.com if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.
</p><p>Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.

</p><p>
<a name="cookies"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:black">What About Cookies?</span></a><br>
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features based on who you are.
</p><p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of saucelabs.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to use any saucelabs.com services that require you to Sign in.

</p><p>
<a name="share"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:black">Does saucelabs.com Share the Information It Receives?</span></a><br>
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries Sauce Labs Inc controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
</p><p>Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
</p><p>Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Sauce Labs Inc, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
</p><p>Protection of Sauce Labs Inc and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Sauce Labs Inc, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
</p><p>With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

</p><p>
<a name="secure"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:black">How Secure Is Information About Me?</span></a><br>
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
</p><p>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
</p><p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

</p><p>
<a name="third"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:black">What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</span></a><br>
Sauce Labs does not display Third-Party advertisements on saucelabs.com at this time.

</p><p>
<a name="access"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:black">Which Information Can I Access?</span></a><br>
saucelabs.com gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with saucelabs.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. The list of <a href="/account">information you can access</a> will change as our Web site evolves.

</p><p>
<a name="choices"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:black">What Choices Do I Have?</span></a><br>
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to use a service or to take advantage of such saucelabs.com features as Your Profile.
</p><p>You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the "Which Information Can I Access?" section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
</p><p>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. (If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of saucelabs.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)
</p><p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of saucelabs.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to use any saucelabs.com services that require you to Sign in.

</p><p>
<a name="children"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:black">Are Children Allowed to Use saucelabs.com?</span></a><br>
saucelabs.com does not sell products for purchase by children. If you are under 18, you may use saucelabs.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

</p><p>
<a name="harbor"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:black">Does saucelabs.com Participate in the Safe Harbor Program?</span></a><br>
saucelabs.com does not yet participate in the Safe Harbor program developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union. For more information about the Safe Harbor, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Web site. If you would like to contact saucelabs.com directly about the Safe Harbor program, please send an e-mail to safeharbor@saucelabs.com.

</p><p>
<a name="conditions"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:black">Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</span></a><br>
If you choose to visit saucelabs.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of California. If you have any concern about privacy at saucelabs.com, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.

</p><p>
<a name="examples"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:black">Examples of Information Collected</span></a>

</p><p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Information You Give Us</span><br>
You provide most such information when you search, post, participate in a questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide information when you search for a product; place an order through saucelabs.com; provide information in Your Account (and you might have more than one if you have used more than one e-mail address when dealing with us) or Your Profile; communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire; provide employer information when opening a corporate account; participate in Discussion Boards or other community features; provide and rate Answers. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, and phone numbers; credit card information.

</p><p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Automatic Information</span><br>
Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; purchase history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers to create aggregate activity and usage data across our user population; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; services you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call us. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our Web site for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.

</p><p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Information from Other Sources</span><br>
Examples of information we receive from other sources include updated address information from third parties, which we use to correct our records and communication more easily; account information, purchase or redemption information, and page-view information from some merchants with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical, fulfillment,or other services; search results and links; and credit history information from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or financial services to some customers.

</p><p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Information You Can Access</span><br>
Examples of information you can access easily at saucelabs.com include up-to-date information regarding recent orders; personally identifiable information (including name, e-mail, password, communications and personalized preferences); payment settings (including credit card information and pre-purchased compute minute balances); e-mail notification settings (including Alerts and newsletters); and Your Profile.
