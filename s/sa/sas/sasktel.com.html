    <p>SaskTel places a high priority on the loyalty  of our customers, and that loyalty is built on a foundation of good products,  competitive prices, and, above all, excellent customer service. <br>
      Respecting your right to privacy is an  important part of our service excellence commitment.&nbsp; It is our goal to treat your personal  information with the utmost respect. To us, this includes keeping you  up-to-date on your rights as our customers and providing you with information  on how we use your personal information. Our Privacy Statement outlines our  commitment to protect the privacy and confidentiality of your personal  information. <br>
      SaskTel may update this statement from time  to time as reflected in the date at the end of this document, so please review  it periodically. You are also encouraged to review the Legal Notices and User  Agreement provided on this web site. They too, are provided for your  information and protection. <br>

    <h5><a name="why" id="why"></a>Why We Collect Personal Information </h5>
    <p>Personal information is defined as  information about an identifiable individual. This includes information about  your product and service subscriptions and usage. Publicly available  information, such as a public telephone book listing of your name, address and  telephone number, is not considered personal information. &nbsp;<br>
      SaskTel collects information about you during  the application process to confirm your identity and credit history, when  communicating or transacting business with you, and when providing service to  you. We may also collect information about you from third parties that have the  right to disclose such information to us.<br>
      Telephone calls to or from our service  representatives may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance  purposes.&nbsp; We understand that some of this information  is private, which is why we collect personal information only for the following  purposes: <br>
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To establish and maintain a responsible commercial relationship  with you and to provide you with ongoing service. For example, we will collect  information about you during the application process to conduct a credit  history and / or when communicating or transacting business with you to confirm  your identity; if  you prefer to use pre-authorized payment for our services, we will collect bank  account information in order to process payment. </li>
      <li>To understand your needs and develop and recommend suitable  products and services. For example, we maintain a record of products and  services you receive from us, and we may ask you for additional information so  that we can serve you better. For instance, if you wish to view your bill using  our electronic payment service, we will ask for your e-mail address. </li>
      <li>To manage your account and understand your needs and preferences<strong> </strong>allowing us to<strong> </strong>offer you<strong> </strong>better products and special offers  that we think may be of interest to you. </li>
      <li>To manage and develop our business and operations, including  personnel and employment matters. For example, we analyze the usage of our  networks to plan for future growth. We also collect information from  individuals who apply for jobs with SaskTel.</li>
      <li>To meet legal and regulatory requirements. For example, we may  collect information in order to respond to a court order. </li>
      </ul>
    <p><a href="#"><img height="14" alt="TOP" src="/images/btn-30x14-top.jpg" border="0 width=" 30"=""></a></p>
    <h5><a name="sharing" id="sharing"></a>Sharing Your Personal Information </h5>
    <p>Personal information is not sold or rented to  any parties outside of the SaskTel corporate family, without your consent or as  permitted by SaskTel's Tariff. <br>
      We do share this information with the  companies we select as our business partners, and who supply services to us.  However, we require them by contract, to honour our privacy principles in the  handling of personal information they obtain from us. The information provided  to our business partners is used only for that purpose and any disclosure  outside of SaskTel is made on a confidential basis<strong>. </strong>Should we sell a  part of our business or merge or amalgamate part or all of our business with  another entity, we may need to disclose customer information as part of the  transaction. This is a normal business practice in any such  transaction.&nbsp;Any such disclosure would be subject to appropriate privacy  and security safeguards. In certain circumstances in which it is necessary to  do so, or where permitted by law, we may disclose your personal information  without your consent to the following parties: </p>
    <ul class="ListNoPad">
      <li>the customer or an agent acting on the customer's behalf, such as Power of Attorney; </li>
      <li>companies we select as our business partners;</li>
      <li>a company that publishes a directory or directory-related services, </li>
      <li>a collection agency or party used to determine creditworthiness or, for collecting unpaid balances;</li>
      <li>a credit bureau reporting agency</li>
      <li>courts, law enforcement agencies or otherwise legally empowered entities; </li>
      <li>we may disclose personal information to meet legal or regulatory requirements, such as under a court order or, to a government institution if required or authorized by law;</li>
      <li>to public authorities or their agents in cases of emergency e.g., a 911 call;</li>
      <li>ombudsman<br>
        <br>
      </li>

    <h5><a name="personal" id="personal"></a>SaskTel Personal Information Handling Principles </h5>
    <p>SaskTel has always been, and will continue to be, committed to the privacy of your personal information. In addition to our existing procedures and our adherence to The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIP) which governs our approach to handling personal information, we have adopted the following privacy principles from the Canadian Standards Association's Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information: </p>
    <p>Principle 1 -Accountability <br>

      SaskTel will identify the purpose for collecting personal information at or before the time the information is collected. </p>
    <p>Principle 3 - Obtaining Consent for the Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information <br>
      We require the knowledge and consent of the customer for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information except where it is impractical or inappropriate to do such as in emergency situations. </p>
    <p>Principle 4 - Limiting Collection of Personal Information <br>
      SaskTel will limit the collection of personal information to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by the company.  SaskTel will collect personal information by fair and lawful means. </p>
    <p>Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information <br>
      SaskTel will not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law.  SaskTel retains personal information only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes. </p>
    <p>Principle 6 - Accuracy of Personal Information <br>
      Personal information will be as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. </p>
    <p>Principle 7 -Security Safeguards <br>
      SaskTel will protect personal information by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. </p>
    <p>Principle 8 - Openness <br>
      SaskTel will make readily available to customers and employees, specific information about its policies and procedures relating to the management of personal information. <br>
      </p>
    <p>Principle 9 - Customer and Employee Access to Personal Information <br>
      Upon request, customers and employees shall be informed of the existence, use and disclosure of his or her personal information and shall be given access to that information.  An individual shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate. </p>
    <p>Principle 10 - Challenging Compliance <br>
      A customer may address a challenge concerning compliance with the above principles to the Chief Privacy Officer. SaskTel personnel are required to complete mandatory privacy training courses, and general staff education and training, to enhance awareness of responsibilities and commitments towards the proper handling of customer's personal information in accordance with SaskTel's polices and procedures. <br>

    <h5><a name="choices" id="choices"></a>What Are Your Choices? </h5>
    <p>We would like to have your consent to continue to collect, use and disclose your personal information for the purposes that we have outlined. However, you do have choices. </p>
    <ul class="ListNoPad">
      <li>You can have your name removed from our telephone, mail or e-mail marketing lists. By doing so, you may not be made aware of certain products, services, and promotions offered by SaskTel. However, you will continue to be contacted as necessary to service your account, and you will receive marketing information included with your regular account mailings. Please allow us 30 days to complete your request. Some of our promotions may already be in progress when you submit your request, therefore you may be contacted during this time. If at any time you wish to reverse your decision, you may contact us at 1-800-352-7238. (SaskTel cellular customers may call 1-800-667-2355 to change their preferences) </li>
      <li>Our directory publisher, DirectWest, makes lists of published names, addresses and phone numbers available to selected organizations for a fee. You may choose to be excluded from these DirectWest lists. Please note that non-published names, addresses and phone numbers are automatically excluded. </li>
      <li>You may refuse to provide personal information to us. You may also withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal, contractual or practical restrictions and reasonable notice. However, in either case, this may limit our ability to serve you. </li>
      </ul>
    <p><br>
      </p>
    <p>When you contact us, we will confirm that you are the registered customer. Please know that withdrawing your consent may prevent us from providing you with service and products in certain circumstances. <br>

      </strong> </p>
    <p>The information you provide to us on our web site is securely maintained and kept confidential. Information is retained in secure facilities, and protected from unauthorized access. We provide technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your information against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. <br>
      <br>
      For some services, SaskTel uses service providers located in another country to process and store information related to that service and as a result foreign governments, courts, law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of that country.<br>

    <p><strong>Children
      
      </strong> </p>
    <p>The privacy of children is important to us. We encourage parents to review our Privacy Statement and our Legal Notices and User Agreement documents. We ask that children do not submit any personal information to us. Our services are intended for individuals who can form legally binding contracts. SaskTel does not use our web site to intentionally collect or use a child's personal data.<br>
      <br>
      As an added protection for children, on any of our commercial web sites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, we will obtain the permission of a parent or legal guardian before collecting, using or disclosing any personally-identifiable information about a child, e.g., for participation in contests or promotions.<br>
      <br>
      SaskTel is also a sponsor of Project Cleanfeed Canada, an initiative involving Canada's largest Internet Service Providers who have teamed up with Cybertip.ca to protect their customers from inadvertently visiting foreign web-sites that contain images of children being sexually abused and that are beyond the jurisdiction of Canadian legal authorities.
