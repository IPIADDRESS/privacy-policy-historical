		<h3>Cookies</h3>
		
		<p>Our Platform uses cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platform)and/or other similar technologies such as [device-IDs], [in-App codes], mobile analytics software, pixel tags or web beacons (a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed and may tell your browser to get content from another server) to collect and store certain information. These typically involve pieces of information or code that a website transfers to or accesses from your computer hard drive or mobile device to store and sometimes track information about you.</p>
		<p>Cookies and similar technologies enable you to be remembered when using that computer or device to interact with websites and online services and can be used to manage a range of features and content as well as storing searches and presenting personalised content.</p>
		<p>Our platform uses cookies and similar technologies to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>to distinguish you from other users of our Platform and to facilitate site navigation,</li>
			<li>to associate you with social networking sites and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Platform and your activities on such social networking sites,</li>
			<li>to personalize your experience while visiting our Platform (such as allowing us to select which content, ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location, or demographic information), including personalizing content from the providers of goods and services that you may be able to purchase through the Platform or otherwise (who may pay us to show you such content) · <a class="anchor" href="#ad-services" data-offset="120">Find Out More</a></li>
			<li>to collect information enabling digital rights management, and</li>
			<li>for security purposes.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you use our Platform and also allows us to improve our Platform. Similarly, we may use analytics platforms and other tracking technologies to help us track and analyze usage of our Platform, using cookies, pixels and other tracking technologies.</p>
		<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies and similar technologies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that and your help screen or manual will tell you how to do this. We also give you information about how to disable cookies <a class="anchor" href="#cookies" data-offset="120">here</a>. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our website if you do so.</p>
		<p>A number of cookies and similar technologies we use last only for the duration of your web or app session and expire when you close your browser/or exit the App. Others are used to remember you when you return to the Platform and will last for longer.</p>

		<h3>International Transfers</h3>
		<p>JioSaavn is a global business headquartered in the United States. JioSaavn processes, transfers and stores information about its users on servers located in the United States, India and Singapore. As a result, JioSaavn may transfer your information with third parties located in countries other than your home country. Your personal information may therefore be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country of residence.</p>
		<p>If you are located in India, the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to and processed by third parties in a country outside of your country of residence.</p>
		<p>Where your information is transferred outside the EEA, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is subject to appropriate safeguards, such as relying on a recognised legal adequacy mechanism, and that it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
		<p>We may transfer your personal information outside the EEA:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>in order to store it;</li>
			<li>in order to enable us to provide goods or services to you and fulfil our contract with you. This includes order fulfilment, processing of payment details, and the provision of support services;</li>
			<li>where we are legally required to do so;</li>
			<li>in order to facilitate the operation of our group of businesses, where it is in our legitimate interests and we have concluded these are not overridden by your rights.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Where your personal data is transferred outside the EEA we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that this data is subject to appropriate and required safeguards.  Some non-EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission as having an “adequate” level of data protection according to the standards set by the European Commission.  For a list of these non-EAA countries with adequate safeguards and how the European Commission came to this determination click <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<p>For data transfers from the EEA to non-EEA countries that are <u>not</u> considered to have adequate data protection measures, JioSaavn has instituted other legal and contractual measures to protect your personal data. In particular, JioSaavn requires that the non-EEA recipient be bound by the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses to protect your personal data. To obtain a copy of these Standard Contractual Clauses please click <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
