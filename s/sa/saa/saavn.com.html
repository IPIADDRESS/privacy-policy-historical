		<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
		<h4>Information You Give Us</h4>
		<p>When you use the Platform, for example to register to create an account, update your information, sign up for a subscription, use certain features, access or download content, purchase items or enter into promotions, refer others to the Platform, interact with us via third party application or social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us, we or our service providers or business partners may collect information that relates to you, including personal information, such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, mobile phone number, credit card or debit card details, geographic location, mailing address, date of birth, gender, demographic information, photos, videos, social media account details and other information from your device. </p>

		<p>You may decide to provide us with another person's email or phone number so that person may be invited to join Saavn or so that we may facilitate your communication with other people through the service. Local law may require you to seek the consent of your contacts to provide their personal information to Saavn, who may use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<h4>Information Collected Automatically</h4>
		<p>Whenever you visit or interact with the Platform, Saavn, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Platform is accessed and used ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include information collected in the following ways:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong><em>Log Files:</em></strong> Information is logged about your use of the Platforms, including your browser type, operating system, activations, content you purchase, access, download or burn, access and listening times, the page served and the preceding page views. This statistical usage data provides us with information about the use of the Platform, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Platform, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. It also provides us with information about your interactions with songs, playlists, audiovisual content and other Saavn users, as well as advertising and products or services offered through or linked from the Platform. This information helps us keep our Platform fresh and interesting to our visitors and tailor content to a visitor’s interests.</li>
			<li><strong><em>Location Information:</em></strong> We may collect information about the location of your device when you access or use the Platform; or if you choose to turn on your Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or other geolocation functionality when you use the App, subject to your consent, the App may collect and use your geolocation information. We may share your location with certain third-parties for analytics and advertising purposes.</li>
			<li><strong><em>Device Identifiers:</em></strong> Saavn may automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (<em>"Device Identifier"</em>) for the computer, mobile device, tablet or other device (collectively, <em>"Device"</em>) you use to access the Platform, including the hardware model and mobile network information. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and includes AD-IDs or IDFAs, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Platform, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, help identify, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</li>
			<li><strong><em>Cookies; Pixel Tags:</em></strong> The technologies used on the Platform to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platform), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed). Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Platform and your activities on such social networking sites. We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to collect information enabling digital rights management, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platform (such as allowing us to select which content, ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location, or demographic information). Personalized content may also include content from the providers of goods and services that you may be able to purchase through the Platform or otherwise (who may pay us to show you such content). Note, however, that if a third party content provider asks us to show content to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who are located in a particular locality) and you respond to that content or click on links embedded in that content, the third-party content provider may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach. Saavn does not have access to or control over cookies, web beacons, or other technologies that third parties who have asked us to show you content may use, and the privacy practices of these third parties are not covered by this privacy policy. Please contact these companies directly for information on their data collection and privacy practices. For more information on advertising using, please see the section on <a class="anchor" href="#ad-services" data-offset="120">Advertising Services</a> below. A pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server. To learn more about how to disable cookies, see <a class="anchor" href="#your-choices" data-offset="120">Your Choices</a>, below.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Similarly, we may use analytics platforms and other tracking technologies to help us track and analyze usage of our Platform, using cookies, pixels and other tracking technologies.</p>

		<h4>Information Received from Other Sources</h4>
		<p>We also may obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Platform. For example, if you create an account using your credentials from a third-party social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, profile and account information, such as lists of your friends, "likes", comments you have shared, groups and location, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social media site. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Platform to your profile page to share with others within your network.

		<h3>Sharing of Information</h3>
		<p>The information collected or generated through your use of the Platform may be shared by you or by us as described below.</p>

		<h4>Sharing of Information by You</h4>
		<p>Saavn is a social service that offers many ways to find, enjoy, and share content. Your name and/or username, profile picture, who you follow, your followers, and your Saavn user profile will be publicly available.</p>

		<p><strong><em>Your Activities:</em></strong> Your activity on the Platform (e.g., music you listen to, music you share), playlists created or followed, and content you post to the Platform are made publicly available by default and can be accessed by users who follow you or view your Saavn profile and will also be displayed publicly in third-party search engine results and may appear together with other public profile information, such as your playlists, picture and name and/or username. Although this information is made public by default, in the "Your Choices" section below, we describe the controls that you can use to limit the sharing of your information.</p>

		<p><strong><em>Third Party Platforms:</em></strong> If your Saavn account is connected to a third party application or social medial platform, Saavn may automatically share your activity with that service, including the content you use and such information may be attributed to your account on the third party platform and published on such service. Likewise, if you log into a third party application with your Saavn account, that third party application may have access to certain information such as your Saavn playlists and activity. A third party platform’s use of information collected from you (or as authorized by you) is governed by the third party platform’s privacy policies and your settings on the relevant service.</p>

		<h3>Sharing of Information by Us</h3>

Your information may also be used by us or shared with our sponsors, partners, advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies or other third parties in connection with marketing, promotional, and other offers, as well as product information, and for such third party’s advertising, analytics and market research. These advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies use various technologies to collect data in order to send (or serve) relevant ads to users on our Platforms, or on platforms or websites operated by third parties. These technologies may include the placement of cookies or web beacons, the use of unique or non-unique non-personal identifiers, or the use of other technologies on our Platforms, which may be used to track user behavior, to track how our Platforms are being used, to link various Devices you may use, build consumer profiles and possibly to serve you more relevant ads. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of various technologies by advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies. We may also share your information with the rights holders that license content to Saavn to stream on the Platform.</p>

		<p><strong><em>Your Agreement To Have Your Personal Information Shared:</em></strong> While on our Platform, you may have the opportunity to opt-in to receive information and/or marketing offers from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with a third party. If you use the social sharing features of the Platform, your information may be shared with certain of your friends or groups. If you agree to have your information shared, your information will be disclosed to the third party and the information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of that third party.</p>

		<p><strong><em>Business Transfers:</em></strong> Your information may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries and affiliates for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes. As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets.
