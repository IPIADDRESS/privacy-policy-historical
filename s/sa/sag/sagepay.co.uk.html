       <h4 style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">1. About this policy</h4>
       <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:16px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
       <p style="margin-top:0;">This is the privacy policy of Sage Pay, a  division of Sage (UK) Limited ("Sage Pay"). It applies only to  personal data as defined in s.1 of the 1998 Data Protection Act ("personal  information" or "information") and not other types of business  or general information. Broadly speaking, this is information that enables you  to be identified, such as your name, address and email address. Please note  that this policy will only relate to financial information about you if that  financial information is personal data, as defined by that Act. The policy  tells you who we are, how we collect personal information about you through  this website, what we intend to use that information for, with whom we intend  to share it, how we keep it secure, and how we transfer your information  outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").</p>
       <p>Please read this policy carefully. By  accessing or using this website you are deemed to agree to the terms of this  privacy policy, and if you do not agree with it, then you must not send us any  personal information.</p>
       <p>Note that if you follow a link from this  site to another site, this policy will no longer apply. We are not responsible  for other sites´ information handling practices. Use of your information by the  owner of the linked site will normally be governed by that site´s privacy  policy, which we encourage you to read.</p>

Our registered office is at North Park, Newcastle upon Tyne,  NE13 9AA. Please see our Contact Us section for more information.

       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p style="margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
       <h4 style="margin-top:0;">3. How we collect information from you</h4>
       <p style="margin-bottom:0;">3.1. By the use of "cookies" and  other site usage tracking tools</p>
       <p style="margin-top:0;">"Cookies"</p>
       <p>3.1.2. A cookie is a small text file which  is transferred from a website and stored on your computer´s hard drive. It  enables a website to "remember" who you are. Sage Pay never  permanently stores any personal information in cookies (on any computer that  you may use) that can be used to identify you, such as your name or account  numbers. Please see section 3.1.4 about how we use temporary cookies.</p>
       <p>3.1.3. Most browsers are automatically set  to accept cookies but some browsers, such as Microsoft´s Internet Explorer or  Netscape Navigator, allow you to configure your browser to restrict cookies or  block all cookies if you wish. This will however affect your ability to log  into and use our VSP Admin area, online application form and other restricted  areas of our website. Browser-specific instructions on how to restrict or block  cookies may be found on the Interactive Advertising Bureau´s website at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a></p>
       <p>3.1.4. We use session cookies (which are  temporary cookies) in the VSP Admin reporting system to remember customer  information used to complete transactions through the VSP Terminal. Session  cookies are deleted when you close your browser (i.e. the software program you  use for searching and viewing various kinds of Internet resources such as  information on a website, e.g. Microsoft´s Internet Explorer).</p>
       <p>3.1.5. We do not use persistent cookies,  i.e. cookies remain on your hard disk until you delete them.</p>
       <p>3.1.6. No cookies on our site are  controlled or used by third parties.</p>
       <p><strong>Other tracking tools</strong></p>
       <p>3.1.7. We do use a third party, Webtrends  Inc., to help us collect anonymous information about how our website is used.  For example, the software looks at which pages are most used, and the order in  which they were visited. Webtrends uses SDC advanced tracking code and is a  smart source data collector. Please see <a href="https://ondemand.webtrends.com/privacypolicy.asp#PSFV" target="_blank">https://ondemand.webtrends.com/privacypolicy.asp#PSFV</a> for further information about  Webtrends.</p>
       <p style="margin-bottom:0;">Some of our web pages may contain other  tools to help us understand how users use our website, to help us improve it.  These tools do not store your information or any information which is specific  to you.</p>
       <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
       <p style="margin-top:0;"><strong>Further information</strong></p>
       <p>3.1.8. More information on cookies and web  beacons can be found at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a></p>
       <p style="margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
       <p style="margin-top:0;">3.2. By registration</p>
       <p>3.2.1. We collect information about you  that you provide to us when you register to use the services advertised on our  site through our online application form.</p>
       <p>3.2.2. We need you to give us certain  information that will be indicated on the form that you are required to  complete in order to register. It would help us if you give us any other  information that you think will be relevant but you are under no obligation to  do so.</p>
       <p style="margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
       <p style="margin-top:0;">3.3. Through traffic data and site  statistics</p>
       <p>3.3.1. We do keep a record of traffic data  which is logged automatically by our server, such as your IP address, the URL  you visited before ours, the URL you visit after leaving our site and which  pages you visit.</p>
       <p>3.3.2. We also collect some site statistics  such as page hits and page views.</p>
       <p>3.3.3. We are not readily able to identify  any individual from traffic data or site statistics.</p>
       <p>3.4. By you contacting us by other methods  other than the website</p>
       <p>3.4.1. The website provides various  telephone and fax numbers and email addresses for you to contact us. We will  collect information from you that you provide through any of these methods.</p>
       <p>3.4.2. We may also collect other  information that you supply to us after your initial contact with us.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <h4>4. Security and storage of information</h4>
       <p>4.1. We will keep your information secure  by taking appropriate technical and organisational measures against its  unauthorised or unlawful processing and against its accidental loss,  destruction or damage.</p>
       <p>4.2. Please remember that normal Internet  email is insecure. We do however use secure connections in our direct debit  sign up pages, online application form and VSP Admin area, so please use these  pages when providing us with sensitive information.</p>
       <p>4.3. We will store your information at  least for the duration of any customer relationship we have with you, or as  otherwise required by law (normally up to a maximum of 7 years for legal and  tax reasons).</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p style="margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
       <h4 style="margin-top:0;">5. What your information is used for</h4>
       <p>5.1. If you register to receive services  from us, we will use your information to fulfill your order and to provide you  with the service you have requested.</p>
       <p>5.2. If you register to use one of the  community areas or other restricted areas on our website, such as the VSP Admin  area, online application form or customer management system, we will use your  information to provide the relevant service to you.</p>
       <p>5.3. If you agree when you register with  us, we will also use your information for marketing purposes. If you do not  want the information we hold on you to be used in this manner, you should  contact us either by writing to our Data Protection Compliance Officer at our  registered office address given above, or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@sagepay.com">support@sagepay.com</a>,  and telling us how we may use your information.</p>
       <p>5.4. If you do not object, we will use the  information we hold on you to contact you for feedback on your use of our  services and/or our website.</p>
       <p>5.5. We may use aggregated data about users  of our site, sales patterns and other statistical data to improve our site, but  it will not be possible to identify individuals from that aggregated data.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <h4>6. Sharing your information</h4>
       <p>6.1. We will not share your information  with any other organisation except in the following circumstances.</p>
       <p>6.1.1. We will share your information with  third party businesses with whom we are jointly providing a service to you, so  that this service can be provided. For example if you apply for Sage Merchant  Services we will share relevant information about you to our merchant account  service provider. That third party  may also wish to use your information for other purposes and that third party  should inform you of those purposes. We therefore encourage you to read any  third party´s privacy policies.</p>
       <p>6.1.2. We will share your information with  other Sage group companies, for example Sage (UK) Limited, for them to use to  inform you about their relevant products and services.</p>
       <p>6.1.3. We will share your information with  another organisation to which we transfer, or are in discussions to transfer,  our rights and obligations under our agreement with you.</p>
       <p>6.1.4. We may share your information with  another organisation that buys our company or our assets, or with another  organisation from which we acquire a company or business, and in the course of  any preceding negotiations with that organisation, which may or may not lead to  a sale.</p>
       <p>6.1.5. We may share your information with  our funders or potential funders, such as our bank and with our professional  advisers who have a reasonable need to see it.</p>
       <p>6.1.6. We may, on occasion, share your  information with carefully selected businesses so that they can send you  details of their products and services which are related to ours.  Alternatively, we may on occasion use your information to send you details of  the products and services of carefully selected businesses which are  complementary to our own products and services. If you do not want the  information we hold on you to be used in this manner, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@sagepay.com">support@sagepay.com</a>  or write to our Data Protection Compliance Officer at the registered office  address given above.</p>
       <p>6.1.7. We may provide anonymous aggregated  data to reputable third parties on a commercial basis, but this will not  include information specifically about you.</p>
       <p>6.1.8. We will give third party providers  who supply services to us, or who process information on our behalf, incidental  access to your information but will always take steps to ensure their security  measures are adequate to protect your information.</p>
       <p>6.1.9. We will disclose your information to  enforcement authorities if asked to do so, or to a third party in the context  of actual or threatened legal proceedings or if otherwise required to do so by  law.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p style="margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
       <h4 style="margin-top:0;">7. Your rights</h4>
       <p>7.1. You have a right to rectify any errors  in information we hold about you, and to change or correct any details you have  already given us. Please inform us about changes to your details so that we can  keep our records accurate and up-to-date. If you think we need to correct some  information we hold on you, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@sagepay.com">support@sagepay.com</a> or write to  our Data Protection Compliance Officer at the registered office address given  above.</p>
       <p>7.2. You also have a right to be removed  from any mailing list we hold at any time. To do this please email us at <a href="mailto:support@sagepay.com">support@sagepay.com</a>,  or write to our Marketing Manager or Data Protection Compliance Officer at the  registered office address given above.</p>
       <p>7.3. You have a right to see a copy of the  information we hold about you on payment of a statutory fee, which is currently  £10. Before we agree to this, you must provide us with sufficient evidence of  your identity and sufficient details of the information you wish to see to  enable us to locate it.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p style="margin-bottom:0;">&nbsp;</p>
       <h4 style="margin-top:0;">8. Transfers outside Europe</h4>
       <p>8.1. We are obliged to satisfy ourselves  before transferring your information to a country outside the EEA that it  provides adequate protection for your data protection rights.
