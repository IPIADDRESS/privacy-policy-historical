This Site is operated by or on behalf of a company within a group of affiliated companies collectively referred to as “The Sage </p>
<p>Companies” with each such affiliated company being directly or indirectly wholly owned by The Sage Group plc. (“The Sage Group”). At </p>
<p>Sage user privacy is important to us. We want you to feel confident visiting our Web sites and using our products. This Privacy </p>
<p>Statement outlines the privacy practices regarding information collected by Sage at this Web site and other Sage Web sites that link </p>
<p>to this Privacy Statement (the "Sites") and will tell you, as of the "Last Revised" date set forth at the end of this Privacy </p>
<p>Statement, what information Sage collects at the Sites, how we use that information, what choices you have concerning how such </p>
<p>information is used and how we protect your information. We encourage you to read our Privacy Statement so that you will understand </p>
<p>both our commitment to you and your privacy and how you can participate in that commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Public Forums.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Please remember that any information (including personal and business information) that you submit, post or otherwise </p>
<p>reveal in a public forum (such as a bulletin board, chat room, blog or product discussion forum) is not subject to this Privacy </p>
<p>Statement, will be seen by third parties not related to Sage and may be used by them or Sage to contact you for any purpose.</p>
<p>
Statement Regarding Children. Sage's products and services are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. As such, the </p>

<p>
<strong>Business Information Collection and Use By Sage</strong>
</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>
<br>
Sage collects the Business Information necessary to enable us to respond to your requests for our products and services and to send </p>
<p>you information regarding our products and services from time to time. Since most of the users of our products and Sites are doing so </p>
<p>in their capacity as employees or companies, most Business Information we collect will be in that capacity (rather than information </p>
<p>about you individually, such as your personal tastes, etc.). For these purposes, we have defined "Business Information" as any </p>
<p>information that identifies or may identify a company or an individual contact at a company or that allows others to contact a company </p>
<p>or an individual contact at a company. When you visit the Sites, you may be asked to submit information such as e-mail address, </p>
<p>company name, address, phone number, your product version and/or areas of interest. We may also ask you where you heard about our </p>
<p>company or products, or for other information that will help us understand more about your needs or help us process your requests for </p>
<p>information. In addition, we collect credit card and related payment information when you order products, services or support plans </p>
<p>online. Our information collection and use practices are described in more detail below.</p>
<p>
<strong>Product Registration.</strong>
</p>
<p>
You may be asked, on behalf of your company, to complete registration/activation form(s) on the Sites or from </p>
<p>within the products, with contact information for use by Sage in accordance with this policy. Registration or activation information </p>
<p>may include the name of your company, contact information, product information, customer ID, network and operating system, and other </p>
<p>relevant information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Customer Profile.</strong>
</p>
<p>
We also collect Business Information when you create a customer profile or Passport account on some of the Sites, </p>
<p>which is required in order to access certain areas of the Sites, purchase support plans and products, to obtain software downloads and </p>
<p>certain online support services and to request information from us about our products and services.. This information includes company </p>
<p>name and contact information and other information about your company (for example, size, revenue, and number of employees), the </p>
<p>products you may have licensed and other non-Sage products you may currently use. We use this information in accordance with this </p>
<p>policy to identify you, process your requests and administer your Sage account(s).</p>
<p>
<strong>Support.</strong>
</p>
<p>
We offer certain limited online support services at the Sites. If you access online support on any of the Sites, you may be </p>
<p>asked for information such as customer ID, product name, product version and other information to help us determine what the technical </p>
<p>issues are and how best to help you resolve them. In addition, certain products allow you to submit support-related questions directly </p>
<p>from the product. If you access online support services from a product, information about your network, operating system, printer, </p>
<p>data and program path, product type, version, customer ID, the product's technical support information sheet, product serial number </p>
<p>and other similar information will be automatically pre-populated for submission to our customer support representatives to assist </p>
<p>them in answering your questions.</p>
<p>
<strong>Newsletters.</strong>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;When you subscribe or sign up to receive newsletters published or offered via the Sites, we will ask you for information </p>
<p>necessary to enable us to process your request and to send you information regarding our products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong>
</p>
<p>
We also use Cookies to enhance the user experience, deliver personalized content and collect information about the use of the </p>
<p>Sites. "Cookies" are small computer files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow us to statistically monitor </p>
<p>how many people are using the Sites and for what purposes, how often someone visits the Sites and the length of their stay. This </p>
<p>information helps us dynamically generate advertising and information specifically designed for your interests. We also use Cookies to </p>
<p>prevent you from having to re-enter your identification and password information each time you visit our Sites. Cookies are not </p>
<p>designed to retrieve personal or business data from your hard drive, your e-mail or any other personal information. Most browsers are </p>
<p>initially set to accept Cookies, but users can change the setting to refuse Cookies or to be alerted when Cookies are being sent. </p>
<p>Although refusal of Cookies will not interfere with the ability to interact with most of the Sites, you will need to accept Cookies in </p>
<p>order to access information and use certain functions. For example, Cookies are required to be accepted for access to our Web-based </p>
<p>services or desktop products with online features. The Cookies are renewed each time a user logs on to one of the Sites that uses </p>
<p>Cookies.
</p>
<p>

<p>
<br>
<strong>Online Product /Account Application.</strong>

<p>information. This information is used to process your enrollment request and, if approved, to set up and administer your account </p>
<p>
<strong>Web-based Services.</strong>
</p>
<p>
In connection with certain of our Web-based services we collect certain additional information, including IP </p>
<p>address, browser, connection speed, domain, referring URL and other environment-related information to enable us to provide a secure </p>
<p>environment for the use of the services, to pre-populate forms and calculate aggregate statistical information about the customers </p>
<p>using these services. </p>

<p>
<strong>Other Sage Company Products &amp; Services</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Your Business Information may be provided to one or more other Sage Companies to enable them </p>
<p>to market products and services to you. In that case, the use of your Business Information would be governed by that Sage Company's </p>
<p>privacy policy. </p>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Products.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Sage may also use your Business Information to inform you of special discounts or offers from other companies we </p>
<p>have carefully selected and whose products and services may be of interest to you. </p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Your Business Information</strong>
</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>

<br>
From time to time, Sage may be required to release Business Information: 1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, </p>
<p>regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; 2) to enforce or apply the terms of any of our service or license agreements; or </p>
<p>3) in special cases, such as protecting the rights, property or safety of Sage, our customers or others. We may also provide Business </p>

<p>name, address, e-mail address, credit card information and customer ID) directly from you and use of that information and other </p>
<p>information provided by you to third parties is not governed by this policy even though those Partners and government agencies may </p>
<p>share such information with Sage.</p>

<p>support, solely at your request and with your permission; (2) on a limited-access basis to install updates, produce regular backups or </p>
<p>restore data from backups at your request (3) where the inherent purpose of the product or service requires Sage to provide the </p>
<p>Product Data or Services Data to a third party on your behalf (for example where Sage makes tax filings on your behalf or initiates </p>
<p>bank transfers on your behalf) and, (4) unless you opt-out, to utilize Aggregate Information derived from Product Data and Services </p>
<p>Data to help us improve our products and services and in developing additional offerings. Sage will not provide your Product Data or </p>
<p>Services Data to any third party or permit any third party to access your Product Data or Services Data, except by your permission or </p>
<p>to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order. In addition, if at any </p>
<p>time you decide to discontinue your use of the applicable service, your Services Data will be destroyed and removed from all servers </p>
<p>according to terms set forth in your Service Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>Business Transfers.</strong>
</p>
<p>
In the event that all or a portion of Sage or any other Sage Company (or the assets of one of those entities), is </p>
<p>bought or sold, Business Information will likely be included among the transferred business assets, but such information remains </p>
<p>subject to this Privacy Statement or a Privacy Statement substantially similar to this privacy statement.</p>
<p>
<strong>How Sage Protects Your Privacy Internally</strong>
</p>
<p>
Sage wants your Business Information to remain as secure as reasonably possible. We combine industry-standard technical safeguards </p>
<p>with a code of conduct for those employees that are permitted to access our customers' Business Information. When you purchase a </p>
<p>product or service online, Sage uses SSL encryption to encrypt your credit card information before it is sent to us in order to ensure </p>
<p>the integrity and privacy of the credit card information that you provide to us via the Internet.</p>
<p>
Many of our Web-based services are hosted on servers that are co-located at a third party facility with whom we have a contract </p>
<p>providing for security measures. For example, hosted Services Data is submitted via SSL encryption and stored on a server equipped </p>
<p>with industry standard firewalls.</p>
<p>
Only authorized Sage employees, agents or independent contractors are permitted to access your Business Information, Product Data or </p>
<p>Web Services Data. Those employees that violate our Privacy Statement are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including </p>
<p>termination. Despite these security measures, Sage does not represent or warrant that Business Information will be protected against loss, misuse, </p>
<p>attacks, or alteration by third parties.</p>
<p>
<strong>Your Privacy Choices</strong>
</p>
<p>
Occasionally, a Sage business unit may send you communications to provide you with information or promotions relating to products and </p>
<p>services that may be of interest to you, including notification of important product issues and updates. You may opt out of receiving </p>
<p>these communications as indicated below. However, please note that any election not to receive future communications applies only to </p>
<p>promotional messages of the particular Sage business unit and you may receive promotional messages from other Sage business units </p>
<p>until you make an opt out request with that business unit as indicated below. Additionally, we may still send you relationship or </p>
<p>transactional messages in order to notify you of important product issues and updates, such as tax and other compliance-related </p>
<p>matters, for the renewal of existing subscription services, to resolve specific questions or requests made by you via phone, fax, </p>
<p>e-mail or the Web and in response to any activity completed on any of the Sites, including but not limited to, registration, ordering, </p>
<p>downloads and requests for information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Sage E-Mail Promotions.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Each e-mail we send will contain instructions on how to unsubscribe in the event that you do not wish to </p>
<p>receive future promotional e-mails from the Sage business unit that sent you the e-mail promotion. If you choose to opt-out of </p>
<p>receiving promotional e-mail communications from any Sage business unit, we may still periodically communicate with you via mail and </p>
<p>telephone. Please allow 10 business days to be removed from the promotional e-mail list of a Sage business unit.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party E-Mail Promotions.</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you access and/or use any of the other Sage Companies' services or our Partner's services from a </p>
<p>link on the Sites, a Sage/Partner co-branded site or by any other means, any information you reveal in connection with such service is </p>
<p>submitted to that other Sage Company or to our Partner and is not subject to this Privacy Statement. You should consult the privacy </p>
<p>policy of any other Sage Company, Partner or third-party site with respect to its treatment of any information that you may reveal in </p>
<p>connection with such service.</p>
<p>
<strong>Correcting or Updating Your Business Information and Contacting Sage</strong>
</p>
<p>
You can always update the Business Information that you have provided to us and/or change your preferences with respect to marketing </p>
<p>contacts from Sage by contacting the Sage business unit to which you provided your preferences. Please note that it may take up to 4 </p>
<p>weeks to be removed from the Sage business unit’s mail lists and 10 days to be removed from e-mail and phone lists.<br>
Linked Sites</p>
<p>
The Sites may contain links to third-party Web sites and resources (collectively, "Linked Sites"). These Linked Sites are provided </p>
<p>solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by Sage of the content on such Linked Sites. Sage makes no representations or </p>
<p>warranties regarding the correctness, accuracy, performance or quality of any content, software, service or application found at any </p>
<p>Linked Site. Sage is not responsible for the availability of the Linked Sites or the content or activities of such sites. If you </p>
<p>decide to access any Linked Site, you do so at your own risk. Your use of any Linked Site is subject to the policies, terms of use and </p>
<p>privacy policies of such Linked Site, if any.</p>
<p>
<strong>Consent to Transfer</strong>
</p>
<p>
Users located outside the United States who submit Business Information to Sage via the Sites should be aware that the information </p>
<p>they submit will be transferred to our servers located in the United States. Your submission of Business Information to us constitutes </p>
<p>your consent to this transfer. Although Sage will collect and use your Business Information only as stated in this Privacy Statement, </p>
<p>laws generally applicable to the protection of personal data in the United States may not be as stringent as those in some users' home </p>
<p>jurisdictions.</p>
<p>
<strong>Changes to this Privacy Statement</strong><br>
Sage may change this Privacy Statement at any time by posting the then current policy to the Sites. Your use of the Sites constitutes </p>
<p>acceptance of the provisions of this Privacy Statement and your continued usage after such changes are posted constitutes acceptance </p>
<p>of each revised Privacy Statement.</p>
