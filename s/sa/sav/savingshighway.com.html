PRIVACY POLICY</big><br>
      <br>
      </big><big>Information is collected on this website by
SavingsHighway, Inc. doing business as SavingsHighway.com, LLC.
("SavingsHighway" or "SH"). SavingsHighway is committed to protecting
your privacy and will use your personal information responsibly. Please
read below for detailed information about our privacy policy.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Information Collection and Use</span><br>
SavingsHighway.com (SH) is the owner of all information collected at
this site. We will not share or rent this personal information with or
to anyone else in any way that is different from what is disclosed to
you in this policy. We may collect information from several different
points on our website or the websites of SavingsHighway Independent
Member Representatives (IMRs), when you make a purchase from one of our
IMRs or have other interactions where personal data is provided.<br>
      <br>
At certain points in interactive communication with us, you might
provide us with personal information such as your name, address,
telephone number, and email address. Demographic personal information
such as income level, gender, and other personal information of yours
may be provided by you on an optional basis.<br>
      <br>
We may also gather online information regarding your purchases and
shopping activities on websites we host (such as those of
SavingsHighway IMRs) to improve the content, ease of use and shopping
experience on those websites and to improve our marketing and
promotions for our company overall and the websites in particular.<br>
      <br>
In addition, our web server may automatically collect the following
non-personally identifiable information:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * your Internet service provider's address,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * the referring URL and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * the information on the pages you access on our
site or on the sites of the SavingsHighway IMRs since we host those
websites.<br>
      <br>
Personal information that you provide to SavingsHighway will be used by
us for the purposes of enabling a SavingsHighway IMR or other
SavingsHighway Member or Independent Contractor contact you at your
request for the purposes of your becoming a SavingsHighway member,
customer or IMR. SavingsHighway may also use your personal information
to contact you to keep you informed of developments or opportunities in
relation to SavingsHighway, or any of its products or services.<br>
      <br>
We may also use information collected when you make a purchase on line
through a IMR Website or at a SavingsHighway show in order to process
your order or purchase, process credit card payments, provide warranty
service or advise you of promotions and SavingsHighway product news. We
may also send you emails with offers from marketing partners which have
products or service we believe might be of interest to you.<br>
      <br>
We do use third party companies to gather information and provide
services to us, for example in maintaining and organizing customer
information and conducting promotions, upgrading our Internet services,
sending communications and contacting our customers. Some of those
third parties will and do have access to the information which
customers, members and IMRs provide, including email addresses and
credit card information and they may also use cookies on behalf of
SavingsHighway.<br>
      <br>
We may also use third party providers to provide ads for SavingsHighway
products or services throughout the Internet. They may provide
anonymous information regarding your visits to a SavingsHighway website
(or that of a SavingsHighway IMR) and your interaction with the goods
and services which SavingsHighway provides. They may also use
information about your visits to SavingsHighway and other web sites to
target advertisements for goods or services. Your anonymous information
is collected through a pixel tab, a standard technology used at most
major consumer websites. This technology does not require the use or
collection of any personally identifiable information such as your name
or email address.<br>
      <br>
If you have any concerns regarding the use of your information or wish
to be removed from our e-mail list, please contact us through our free
online help desk at www.savingshighway.com/support.<br>
      <br>

We do not intend to collect any personal information from children
under the age of eighteen. If a parent or guardian of a child who has
provided us with such personal information would like the information
deleted from our records, he or she should contact us through our free

the child's personal information from our files.<br>
      <br>

child under the age of 13 has been collected at the Site, we will use
such information for the sole purpose of contacting a parent or
guardian of the child to obtain verifiable parental consent. If we

contacted a parent or guardian requests that we do not use or maintain
such information, we will make reasonable efforts to delete it from our
records. Upon request by a parent or guardian, SavingsHighway will
provide a description of the specific types of personal information
collected from a child who is under the age of 13.<br>
