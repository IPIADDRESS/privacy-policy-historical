              <p><strong>LAST UPDATED: OCTOBER 24, 2012</strong></p>
              
              <p>VillageVines Inc., d.b.a Savored ("VillageVines" or "Savored" or "we" or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy.

Your use of the Sites and the Services is governed by this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.</p>

              <h3>ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR SERVICES</h3>
              <p>This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Savored Sites and not to any other website or mobile site that you may be able to access from the Savored Sites (whether through an advertisement, service, or content link) or any website or mobile site of VillageVines' partners or our affiliates, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.</p>
              <p>While you may use some of the functionality of Savored without registration, many of the content and Services on the Sites require registration.  If you use our Sites without registering, the only information we collect will be Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons (please see Section 2).  If you choose to register with our Sites, we require you to submit certain Personal Information, which is information that personally identifies you, including, your first and last name, e-mail address, year of birth, username and password, telephone, credit card information and mailing address.

              <h4 style="font-weight:bold">Cookies</h4>
              <p>We use "cookies" to customize your experience on the Sites and, if you create a password, to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Sites.

Web beacons are tiny graphic image files embedded in a web page or email that provide a presence on the web page or email and send back to its home server information from the user's browser.  The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people open our emails, are using our Sites and Services, and selected affiliates', sponsors', and advertisers' sites and communications, and for what purposes.  Our web beacons are not used to track your activity outside of our Sites, or those of our affiliates' or sponsors'.  We do not link Non-Personal Information from web beacons to Personal Information without your permission, except in connection with our marketing, promotion, or similar initiatives alone or jointly with our business partners and affiliates.</p>

When a survey is sponsored by an affiliate or other third party, aggregate information of the survey results is reported to the sponsor.  Personal Information collected through market research will be used only by Savored, our affiliates, our service providers and contractors, and successors and assigns, and will not otherwise be given or sold to another third party without your consent or as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy.  We will not knowingly accept survey responses from or conduct interviews with any person under the age of 18.

If you have cookies disabled you may not be able to participate in some studies.  Cookies may be used to connect survey data with Savored site usage characteristics.  You will be notified when we would like to use cookies in this way and your consent will be requested for these cookies.</p>
              
              <h4 style="font-weight:bold">Business Partner Feedback</h4>
