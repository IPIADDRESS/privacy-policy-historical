<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Savings.com, Inc. (“Savings.com”, “us”, “our” or “we”) has developed this Privacy Policy which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on the website Savings.com which is owned and operated by Savings.com, and any other websites owned and operated by Savings.com, ( the “Site”). Each Site has adopted this Privacy Policy to the extent applicable. This Privacy Policy also applies to the use and disclosure of information collected when you download, install and use the Savings.com browser extensions and the services made available through those browser extensions (collectively, the “Browser Extensions”), or use any other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile applications or to those related to our social media pages or accounts (the Site, the Browser Extensions and other Savings.com interactive properties are collectively referred to herein as the “Savings.com Applications”). Savings.com provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use, continue to use the services provided by Savings.com and/or assessed through the Savings.com Applications (“Services”). This Privacy Policy applies to your use of (1) the Savings.com Applications (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise); (2) email or electronic catalogs and newsletters; and (3) any other means or applications in which you connect with us or our products and services. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Service and the Savings.com DealFinder License Agreement. Each time that you access or use Savings.com Applications or our Services you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the Terms of Service, and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the Savings.com Applications or Services.</p>
</div>
<h3>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
<h4>Connecting with the Savings.com Applications and Information Provided by You</h4>
<p><strong>Contacting Us.</strong> When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you about Savings.com using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p>
<p><strong>Registration Information.</strong> We will collect personal information from you if you register on our Site or voluntarily provide information about yourself in your profile (“Personal Information”). You do not have to register to use our Services, download our Browser Extensions or access coupons on our Site. Upon initial registration you will be asked to provide a user name and zip code so we can identity your locality by city and state (“Regional Location”), or more specific location for certain applications available on Savings.com Applications, as more clearly spelled out in this policy (“Geolocation”), to serve you offers that are suited to you and where you live or are currently located. Your user name will be disclosed on all our public forums as well as your Regional Location which will be reflected by the zip code that you provide. You will have an opportunity to confirm or change your General Location without use of a zip code during the registration process. You will also have the opportunity to indicate your interests by answering questions about the types of goods and services you are interested in and your favorite brands and stores so that we can better serve you savings and offers for exactly what interests you (“Interests”). Savings.com reserves the right to deny, in its sole discretion, any user access to the Savings.com Applications or Services without notice for any or no reason.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys and Promotions.</strong> From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys or contests or sweepstakes. Participation in these surveys, contests or sweepstakes is completely voluntary so you and other users have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information and other information as required by the official rules may be used to notify the winners and award prizes and file winners information as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purpose(s) of the survey, including the monitoring or improvement of the use and satisfaction of Savings.com Applications.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong> You may be given the option to link your Facebook account so that you can comment on the Savings.com Applications or take advantage of other features of the Savings.com Applications. When you comment on the Savings.com Applications using your Facebook username and password and clicking “allow” on the Facebook permission authorization screen, you give us permission to capture, store, use and display your Facebook user ID, your basic Facebook profile information and any other information from your Facebook profile that you specifically allow us to access. The authentication of your Facebook login credentials are conducted solely through Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Platforms.</strong> If you use Facebook or other social media platforms or applications to interact with Savings.com Applications, the social media platform(s) may have a specific privacy statement that governs the use of Personal Information related to that platform or application. In addition, we use Janrain to support our social network platforms and if you provide permission on any particular site, information from your social networking accounts may be forwarded to us. If you wish more information about how your information can be transferred to us from Janrain visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.janrain.com/janrain-privacy-statement/">http://www.janrain.com/janrain-privacy-statement/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Geolocation Services.</strong> It is possible that we may ask you if you wish us to collect your Geolocation in order to offer you real-time deals nearby and will maintain information about your geolocation to facilitate your serving such real time deals to you. In addition, when you have the geolocation software running on your mobile phone, computer or other device, we may collect that information as controlled by your privacy settings on those Devices. We will not share your exact Geolocation or use your exact Geolocation for any other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>User Generated Content.</strong> The Services may contain review or chat areas and/or other message, communication or other mechanisms designed to enable you to communicate with others or to post content on the Site (the “Interactive Services”). Please remember that any information you disclose while participating with the Interactive Services becomes public information, and is subject to redistribution by, Savings.com and all others viewing the information. You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. There is no expectation of privacy when posting, or otherwise participating on the Interactive Services. If you post content, such as messages, reviews or photos, please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered users or visitors to that Savings.com Application or Communication Service and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Interactive Services. We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate. Please review our Terms of Service for more information regarding your appropriate use of these Interactive Services.</p>
<p><span id="info-collected"><strong>Information Collected Through Technology.</strong></span> In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Savings.com Applications, including without limitation, the URL that referred you to the Savings.com Applications (“Affiliate Referral Urls”) or other marketing or distribution sources, all of the areas within the Savings.com Applications that you visit, when you view, purchase, or redeem coupons or accept offers accessed through our Services, the comments you make through our Interactive Services, and how you otherwise use our Services and which offers are of interest to you (“Usage Information”). We may use the Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Savings.com Applications. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer or other device used to access the Savings.com Applications (any, a “Device”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the Device used to access the Savings.com Applications, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. When you download and use our Brower Extensions we will also collect information from our affiliates and our merchants based upon the sites you visit, the coupons you redeem, and other web sites you may have visited or Affiliate Referral Urls and will store those Affiliate Referral Urls and a list of our merchants who provide savings through our Services on your Device to assist us in providing you with coupons and savings that are of interest to you. We will also collect Location information or Geolocation information to ensure we serve you offers and coupons for products and services available to you in your location. Whenever we associate Usage Information, Location information, Geolocation information or a Device Identifier with personally identifiable information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>A few of the tracking technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following</p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px;">
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Savings.com Applications. We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Savings.com Applications. Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Site and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Site easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages, merchant sites and redemption of coupons. When you click on a coupon or an offer on the “Savings.com Applications an affiliate cookie will be set on your hard drive to track your use and redemption of the coupon or offer. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Savings.com Applications may not function properly.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Savings.com Applications, to monitor how users navigate the Savings.com Applications, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<p><strong>Web Logs.</strong> Like most standard website servers, we log Device Identifiers and the operating system of your computer and may track your movement and redemption within the Savings.com Applications, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Savings.com Applications. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Savings.com Applications, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information and track traffic and sales to our partner merchants. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Information You Provide About a Third Party.</strong> If you send someone else a communication from the Savings.com Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. If that person becomes a customer or registers with us, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other customers or registered users. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Savings.com Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>
