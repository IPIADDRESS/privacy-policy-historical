  <br>
This Privacy Policy explains our information practices for the SavedHistory.com website which is owned and controlled by SH Spb Inc. We want you to understand how we may use your information, before you provide it.

<br>
<strong>Personal Information :</strong><br>
<br>
You can visit SavedHistory.com on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. However, you may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information such as your name and address or e-mail ID so we may correspond with you, or provide you with subscription or service opportunities. If you tell us that you do not want us to use information you provide to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, we will assume that you have their prior permission to do so.<br>
<br>

The following paragraphs describe in more detail how we may use the information you provide to us on the SavedHistory.com site and with whom we may share it. Depending on the part of the SavedHistory.com site you are visiting, one or more of the following paragraphs may apply - <br>
<br>

  <br>
  <strong>Links to Other Websites :</strong><br>
  <br>
In some cases, when you are seeking further information about a person you are searching, you may see links or advertisements about information and data available to you through other websites. For example, if you find a site  through the SavedHistory.com site, you may be able to gather more detailed information such as a phone number or address, subject to certain terms and conditions. You should carefully review the privacy and personal information policies of any advertised or linked websites before providing any personal information or purchasing any product or service from them.

<strong>Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Web Technologies :</strong><br>

We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to the SavedHistory.com site to help us provide better customer service.
