                As your visits to the Site will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the

            <li><strong>General</strong><br>
                This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is designed to inform you about the type
                of information that Saveology ("Company", "we," "our" or "us") may gather about
                or collect from you in connection with your use of Saveology.com (this "Site"). It
                also is intended to explain the conditions under which we use and disclose that
                information, and your rights in relation to that information. </li>
            <li><strong>Children</strong><br>
                This Site is not intended for children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly
                collect personal information from children under 18. </li>
            <li><strong>Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
                We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying
                Information from you. <strong>"Non–Personally–Identifying Information" </strong>
                is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly
                associated with a specific person or entity. <strong>"Personally–Identifying Information,"
                </strong>by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without
                more, can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.

                                Like most site operators, we gather from you Non-Personally-Identifying Information
                                of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.
                                That information includes your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, operating system
                                and browser type, and the locations of the web pages that you view right before
                                arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.</li>

                                A <strong>"Web Cookie" </strong>is a string of information that a site stores on
                                your computer, and that your browser provides to this Site each time you submit
                                a query to this site. We use Web Cookies to track the pages that you visit during
                                each Site session, both to help us improve your experiences with this Site and to
                                help us understand how this Site is being used.

                                IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR

                                THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF
                                WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING

                                In order to enhance your experience when you visit our website, we participate in
                                the Google Interest-based Advertising Program (the "Program") to insure that the
                                advertisements on our website correspond to your interests. We do this by working
                                with Google and other Program participants who, like us, place ads on our website
                                and those of other Program Participants. We then share the information we collect
                                using cookies placed in your browser in order to provide you with targeted advertising
                                when you visit our websites. You may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting
                                the Google Advertising Opt Out Page: http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</li>
                            <li><strong><em>Web Beacons</em></strong><br>
                                A <strong>"Web Beacon" </strong>is an object that is embedded in a web page. It
                                is usually invisible to you but allows site operators to check whether you have
                                viewed a particular web page or email communication. We may occasionally place Web
                                Beacons on pages of this Site.
                                <br>
                                You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining
                                all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is
                                tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.

                    <li><strong><em>Use of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</em></strong><br>
                        We analyze Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from you to help us better
                        understand how this Site is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage,
                        we are able to better design this Site to improve your experiences, both in terms
                        of content and ease of use. We link information gathered using Web Cookies and Web
                        Beacons to Personally-Identifying Information.</li>

                        From time to time, we may also release the Non–Personally–Identifying Information
                        gathered from you in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in
                        the usage of this Site. </li>

                As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be
                directly associated with a specific person or entity. We will only collect Personally-Identifying
                Information that you knowingly submit to us. We will not disclose Personally-Identifying
                Information to third parties, except under the limited circumstances described below.

                            neither people nor security systems are foolproof. Therefore, while we use reasonable
                            efforts to protect your Personally-Identifying Information, we cannot guarantee
                            its absolute security. </li>

                            will be subject to the terms of the promotion, not this Privacy Policy. You will
                            be given the option to consent to the use of your Personally-Identifying Information
                            at the time you sign up for the promotion. However, your participation in the promotion
                            will not be conditioned on the consent to use your Personally-Identifying Information
                            for purposes unrelated to the promotion. </li>

                to Personally-Identifying Information and Non-Personally-Identifying Information
                that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect
                for themselves. We do not control third-party sites that may be accessible through
