                  PRIVACY POLICY</p>
              <p>
                  Please note that from time to time we may review and modify our Privacy Policy.
                   As your visits to the Site will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the
                   time of your visit, please review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you
                   are aware of any modifications.
               </p>
              <p>
                  This policy is effective as of and was last updated on April 1, 2010</p>
              <p>
                  <strong>1. General.</strong><br>
                  This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to inform you about the type
                   of information that Saveology (“Saveology”, “we,” “our” or “us”) may gather about or collect
                   from you in connection with your use of Saveology.com (this “Site”). It also is intended
                   to explain the conditions under which we use and disclose that information, and
                   your rights in relation to that information.
               </p>
              <p>
                  <strong>2. Children</strong><br>
                  This Site is not intended for children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly
                   collect personal information from children under 18.
               </p>
              <p>
                  <strong>3. Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
                  We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying
                   Information from you. “Non–Personally–Identifying Information” is information that,
                   without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a
                   specific person or entity. “Personally–Identifying Information,” by contrast, is
                   information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly
                   associated with a specific person or entity.</p>
              <p class="indent">
                  <strong>A. Gathering Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>
              <p class="indent2">
                  <strong>(i) Web Browsers</strong><br>
                  Like most site operators, we gather from you Non-Personally-Identifying Information
                   of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.
                   That information includes your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, operating system
                   and browser type, and the locations of the web pages that you view right before
                   arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.</p>
              <p class="indent2">
                  <strong>(ii) Web Cookies</strong><br>
                  A “Web Cookie” is a string of information that a site stores on your computer, and
                   that your browser provides to this Site each time you submit a query to this site.
                   We use Web Cookies to track the pages that you visit during each Site session, both
                   to help us improve your experiences with this Site and to help us understand how
                   this Site is being used.
               </p>
              <p>
                  IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR
                    BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THIS SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING
                   THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF
                   WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING
                   LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p>
              <p class="indent2">
                  <strong>(iii) Web Beacons</strong><br>
                  A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page. It is usually invisible
                   to you but allows site operators to check whether you have viewed a particular web
                   page or email communication. We may occasionally place Web Beacons on pages of this
                   Site. You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they may be rendered ineffective
                   by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time
                   a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual
                   basis.

                  <strong>B. Use of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong>
                  <br>
                  We analyze Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from you to help us better
                   understand how this Site is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage,
                    we are able to better design this Site to improve your experiences, both in terms
                   of content and ease of use.</p>
              <p class="indent">
                  <strong>C. Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
                  From time to time, we may also release the Non–Personally–Identifying Information
                   gathered from you in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in
                   the usage of this Site.</p>
              <p>
                  <strong>4. Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personally–Identifying Information</strong><br>
                  As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be
                   directly associated with a specific person or entity. We will only collect Personally-Identifying
                   Information that you knowingly submit to us. We will not disclose Personally-Identifying
                   Information to third parties unless we obtain your permission to do so at the time
                   we collect it, except under the limited circumstances described below.

                      When you register with this Site, you may be asked to disclose Personally–Identifying
                       Information. You may also choose to submit Personally-Identifying Information to
                       us when you send us an email. We collect only the information necessary to process
                       your credit card payment and fulfill your requests. You acknowledge and agree that
                       we may use and store information about you in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
                       We may also process and store your Personal Information on a server located outside
                       of your jurisdiction. By providing your Personal Information to us, you consent
                       to the transfer of your information across national boundaries. If you do not consent
                       to such transfer as well as the processing and storage of your Personal Information
                       outside your jurisdiction, you should not provide Personal Information to us.

                       manage online payments as well as to collect and store the Personal Information
                       you provide to us. When you order products or services or provide us with information,
                       you will be transferred to a secure server where this information is stored and
                       managed. All of the Personal Information you provide is encrypted before it is sent
                       to us.</p>

                       with a survey will be used only in relation to that survey, and will be disclosed
                       to third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy only in non-personally-identifying,
                       aggregated form.</p>

                      We disclose Personally–Identifying Information if: (1) required to do so by law,
                       or in response to a subpoena or court order; (2) we believe in our sole discretion
                       that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud, to protect our
                        property or other rights, or the rights of other users, third parties or the public
                       at large; or (3) we believe that you have abused the Site by using it to attack
                       other systems or to gain unauthorized access to any other system, to engage in spamming

                       to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy
                       or other transfer of all or a portion of our assets. Other than to the extent ordered

                       Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if
                       you are given notice of that transfer. Personally-Identifying Information submitted
                       or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted
                       by the successor organization.

                       neither people nor security systems are foolproof. Therefore, while we use reasonable

                       will be subject to the terms of the promotion, not this Privacy Policy. You will
                       be given the option to consent to the use of your Personally-Identifying Information
                       at the time you sign up for the promotion. However, your participation in the promotion
                       will not be conditioned on the consent to use your Personally-Identifying Information
                       for purposes unrelated to the promotion.
