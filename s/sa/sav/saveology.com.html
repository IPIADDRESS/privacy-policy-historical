 <p><strong>1. General</strong><br>
   This privacy policy (“Privacy  Policy”) is designed to inform you about the type of information that Saveology.com&nbsp; (“Saveology”, “we,” “our” or “us”) may gather  about or collect from you in connection with your use of this site (this  “Site”).&nbsp; It also is intended to explain  the conditions under which we use and disclose that information, and your rights  in relation to that information.<br>
   <br>
   The procedures for modifying or changing this Privacy Policy  in the future are discussed in Section 6.</p>
 <p><strong>2. Children</strong><br>
   This Site is not intended for  children under 18 years of age.&nbsp; We do  not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
 <p><strong>3. Gathering, Use and  Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information<br>
   </strong>We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and  Personally-Identifying Information from you.&nbsp;  “<strong>Non–Personally–Identifying  Information</strong>” is information that, without the aid of additional  information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or  entity.&nbsp; “<strong>Personally–Identifying Information</strong>,” by contrast, is information  such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated  with a specific person or entity.<br>
   <br>
<br>
   <strong><em>A. Gathering Non-Personally-Identifying  Information</em></strong><br>
   <strong><em>(i)&nbsp;Web  Browsers</em></strong><br>
   Like most site operators, we  gather from you Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that web  browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.&nbsp; That information includes your Internet  Protocol (“<strong>IP</strong>”) address, operating  system and browser type, and the locations of the web pages that you view right  before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.<strong></strong><br>
   <br>
   <strong><em>(ii) Web  Cookies</em></strong><br>
   A “<strong>Web Cookie</strong>” is a string of information that a site stores on your  computer, and that your browser provides to this Site each time you submit a  query to this site.&nbsp; We use Web Cookies  to track the pages that you visit during each Site session, both to help us  improve your experiences with this Site to help us understand how this Site is  being used.&nbsp; <br>
   <br>
   IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB  COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB  COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THIS SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN  FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES.  IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS  OF FUNCTIONALITY. <br>
   <br>
   <strong><em>(iii) Web  Beacons</em></strong><br>
   A “<strong>Web Beacon</strong>” is an object that is embedded in a web page.&nbsp; It is usually invisible to you but allows  site operators to check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email  communication.&nbsp; We may occasionally place  Web Beacons on pages of this Site.<br>
   <br>
   You may not decline Web Beacons.&nbsp;  However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or  modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and  permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.&nbsp; <br>
   <strong><em><br>
   B. Use  of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</em></strong><br>
   We analyze  Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from you to help us better  understand how this Site is being used.&nbsp;  By identifying patterns and trends in usage, we are able to better  design this Site to improve your experiences, both in terms of content and ease  of use.&nbsp; We link information gathered  using Web Cookies and Web Beacons to Personally-Identifying Information.<strong></strong><br>
   <br>
   <em><strong>C. Disclosure  of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong></em><br>
   From time to time, we may also  release the Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from you in the  aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of this Site.<br>
   <br>
   <strong>4. Collection, Use and  Disclosure of Personally–Identifying Information</strong><br>
   As defined  above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly  associated with a specific person or entity.&nbsp;  We will only collect Personally-Identifying Information that you  knowingly submit to us.&nbsp; We will not  disclose Personally-Identifying Information to third parties unless we obtain  your permission to do so at the time we collect it, except as set forth below:<br>
   <br>
   <strong><em>A. Registration and Other Information  Provided to Us</em></strong><br>
   When you register with this Site, you may be asked to disclose  Personally–Identifying Information.&nbsp; You  may also choose to submit Personally-Identifying Information to us when you  send us an email.&nbsp; <strong></strong><br>
   <br>
   <strong><em>B. </em><em>Surveys</em></strong><br>
   From time to time, we may also  ask you to participate in surveys designed to help us improve this Site.&nbsp; Any Personally-Identifying Information  provided to us in connection with a survey will be used only in relation to  that survey, and will be disclosed to third parties not bound by this Privacy  Policy only in non-personally-identifying, aggregated form.</p>
 <p><strong><em>C.&nbsp;Other Disclosures</em></strong><br>
   Notwithstanding any other  provision in this Privacy Policy, we will disclose Personally-Identifying  Information in the following limited circumstances:<br>
   <strong><em><br>
   (i) Employees  and Third Party Processors</em></strong><br>
   We will disclose  Personally–Identifying Information to our employees, contractors, affiliates,  vendors and suppliers who process Personally–Identifying Information on our  behalf or participate with us in the provision or operation of this Site.&nbsp; <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
   <strong><em>(ii) By  Law, to Protect Rights and to Comply with Our Policies</em></strong><br>
   We disclose  Personally–Identifying Information if:&nbsp;  (1) required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena or court  order; (2) we believe in our sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably  necessary to protect against fraud, to protect our property or other rights, or  the rights of other users, third parties or the public at large; or (3) we  believe that you have abused the service by using it to attack other systems or  to gain unauthorized access to any other system, to engage in spamming or  otherwise to violate applicable laws.<br>
   <em><strong><br>
   (</strong></em><strong><em>iii) Business  Transfers; Bankruptcy</em></strong><br>
   We reserve the right to transfer all Personally-Identifying  Information in our possession to a successor organization in the event of a  merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our  assets.&nbsp; Other than to the extent ordered  by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personally–Identifying  Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy  if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and you affirmatively opt-in  to accept it.&nbsp; Personally-Identifying  Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to  a new privacy policy adopted by the successor organization.&nbsp; </p>
 <p><strong><em>(iv) Marketing</em></strong><br>
   We may contact you <strong>by  email or telephone</strong> about products and services that we think may be of  interest to you.&nbsp; If you wish to opt out  of receiving marketing emails from us, please follow the instructions at the  bottom of each email.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>D. Security</em></strong><br>
  We  take reasonable precautions to protect the security of your information.  However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof.&nbsp; Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to  protect your Personally-Identifying Information, we cannot guarantee its  absolute security.</p>
<p align="left"><em><strong>E. Contests,  Giveaways and other Promotions</strong></em><br>
  From time to time, we may offer  Site users the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways and other promotions.&nbsp; Any information submitted in connection with  promotions will be subject to the terms of the promotion, not this Privacy  Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will be given the option to  consent to the use of your Personally-Identifying Information at the time you  sign up for the promotion.&nbsp; You will not  be required to participate in any promotion.</p>
 <p><strong>5.  Collection and Use of Information by  Third Parties Not Covered By This Agreement</strong><br>
   Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy  Policy with respect to Personally-Identifying Information and  Non-Personally-Identifying Information that you provide directly to those third  parties or that those third parties collect for themselves.&nbsp; We do not control third-party sites that may  be accessible through this Site.&nbsp; Thus,  this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to third party sites  or gathered by the third parties that operate them.&nbsp; Before visiting a third party site, whether  by means of a link on this Site or otherwise, and before providing any  Personally-Identifying Information to any third party, you should inform  yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party  responsible for that site, and should take those steps necessary to, in your  discretion, protect their privacy.&nbsp; </p>
 <p><strong>6.  Privacy Policy Changes</strong><br>
   Because of changes in  technology and the growth and development of our business or for other reasons,  we may need to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will alert you by email if this policy is  revised (if you have given us your email address) and will post a copy of the  new policy with its effective date on this Site.&nbsp; It is therefore important that you register  with this Site and notify us if you change email addresses.&nbsp; If you do not provide us with a current email  address, you should regularly review this policy to ensure that you are  informed of any changes.&nbsp; <br>
   <br>
   Unless we obtain your express  consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected  after the time it takes effect, and not to information collected under any  earlier Privacy Policy.&nbsp; </p>
This policy is effective as of and was last  updated on March 5, 2009.<br>
