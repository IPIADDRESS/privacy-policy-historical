        SAVEOLOGY DAILY DEALS - PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p>
        <em>Please note that from time to time we may review and modify our Privacy Policy.
            As your visits to the Site will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the
            time of your visit, please review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you
            are aware of any modifications. </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        This policy is effective as of and was last updated on May 13, 2011.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>1. General</strong><br>
        This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to inform you about the type
        of information that SaveologyDEALS, LLC (“Company”, “we,” “our” or “us”) may gather
        about or collect from you in connection with your use of www.Saveology.com (the
        “Site”). It also is intended to explain the conditions under which we use and disclose
        that information, and your rights in relation to that information.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>2. Children</strong><br>
        This Site is not intended for persons under eighteen (18) years of age. We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from persons under eighteen.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3. Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
        We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying
        Information from you. “<strong>Non–Personally–Identifying Information</strong>”
        is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly
        associated with a specific person or entity. “<strong>Personally–Identifying Information,</strong>”
        by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more,
        can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>A. Gathering Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong><em><strong><br>
            <br>
            (i) Web Browsers</strong></em><br>
        Like most site operators, we gather from you Non-Personally-Identifying Information
        of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.
        That information includes your Internet Protocol (“<strong>IP</strong>”) address,
        operating system and browser type, and the locations of the web pages that you view
        right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.<br>
        <strong>
            <br>
            <em>(ii) Web Cookies</em></strong><br>
        A “<strong>Web Cookie</strong>” is a string of information that a site stores on
        your computer, and that your browser provides to this Site each time you submit
        a query to this site. We use Web Cookies to track the pages that you visit during
        each Site session, both to help us improve your experiences with this Site and to
        help us understand how this Site is being used.
        <br>
        IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR
        BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THIS SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING
        THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF
        WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING
        LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.
        <br>
        <strong>
            <br>
            <em>(iii) Google Interest Based Advertising Program</em></strong><br>
        In order to enhance your experience when you visit our website, we participate in
        the Google Interest-based Advertising Program (the “Program”) to insure that the
        advertisements on our website correspond to your interests. We do this by working
        with Google and other Program participants who, like us, place ads on our website
        and those of other Program Participants. We then share the information we collect
        using cookies placed in your browser in order to provide you with targeted advertising
        when you visit our websites. You may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting
        the Google Advertising Opt Out Page: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a></p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>(iv) Web Beacons</em></strong><br>
        A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page. It is usually invisible
        to you but allows site operators to check whether you have viewed a particular web
        page or email communication. We may occasionally place Web Beacons on pages of this
        Site.</p>
    <p>
        You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining
        all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is
        tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>B. Use of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
        We analyze Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from you to help us better
        understand how this Site is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage,
        we are able to better design this Site to improve your experiences, both in terms
        of content and ease of use. We link information gathered using Web Cookies and Web
        Beacons to Personally-Identifying Information.
        <br>
        <strong>
            <br>
            C. Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
        From time to time, we may also release the Non–Personally–Identifying Information
        gathered from you in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in
        the usage of this Site.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>4. Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personally–Identifying Information</strong><br>
        As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be
        directly associated with a specific person or entity. We will only collect Personally-Identifying
        Information that you knowingly submit to us. We will not disclose Personally-Identifying
        Information to third parties, except under the limited circumstances described below.<br>
