<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>We may supplement what we know about you with information that is available to the public.</u> For example, in order to ensure that our communication with you is relevant and tailored to your background and interests, we may collect information about you from publicly-available sources either directly or through third-party subscription services or service providers.

<li>We <em>do not</em> use cookies to collect this type of information. All online financial transactions will be encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security).</li>
</ul><p>We may also collect and process information about your interactions with us, including details about our contacts with you through email, SMS, post, on the phone or in person (i.e., the date, time, and method of contact), details about donations you make to us, events or activities that you register for or attend and any other support you provide to us.&nbsp; We may also collect and record any other relevant information you share with us about yourself, including your interests or your affiliations with other charities, community groups, your employer or a Save the Children corporate partner. If you are a minor, we may collect the name and contact details of a parent or guardian and, where appropriate, the name and location of your school. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to ensure that our communication with you is relevant and tailored to your background and interests, we may supplement what we know about you with information that is available to the public.&nbsp; This allows us to better understand your interests, preferences, and level of potential engagement and/or donation, so that we can contact you in the most appropriate way and to ensure that we do not send you unwanted communications.&nbsp; The information we collect and process about you from publicly-available sources may include demographic information associated with your postcode or your address and an estimate of your age.&nbsp; We may collect this information ourselves or through third-party service providers.&nbsp; For more information on how we work with service providers, please see ‘How will we disclose the information we have collected to outside parties?’.</p>
<p>Where we have identified that you may have the capacity or affinity to support Save the Children at a higher level, we may use the information we hold about you to identify connections between you and our existing circle of key supporters.&nbsp; We may also review other information about you that is available to the public through internet searches, subscription services, or public databases (e.g., Companies House, the electoral register, or the land registry), such as information about corporate directorships, shareholdings, published biographic information, employment and earnings, philanthropic interests and networks, charitable giving history and motivations and relevant media coverage, so that we can engage with you in a more personalised way.</p>
<h3><a name="Do we process ‘sensitive’ personal information?" id="Do we process ‘sensitive’ personal information?">Do we process ‘sensitive’ personal information?</a></h3>
<p>
</p><p>Under data protection law, certain categories of personal information are recognised as sensitive, including health information and information regarding race, religious beliefs, and political opinions (‘sensitive personal data’).&nbsp; In limited cases, we may collect sensitive personal data about you. We would only collect sensitive personal data if there is a clear reason for doing so, such as&nbsp; where we need this information to ensure that we provide appropriate facilities or support to enable you to participate in an athletic event like a marathon. &nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="How do we use your information?" id="How do we use your information?">How do we use your information?</a></h3>
<p>

<li>To provide you with information, products or services that you have requested from us or that we feel may be of interest to you;</li>
<li>To provide you with information about our work or our activities;</li>
<li>To invite you to participate in interactive features on our website;</li>
<li>To process donations we may receive from you;</li>
<li>To fundraise in accordance with our internal policies and procedures;</li>
<li>For administrative purposes (for example, we may contact you regarding an event for which you have registered, to provide information requested from us through Supporter Care or with a query regarding a donation you may have made to us);</li>
<li>For internal record keeping relating to any donations, feedback, or complaints;</li>
<li>To invite you to participate in voluntary surveys or research;</li>
<li>To contact you where you have been identified as a contact person for an organisation, such as a school (if we obtain your contact details in this way, we will only use them to contact you in your capacity as a representative of that organisation);</li>
<li>To analyse and improve the content and operation of our website;</li>
<li>To analyse and improve our internal business processes;</li>
<li>To analyse the personal information we collect about you and use publicly available information to better understand your interests, preferences and level of potential donations so that we can contact you in the most appropriate way and to ensure that we do not send you unwanted communications;</li>
<li>To tailor advertising that is presented to you on the Internet according to your interests, preferences and other characteristics (as described below);</li>
<li>To direct advertisements and other communications to other people who may have similar interests or other characteristics to yours (as described below);</li>
<li>To assess your personal information for the purposes of credit risk reduction or fraud prevention; and</li>
<li>Where we are required by law to disclose or otherwise use your information.</li>
</ul><p>In particular, we may contact you for marketing purposes by email or text message if you have agreed to be contacted in this manner.&nbsp; We may also send you service communications via email or text, for example where you place an order for goods or services on our website, or you have made a donation by text.</p>
<p>If you have provided us with your postal address or telephone number, we may send you information about our work or other communications of the kinds described above by direct mail or contact you by telephone unless you have told us that you would prefer not to hear from us in this way.&nbsp; We provide information about how you can change your marketing preferences below.</p>
<h3><a name="How will we combine and analyse the information we collect about you" id="How will we combine and analyse the information we collect about you">How will we combine and analyse the information we collect about you?</a></h3>
<p>In our Supporter Promise, we have committed to communicating with you using an approach that is right for you. This means that we carefully manage the communications we send you to ensure that we are contacting you in the most appropriate way and that we are not sending you unwanted communications.&nbsp; In order to do this, we may combine the information that we collect about you and analyse what we know about your interests, preferences and level of potential engagement or donation. We may also use statistical analysis to analyse this data and understand the likelihood that you will be interested in or responsive to a campaign or message. We may use third party service providers to assist us in this process.&nbsp; For more information on how we work with service providers, please see ‘How will we disclose the information we have collected to outside parties?’.</p>
<p>Where we have identified that you have the capacity or affinity to support Save the Children at a higher level, we may collect additional information about you (see ‘What information do we collect?’) and combine and analyse that information in a profile of you that will assist us in engaging with you in a more personalised way.</p>
<p>You can opt out of your data being combined and analysed for marketing purposes by contacting our Supporter Care Team or our Data Protection Officer as described below. However, this may mean that you stop receiving marketing communications from us more generally.<br>&nbsp;<br>In accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations and our internal policies and procedures, we may also use personal information to carry out due diligence on potential or actual donors.&nbsp; If you opt out of analysis of your data for due diligence purposes, we may not be able to accept donations from you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save the Children may provide your information to our service providers. Subject to your communication preferences and our internal policies and procedures, this would include providing your information to third parties that work with us to deliver on our charitable purposes, and other entities that act as fundraisers for Save the Children, sell Save the Children products or provide Save the Children with marketing information and services.</p>
<p>Where you have agreed to receive email or SMS marketing communications from us, we may provide your email address or mobile phone number in an encrypted format to social media companies, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or YouTube, or to digital advertising networks that are providing services to us by displaying our advertising to you on those social media platforms and other websites, as well as identifying audiences with interests similar to yours. You can opt out of your data being used to display advertising to you by contacting our Supporter Care Team or our Data Protection Officer as <a href="#How can you change your marketing preferences or update the information we hold about you?">described below</a>.&nbsp; However, this will not prevent our advertisements being shown to you on a randomised basis or based on cookie data and may mean that you stop receiving marketing communications from us more generally.</p>
<p>We enter into contracts with all of these service providers that require them to comply with data protection laws and to ensure that they have appropriate controls in place to protect the security of your information.</p>
<p>We will never sell your details and, except as indicated below, will only share your details with third parties (who are not service providers working at our direction) if you ask us to.&nbsp; We will not make cold telephone calls to members of the general public and, therefore, will not purchase your data in order to do so.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information if we are requested or required to do so by a regulator or law enforcement or in order to enforce or apply our rights (including in relation to our website or other applicable terms and conditions) or to protect Save the Children, for example in cases of suspected fraud or defamation, or in order to comply with any other applicable legal obligation.</p>
<h3><a name="How do we protect your personal information?" id="How do we protect your personal information?">How do we protect your personal information?</a></h3>
<p>
</p><p>We take appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to ensure that we keep your information secure, accurate and up to date, and that we only keep it as long as is reasonable and necessary.</p>
<p>Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your personal information, the transmission of information over the internet is never completely secure. We do our best to protect personal information, but we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to our website, so any transmission is at the user’s own risk. However, any payment card details (such as credit or debit cards) we receive on our website are passed securely to our payment processing provider according to the Payment Card Industry Security Standards.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>For financial and technical reasons, we may, on occasion, need to use the services of a service provider outside the European Economic Area (EEA) – this may include a country which does not have the same level of data protection as in the United Kingdom.&nbsp; However, unless they are located in a country which has been assessed by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection for personal data, we will only use a service provider outside the EEA on the basis of an agreement with the service provider, designed to protect your data, in the appropriate form approved for this purpose by the European Commission.&nbsp; We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is processed securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>When recruiting for a post based in another country, Save the Children will sometimes need to transfer your personal information to that country to progress the recruitment. It may be that that country does not provide the same level of data protection as in the European Economic Area.</p>

<h4><em>What are cookies?</em></h4>
<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device and to target the content displayed to the user’s interests.</p>
<p>You can find more information about cookies at: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a> for a video about cookies, <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/cookies/ " target="_blank">visit this website</a>.</p>
<h4><em>Do we use cookies?</em></h4>
<p>Yes.</p>
<h4><em>Types of cookies</em></h4>
<p>There are two broad types of cookies - 'first party cookies' and 'third party cookies':</p>
<p>First party cookies are cookies that are served directly by the website operator to your computer, and are often used to recognise your computer when it revisits that site and to remember your preferences as you browse the site. Basically, these are our cookies.</p>
<p>Third party cookies are served by a service provider on behalf of the website operator, and can be used by the service provider to recognise your computer when you visit other web sites. Third party cookies are most commonly used for web site analytics or advertising purposes.</p>
<p>In addition, cookies may be either 'session cookies' or 'persistent cookies'. Your computer automatically removes session cookies once you close your browser. Persistent cookies will survive on your computer until an expiry date specified in the cookie itself, is reached. We use both session and persistent cookies.</p>
<h4><em>Categories of cookies we use</em></h4>
<p><em>1. Strictly necessary cookies:</em> These cookies are essential for the user to move around the website and to use its features, e.g. shopping baskets and e-billing.</p>
<p><em>2. Performance cookies:</em> These cookies collect information about how the user makes use of the site, e.g. which pages the user visits most. These cookies do not collect information that identifies the user.</p>
<p><em>3. Functionality cookies:</em> These cookies remember choices made by or attributes of the user and enhance the features and content you experience during your visit to our website, e.g. language, appeals visited or user’s location. This cookie is also used to remember a user's preferences for a font size, or customisable parts of a web page.</p>
<p><em>4. Targeting or advertising cookies:</em> These cookies collect information about the users' browsing habits. This may also include your use of social media sites, e.g. Facebook, etc. or how you interact with our website which then shows you relevant content elsewhere on the internet. NB. These may also be used to choose the advertisements that are displayed to you on our website and other websites.</p>
<p>We have assessed our cookies based on the <a href="https://www.cookielaw.org/media/1096/icc_uk_cookiesguide_revnov.pdf">ICC Cookie Guide</a>. The majority of our cookies fall into the first two categories. However, we also use cookies on our webpages which are in categories 3 and 4.</p>
