			<p><span>Each time You use the Website,  the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply.&nbsp;  Accordingly,  each time You use the Website You should check the date of this Privacy  Policy (which appears at the end) and review any changes since the last  time You used the Website.&nbsp; For additional information, see the  section concerning Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy, below.</span></p><br>

			<span><strong>1. INFORMATION COLLECTION    PRACTICES </strong></span><br><br>
			
			<ol type="a">
			  <li><span><strong>Traffic Data.&nbsp; </strong> Like most website operators, SavingLane automatically gathers  information      of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including:  (i)      IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers  accessing      the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website  (collectively      “<strong>Traffic Data</strong>”).&nbsp; Traffic Data is anonymous information      that does not personally identify You.&nbsp; </span></li><br>

			  <li><span><strong>Cookies.&nbsp; </strong> A “<strong>Cookie</strong>” is a string of information that a website stores      on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the      website each time the user submits a query to the website.&nbsp; The      purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the      Website.&nbsp; SavingLane uses Cookies to customize Your experience      on the Website to Your interests, to ensure that You do not see the      same advertisements or informational messages repeatedly, and to  store      Your password so You do not have to re-enter it each time You visit      the Website.&nbsp; For additional information on SavingLane’s uses      of Cookies, see the section concerning Information Use and  Disclosure      Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies,  below.</span><br>

In each case, You will be asked to provide Personal Information; the       Website will not gather it surreptitiously.&nbsp; SavingLane may  supplement      the Personal Information You provide with additional Personal  Information      gathered from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer  reporting      agencies) who may lawfully provide such information to SavingLane.&nbsp;      You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information, with  the      caveat that Your refusal to do so may prevent You from using certain       of the Services.</span></li>

<br>
			  <li><span>&nbsp;<strong>Information      You Make Public.&nbsp; </strong>The Website contains features (<em>e.g.</em> forums) that permit You to upload, post, transmit, display, perform      or distribute content, information or other, including Your Personal       Information.&nbsp; Any information that You choose to disclose by means      of such features becomes public information over which SavingLane is       unable to exercise control.&nbsp; You should exercise caution when  deciding      to disclose Your Personal Information by means of such features, and       You agree to assume all responsibility for doing so. </span></li>
