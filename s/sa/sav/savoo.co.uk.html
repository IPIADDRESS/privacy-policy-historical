        <p><strong>Service Requests or Loan Products -</strong>
        If you submit a request for a loan product or service offered through
        this website we will share the personal information contained in your
        request form, such as your full name, physical address, telephone
        number, property location and self-assessed value, with lenders in our
        provider network strictly to process and fulfill your request. All

        Not Call List. If one of the lenders contacts you by telephone and you
        wish not to be contacted again by that lender with respect to your
        inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that lender not
        to contact you again. If the lender disregards your request and

        telecommunication service, we will share the personal information
        contained in your request form such as your full name, telephone number
        and email address with our business partners to process and fulfill
        your request. Our business partners may contact you by telephone,
        email, or mail based on the information you provided to us, even if you

        contacted again by that business partner with respect to your inquiry,
        then you should specifically make a request to that partner not to
        contact you again.<br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Vendors - </strong>We sometimes disclose the
        information we collect to companies that host certain services for us
        such as marketing distribution services on our behalf. These vendors
        only have access to personal information needed to perform their
        functions, and may not share it with others or use it for any other
        purpose. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with
        us and other legal restrictions that prohibit them from using the
        information except to market the specified Savoo products or
        services.<br></p>
        
        <p><strong>As Permitted by Law - </strong>We may
        be required to share your personal information with law enforcement or
        government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders,
        federal/state audits or similar circumstances. We believe it is
        necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or
        take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
        involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,
        violations of Savoo's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by
        law.<br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Business Transfer - </strong>As with any
        other business, it is possible that Savoo, Inc. in the future
        could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an
        acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the
        information maintained by Savoo, including customer account
        information, but would continue to be bound by this privacy policy
        unless you consent otherwise. We will provide notice in this instance
        as defined in our "Changes to this Privacy Policy" section below.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cookies and IP Addresses <br></strong></p>
        <p>To serve you faster and with
        better quality, we use "cookies" technology. Cookies are small bits of
        code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a
        Web site to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally use
        cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer
        and to assist with customer tracking. Customer tracking (or
        "click-stream") data collected by us is used to optimize your
        experience by learning whether or not you successfully used
        Savoo. Cookies are not tied to your personal information.
        Additionally, we may capture click-stream data on some of our partner's
        web sites, limited to the activity involved with the completion of
        offers listed on our web site This information is used to monitor the
        performance of our partners. We also allow select third-parties to set
        cookies on our website. For example, we use a tracking service, Revenue
        Science, that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable
        information about our visitors. This aggregate visitor usage
        information collected on Savoo and used by the Revenue Science
        network for the purposes of delivering relevant advertising to our
        audience. Other examples include session cookies when accessing the
        Blog section of the website. These cookies simply track the session and
        are not tied to your personal information.We also keep track of
        Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number that is
        used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time
        you log on to the Internet. <br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Clear Gifs <br></strong></p>
        <p>We employ a software technology
        called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better
        manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
        Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in
        function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web
        users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable
        information. We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us
        know which emails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge
        the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of
        our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these
        emails, please see the Opt-out section within any email you receive
        from us or unsubscribe from our homepage. <br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Confidentiality and Security <br></strong></p>
        <p>The security of your personal
        information is very important at Savoo and we take a number of
        steps to safeguard it. For example: We limit access to personal
        information to those employees or agents who assist us in providing
        requested products and services to you. Employees are required to
        comply with our strict policies and procedures regarding the handling
        of your personal information. Employees who violate these policies are
        subject to our normal disciplinary process. We maintain physical,
        electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal
        standards to guard personal information about you. We use industry
        standard data encryption technologies when transferring and receiving
        consumer data on the Savoo website. <br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Message Boards/Chat Rooms/Blogs</strong></p>
        <p>If you use a message board,
        chat room, or blog on this site, you should be aware that any
        personally identifiable information you submit there can be read,
        collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to
        send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the
        personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these
        forums.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Third Party Links </strong></p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to
        all information that you provide to Savoo. However, when you
        visit websites to which Savoo provides a link, keep in mind you
        will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own
        privacy and security policy. If you choose to obtain certain services
        through a third party site, the data collected by the third party is
        governed by that third party's privacy policy. A third party site will
        also have its own policy regarding the use of cookies and clear gifs.
        We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service
        provider from whom you request services. </p>
        
        <p>If Savoo receives personal information from a third party that is not in conjunction with
        a service offered on our site, the use and disclosure of such
        information is governed by the agreement (if any) between Savoo
        and such third party. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Framing</strong></p>
        <p>In some cases, we may use third
        party vendors to operate portions of the Savoo website. Although
        the particular section of the website may have a similar appearance as
        the Savoo site, information submitted through these outside third
        parties are subject to this Privacy Policy unless otherwise stated. For
        example, personal information submitted through our Affiliate Program
        is subject to our Affiliate Program operator's privacy policy. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Children<br></strong></p>
        <p>We are committed to protecting
        the privacy of children. Savoo's services are not written,
        intended, or designed for children under the age of 13. We do not
        collect personal information from any person we actually know is under
        the age of 13.<br></p>
