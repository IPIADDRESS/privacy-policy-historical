<p><strong>P3P</strong></p>

<p>Savoo is in compliance with the current draft of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) specification, <a href="http://www.w3c.org/P3P" title="http://www.w3c.org/P3P" target="_blank">http://www.w3c.org/P3P</a>, dated April 16, 2002.

Thus, if your browser is Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 6, or later, your browser can electronically interpret the P3P version of our privacy policies.</p>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
