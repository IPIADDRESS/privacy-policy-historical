        <p>Savoo
        is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the
        following policy to understand how your personal information will be
        treated as you make full use of our many offerings. This policy may
        change from time to time so please check back periodically. This
        Privacy Statement only covers the site Savoo.<br></p>
        
        <p><strong>P3P<br></strong></p>
        <p>Savoo
        is in compliance with the current draft of the World Wide Web
        Consortium (W3C) Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) specification, <a href="http://www.w3c.org/P3P" target="_blank">http://www.w3c.org/P3P</a>,
        dated April 16, 2002. This specification was developed to allow users
        to more easily evaluate the use of personal information collected by
        the web sites they visit. Thus, if your browser is Microsoft Internet
        Explorer Version 6, or later, your browser can electronically interpret
        the P3P version of our privacy policies.<br>
        </p>
        
                
        
        <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this
        privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate
        so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it,
        and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. <br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Collection and use of Personal Information <br></strong></p>
        <p>Providing personal information is voluntary. Savoo will collect and use
        personal information about you to respond to your request for products
        and services offered through this website. We will also collect
        information in order to customize the advertising and content you see,
        fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services,
        contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for
        internal and external clients. Once you register with Savoo and
        sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. The information
        we collect may be from the following sources: <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Information provided by
        you in connection with obtaining financial products or services such as
        mortgage loans (such as full name, telephone number, and self-assessed
        property value). <br>
          </li>
          <li>Information you provide us when you register for a user account to receive communications from us
        (such as your email address).<br>
          </li>
          <li>Information you provide us
        when you enter promotions or sweepstakes offered by Savoo or our
        co-branded/partnership sites (such as your full name, physical address
        and email address).<br>
          </li>
          <li>Information you provide us
        through surveys, feedback, or other forms hosted on our website or the
        pages of a Savoo partner/affiliates.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also collect demographic
        information. Demographic information is all other information such as
        gender, postal code, or any information that is not tied to your personal
        information. In addition, we might receive information about you from
        other sources (such as service providers) for tracking purposes. We may
        add the information we receive about you to your existing account. Like
        other websites, we also automatically receive and record certain types
        of information every time you visit us. We use "cookies" and the other
        information to enhance your experience and present you with
        personalized offers. See "Cookies and IP Addresses" section below.<br></p>
        
        <p><strong>With whom your Information may be shared <br></strong></p>
        <p>Savoo does not sell trade
        or rent your personal information to other people or non-affiliated
        companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when
        we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: <br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Service Requests or Loan Products -</strong>
        If you submit a request for a loan product or service offered through
        this website we will share the personal information contained in your
        request form, such as your full name, physical address, telephone
        number, property location and self-assessed value, with lenders in our
        provider network strictly to process and fulfill your request. All
        lenders in our provider network, which include banks, mortgage lenders
        and brokers, have entered into marketing agreements with Savoo
        and are required to comply with federal and state privacy regulations.
        The lenders may contact you by telephone, email, or mail based on the
        information you provided to us in order to process and fulfill your
        request, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List
        administered by the Federal Trade Commission or any state equivalent Do
        Not Call List. If one of the lenders contacts you by telephone and you
        wish not to be contacted again by that lender with respect to your
        inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that lender not
        to contact you again. If the lender disregards your request and
        contacts you again, please let us know immediately by sending an email
        to Savoo <a href="http://savings.zendesk.com/home">Customer Care</a>. Please note that the lenders may
        maintain the information you provided whether you elect to use their
        services or not.<br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Other Service or Products Requests - </strong>If
        you submit a request for a product or service other than a loan such
        telecommunication service, we will share the personal information
        contained in your request form such as your full name, telephone number
        and email address with our business partners to process and fulfill
        your request. Our business partners may contact you by telephone,
        email, or mail based on the information you provided to us, even if you
        have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the
        Federal Trade Commission or any state equivalent Do Not Call List. If
        one of our partners contacts you by telephone and you wish not to be
        contacted again by that business partner with respect to your inquiry,
        then you should specifically make a request to that partner not to
        contact you again.<br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Vendors - </strong>We sometimes disclose the
        information we collect to companies that host certain services for us
        such as marketing distribution services on our behalf. These vendors
        only have access to personal information needed to perform their
        functions, and may not share it with others or use it for any other
        purpose. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with
        us and other legal restrictions that prohibit them from using the
        information except to market the specified Savoo products or
        services.<br></p>
        
        <p><strong>As Permitted by Law - </strong>We may
        be required to share your personal information with law enforcement or
        government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders,
        federal/state audits or similar circumstances. We believe it is
        necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or
        take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
        involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,
        violations of Savoo's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by
        law.<br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Business Transfer - </strong>As with any
        other business, it is possible that Savoo, Inc. in the future
        could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an
        acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the
        information maintained by Savoo, including customer account
        information, but would continue to be bound by this privacy policy
        unless you consent otherwise. We will provide notice in this instance
        as defined in our "Changes to this Privacy Policy" section below.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cookies and IP Addresses <br></strong></p>
        <p>To serve you faster and with
        better quality, we use "cookies" technology. Cookies are small bits of
        code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a
        Web site to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally use
        cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer
        and to assist with customer tracking. Customer tracking (or
        "click-stream") data collected by us is used to optimize your
        experience by learning whether or not you successfully used
        Savoo. Cookies are not tied to your personal information.
        Additionally, we may capture click-stream data on some of our partner's
        web sites, limited to the activity involved with the completion of
        offers listed on our web site This information is used to monitor the
        performance of our partners. We also allow select third-parties to set
        cookies on our website. For example, we use a tracking service, Revenue
        Science, that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable
        information about our visitors. This aggregate visitor usage
        information collected on Savoo and used by the Revenue Science
        network for the purposes of delivering relevant advertising to our
        audience. Other examples include session cookies when accessing the
        Blog section of the website. These cookies simply track the session and
        are not tied to your personal information.We also keep track of
        Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number that is
        used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time
        you log on to the Internet. <br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Clear Gifs <br></strong></p>
        <p>We employ a software technology
        called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better
        manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
        Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in
        function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web
        users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable
        information. We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us
        know which emails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge
        the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of
        our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these
        emails, please see the Opt-out section within any email you receive
        from us or unsubscribe from our homepage. <br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Confidentiality and Security <br></strong></p>
        <p>The security of your personal
        information is very important at Savoo and we take a number of
        steps to safeguard it. For example: We limit access to personal
        information to those employees or agents who assist us in providing
        requested products and services to you. Employees are required to
        comply with our strict policies and procedures regarding the handling
        of your personal information. Employees who violate these policies are
        subject to our normal disciplinary process. We maintain physical,
        electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal
        standards to guard personal information about you. We use industry
        standard data encryption technologies when transferring and receiving
        consumer data on the Savoo website. <br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Message Boards/Chat Rooms/Blogs</strong></p>
        <p>If you use a message board,
        chat room, or blog on this site, you should be aware that any
        personally identifiable information you submit there can be read,
        collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to
        send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the
        personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these
        forums.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Third Party Links </strong></p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to
        all information that you provide to Savoo. However, when you
        visit websites to which Savoo provides a link, keep in mind you
        will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own
        privacy and security policy. If you choose to obtain certain services
        through a third party site, the data collected by the third party is
        governed by that third party's privacy policy. A third party site will
        also have its own policy regarding the use of cookies and clear gifs.
        We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service
        provider from whom you request services. </p>
        
        <p>If Savoo receives personal information from a third party that is not in conjunction with
        a service offered on our site, the use and disclosure of such
        information is governed by the agreement (if any) between Savoo
        and such third party. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Framing</strong></p>
        <p>In some cases, we may use third
        party vendors to operate portions of the Savoo website. Although
        the particular section of the website may have a similar appearance as
        the Savoo site, information submitted through these outside third
        parties are subject to this Privacy Policy unless otherwise stated. For
        example, personal information submitted through our Affiliate Program
        is subject to our Affiliate Program operator's privacy policy. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Children<br></strong></p>
        <p>We are committed to protecting
        the privacy of children. Savoo's services are not written,
        intended, or designed for children under the age of 13. We do not
        collect personal information from any person we actually know is under
        the age of 13.<br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Updating your Information <br></strong></p>
        <p>If you want to access or update the personal information you submitted to Savoo, 
        please contact <a href="http://savings.zendesk.com/home">Customer Care</a>. In the alternative, you
        can write us at the address below and request that your personal
        information be updated. <br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Questions and Suggestions <br></strong></p>

        concerns or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, you may contact <a href="http://savings.zendesk.com/home">Customer Care</a>, or you can send a
        letter to: <br>
