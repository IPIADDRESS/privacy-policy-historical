<h2>SavingStar Cashback Toolbar Privacy Statement</h2>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last Updated: October 15, 2013</p>
<p>The SavingStar Cashback Toolbar is a web browser software application (the “Toolbar”), which is provided by Rakuten Loyalty, a third party toolbar provider (“RLO”). You should <b>read the entire SavingStar Cashback Toolbar Privacy Statement</b>, which follows, before downloading the Toolbar. If you do not accept this SavingStar Cashback Toolbar Privacy Statement, do not install or use the Toolbar or any of its features.</p>
<p>The &nbsp;<a href="http://rakutenloyalty.com/legal-technology-privacy-policy/">Rakuten Technology Privacy Policy</a> also provides information about the collection and use of information by the Toolbar. In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Statement and the Rakuten Technology Privacy Policy, this Privacy Statement will govern.&nbsp; Please note that SavingStar is not responsible for the privacy practices of RLO and that RLO is not responsible for the privacy practices of SavingsStar.</p>
<p><b>Relationship between SavingStar Privacy Statement and the Toolbar Privacy Statement</b></p>
<p>1 . &nbsp;<b>SavingStar Privacy Statement and the Toolbar Privacy Statement</b></p>
<p>The <a href="https://savingstar.com/blog/privacy-policy/">SavingStar Privacy Statement&nbsp;</a>describes the types of personal information we obtain about you in connection with the SavingStar Rewards Program generally, and how we use and share that information, including information obtained when you use the Toolbar. This Toolbar Privacy Statement supplements the <a href="https://savingstar.com/blog/privacy-policy/">SavingStar Privacy Statement</a>&nbsp;and describes the types of personal and other information we may obtain about you and your computer and browser if you install the Toolbar on your computer, and how we use and share that information. In the event of any inconsistency between the SavingStar Privacy Statement and this Toolbar Privacy Statement, this Toolbar Privacy Statement will govern. If you install and/or use the Toolbar, this Toolbar Privacy Statement applies to you. This Toolbar Privacy Statement may change from time to time, so you should check back frequently for any updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 . &nbsp;<b>Information Collected by the Toolbar</b></p>
<p><b>a. General</b></p>
<p>If you install and/or use the Toolbar with respect to an internet browser on your computer, the the Toolbar will collect certain information from your computer when the browser is running. As described more fully in this Toolbar Privacy Statement, this information is collected for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, to help us improve the Toolbar features and functionality, to provide you with your search results, to identify SavingStar partner websites to you, to enable us to process cash back earned by a SavingStar registered user when making an eligible online purchase, application or other transaction at a SavingStar partner website, and to help us understand how often individual SavingStar partner websites are visited.</p>
<p>In addition, the search terms and criteria (“search criteria”) that you may submit in the Toolbar search box or other search boxes that are interconnected with the search functionality in the toolbar, as well as other information, is collected by the Toolbar application and transmitted to RLO and the Toolbar search provider (currently, Yahoo!) (the ”Search Provider”). The transmissions of search criteria are sent unencrypted over the public Internet, so please use caution when including any search terms or other criteria so that they do not include any personal or other sensitive information. Please see Section 2.d and Section 5 for more information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b . &nbsp;<b>When you install the Toolbar,</b><b> the </b><b>Toolbar will collect and store on your computer a unique ID (the “SavingStar ID”) and a different unique ID is also assigned to your Toolbar (the “Toolbar ID”) and stored on your computer, both of which may identify you personally to SavingStar.</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you install the Toolbar, the Toolbar will collect and store on your computer a unique ID (the “SavingStar ID”). In addition, when you install the Toolbar, a different unique ID is assigned to your Toolbar (the “Toolbar ID”) and stored on your computer. SavingStar can use the SavingStar ID and/or the Toolbar ID to identify you personally. RLO cannot use the SavingStar ID or the Toolbar ID to identify you personally, but may have information from another source which would allow it to identify you personally.</p>
<p>In order for you to be able to realize all the benefits of the Toolbar, your browser has to be set to accept cookies. If your browser is set not to accept cookies, SavingStar cannot reward you for eligible online purchases. You should be aware that even if your browser is set not to accept cookies when you install the Toolbar, SavingStar, RLO and the Search Provider may continue to collect search-related information described in this Toolbar Privacy Statement. By not accepting cookies or by clearing your cookies, you will not be uninstalling or disabling the Toolbar. To see how to uninstall the Toolbar, <a href="https://savingstar.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions/#uninstall_toolbar">click here</a>.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;<b>The</b> <b>Toolbar collects and transmits information about your Internet browser, your Installation of the Toolbar and your</b><b> </b><b>Toolbar</b> <b>settings to improve the product and help you get the most out of it.</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;When you first install the Toolbar, and after that whenever you update or uninstall the Toolbar, open a web browser session that includes the Toolbar, change your Toolbar settings, perform similar activities or otherwise, the Toolbar collects and transmits to SavingStar and RLO certain information about your Internet browser and your Toolbar settings. This information, which we call “Event Information,” includes (i) your SavingStar ID and Toolbar ID, (ii) your computer’s IP address, location, operating system, the Internet browser (including the version and subversion) you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer or Safari), product information about your Toolbar and its settings, and the URL of the website from which you came (if any) and the date and time of the visit and its duration. SavingStar can use the SavingStar ID and/or Toolbar ID to identify you personally. RLO, however, cannot use the SavingStar ID or the Toolbar ID to identify you personally, but may have information from another source which would allow it to personally identify you.</p>
<p>We use Event Information for several purposes, such as to understand which the Toolbar features users like and which features could benefit from improvement, based on how the features are used, and to diagnose and address technical issues with the Toolbar.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;The Toolbar collects and provides to such website information about your installation of the Toolbar and your Toolbar settings. We call this information “Header Information” and it includes the Toolbar version installed on your computer along with information about your Toolbar settings. It also includes your SavingStar ID and Toolbar ID. We use this Header Information to improve your Toolbar experience, which may include suggesting ways in which you may optimize your use of the Toolbar. Based on your Header Information, we may also send you messages to suggest ways in which you may better use the Toolbar, or may prompt you to upgrade your Toolbar to a newer version if you are using an older version.</p>
<p>d . &nbsp;<b>Toolbar collects and transmits all search criteria you may submit in the</b><b> </b><b>Toolbar search box and, in certain instances, in any browser search boxes or otherwise if the browser defaults to a search based on your action.</b></p>
<p>The Toolbar collects and transmits all search criteria you may submit in the Toolbar search box, along with the Event Information to SavingStar, RLO and the Search Provider. If you accept SavingStar Search as your browser’s default search provider (through the option provided on the Toolbar installation page), then the Toolbar also collects and transmits all search criteria you may submit in any browser search boxes or otherwise if the browser defaults to a search based on your action (for example, if you type in an invalid website URL and the browser conducts a search to find websites that come close to matching the website URL you entered), along with the Event Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These search criteria and Event Information will be transmitted unencrypted over the public Internet to RLO and the Search Provider. &nbsp;All such search criteria you enter, along with the Event Information, may be used and/or disclosed by the Search Provider to provide the search results and as otherwise described in the Search Provider’s privacy policy with respect to its search services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accordingly, you should use caution not to include in any search criteria any personal or other sensitive information, such as any financial or health information, since such information would be collected by RLO via the Toolbar and would be transmitted to, the Search Provider without any encryption or similar security. &nbsp;<b>SavingStar, RLO and the Search Provider do not have any obligation to maintain this information in any confidential or secure manner, and you should not have any expectation to the contrary.</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;e . &nbsp;<b>Toolbar collects your search results.</b></p>
<p>The Toolbar collects and transmits the search results from searches conducted through the Toolbar and any Toolbar compatible search engine so that the Toolbar may identify and highlight SavingStar partners in the search results.</p>
<p>f . &nbsp;<b>When you visit a website (regardless of whether you access such website via a Toolbar search), the Toolbar will review that website URL to determine if it is a SavingStar partner website. The</b><b> </b><b>Toolbar collects and transmits information to let us know when you visit SavingStar partner websites and when additional Toolbar notifications are presented to you. This information may be associated with your SavingStar ID and/or Toolbar ID.</b></p>

<ul>
<li>The URL of the web page as well as the Event Information will be collected, processed and transmitted to SavingStar and RLO by the Toolbar in order to alert you to what steps you need to take, if any, to activate the SavingStar cash back rewards for eligible purchases, applications or other transactions made on that SavingStar partner website and to process cash back earned by SavingStar registered users.

The SavingStar partner cannot use the SavingStar ID to identify you personally, but may have information from another source (for example, if you provide your contact information in connection with your online purchases, applications or other transactions at the SavingStar partner’s website or during any customer service process) which would allow it to personally identify you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SavingStar receives information about your online purchases, applications or other transactions at SavingStar partner websites through one or more third party tracking agents that track purchases for a network of participating online merchants (“Affiliate Network”). The Affiliate Networks place “cookies” on your computer or hard drive. These cookies are strings of text that are sent to your computer that enable SavingStar to process cash back earned by a SavingStar registered user when making an eligible online purchase, application or other transaction with this SavingStar partner. In the event you make an online purchase, application or other transaction with the SavingStar partner, including through a secure session, SavingStar will receive information about your online purchase, application or transaction, including financial or health information if applicable to the transaction.</li>

For example, we may show you notifications to suggest ways in which you may better use the Toolbar.</p>
<p>3 . &nbsp;<b>Information collected and transmitted by the</b><b> </b><b>Toolbar is used for a variety of purposes</b></p>
<p>SavingStar may use the information collected and transmitted by the Toolbar and received by SavingStar to develop, offer, deliver, operate and improve the SavingStar website, services, and applications; for its own data analytical purposes; to understand how often partner websites are visited; to offer products and services of our affiliates, participating companies, marketing partners and other companies; to process transactions in your accounts; to fulfill legal and regulatory requirements; and as otherwise permitted by applicable law.

<li>Help us present cash back opportunities and other content to you in an effort to create a personally relevant experience. For example, we may use information about the SavingStar partner websites you visit to provide you special offers.

<li>Help us conduct marketing analysis, including helping us formulate and predict responses to various marketing campaigns, and to deliver and help determine the effectiveness of various marketing campaigns.</li>
<li>Help us support you when you contact SavingStar Customer Care.</li>
</ul>

We also may collect information about your interaction with those suggestions, such as whether or not you clicked on a link presented in a notification.</p>
<p>4 . &nbsp;<b>How Collected Information is Shared</b></p>
<p>The Toolbar generally collects and transmits the information described in this Toolbar Privacy Statement to RLO (and as described, the Search Provider), which uses the information collected and transmitted by the Toolbar to help us provide services to you.</p>
