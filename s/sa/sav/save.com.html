  <h2><a name="safeHarbor" class="page-anchor"></a>VALASSIS SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT</h2>
  <p>Valassis Communications, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as the (Company) strives to collect, use
    and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the
    countries in which we do business, and pride ourselves on upholding the highest
    ethical standards in our business practices. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy
    (the "Policy") sets forth the privacy principles that the Company
    follows with respect to personal information transferred from the European
    Union (EU) and Switzerland to the United States.</p>
  <h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe Harbor Compliancy Affirmative
    Statement for U.S.-E.U and U.S.-Swiss Framework</h3>
  <p>Valassis Communications, Inc. complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework
    and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of
    Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information
    from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Valassis has certified
    that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward
    transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more
    about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Valassis's certification, please
    visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a></p>
  <h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Scope</h3>
  <p>The U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a
    set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the U.S.-EU
    Safe Harbor Framework) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement
    under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information
    transferred from the EU to the United States. The U.S. Department of Commerce
    and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland
    have agreed on a similar set of data protection principles and frequently asked
    questions (the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework). Consistent with its
    commitment to protect personal privacy, the Company adheres to the respective
    Safe Harbor Principles. The Policy applies to all personal information received
    by the Company in the United States from the European Union and Switzerland. <br>
    <br>
    For additional information regarding the Safe Harbor Program, see the U.S.
    Dept. of Commerce web site at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>. </p>
  <h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Privacy Principles</h3>
  <p>The privacy principles in this Policy are based on the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>
  <h3>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice</h3>
  <p>Where the Company collects personal information directly from individuals in
    the EU and Switzerland, it will inform them about the type of personal
    information collected, the purposes for which it collects and uses the personal
    information, and the types of non-agent third parties to which the Company
    discloses or may disclose that information to, and the choices and means, if
    any, the Company offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of
    their personal information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous
    language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to
    the Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before the
    Company uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than that for
    which it was originally collected.</p>
  <h3>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Choice</h3>
  <p>The Company will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether
    their personal information is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party or to
    be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally
    collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.<br>
    <br>
    For sensitive personal information, the Company will give individuals the
    opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure
    of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for
    a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or
    subsequently authorized by the individual.</p>
  <h3>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Onward Transfer</h3>
  <p>The Company only transfers Personal Data to a service provider, vendor or other
    third party acting as a processor of Personal Data for the Company (an
    "agent") where the agent has provided assurances that said agent
    provides at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by these
    privacy principles. Where the Company has knowledge that one of its agents is
    using or sharing Personal Data in a way that is contrary to these principles,
    the Company will take reasonable and appropriate steps to prevent or stop such
    processing. The Company will only transfer Personal Data to a non-agent third
    party where such transfer is consistent with applicable laws and with the
    notice provided to the data owners at the time the Personal Data were
    collected.</p>
  <h3>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Security</h3>
  <p>The Company takes reasonable precautions to protect EU and Swiss Personal Data
    in its possession to prevent loss, misuse, disclosure, unauthorized access,
    alteration or destruction.</p>
  <h3>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Integrity</h3>
  <p>Personal information collected will only be processed in a way that is
    compatible and relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. To the
    extent necessary for those purposes, the Company will take reasonable steps to
    ensure the data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.</p>
  <h3>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Access</h3>
  <p>Upon request, data subjects will have access to their EU or Swiss Personal Data
    held by the Company and may correct, amend, or delete their Personal Data if it
    is inaccurate. However, access to such EU or Swiss Personal Data may be denied,
    when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the
    risks to the data subject's privacy in the case in question, or where the
    rights of persons other than the data subjects would be violated. </p>
  <h3>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enforcement</h3>
  <p>The Company will internally assess the Policies and their practices to ensure
    continuous compliance with the Safe Harbor frameworks. Any Company employee
    found to have violated the privacy principles in this Safe Harbor Statement
    will be subject to appropriate corrective actions up to and including
    termination of employment. </p>
  <h3>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dispute Resolution</h3>
  <p>Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of personal
    information should be directed to the Companies' Privacy Office at the address
    given below. The Company will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and
    disputes regarding use or disclosure of personal information in accordance with
    the principles contained in this Policy. For complaints that cannot be resolved
    between the Company and the complainant, the Company has agreed to participate
    in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the European
    data protection authorities to resolve disputes pursuant to the Safe Harbor
    Principles, and to cooperate and comply with the Federal Data Protection and
    Information Commissioner of Switzerland. </p>
