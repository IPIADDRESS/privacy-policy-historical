        you may not be able to access all parts of the website or interact with

        In addition, Save the Children uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, 
        to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our 
        ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to 
        recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables 
        us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie 
        was placed by DoubleClick, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. 
        With both cookies and the pixel technology, the information that we collect

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. 
        Credit Card Transactions and Merchandise Purchases.</strong> Save the 
        Children hires third parties to provide credit card processing services 
        and order fulfillment services. If you have opted to donate on-line, 
        become a sponsor, or purchase merchandise from our “virtual” 
        craft shop, we may share your personal information, including credit 
        card or billing information, with these service providers. We make an 
        effort to require all third party service-providers to hold personal 
        information in strict confidence. While we believe these other companies 
        are upstanding and will treat your personal information responsibly, 
        we do not own or control them. </font></p>
        
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. 
        Necessity.</strong> If the law or a regulatory authority compels us, 
        Save the Children will disclose personal information. Also, if we have 
        reason to believe that there has been some inappropriate interference 
        with or use of the Save the Children website or services (see our <a href="link_to_scf.shtml" class="bot">Terms 
        of Use Agreement</a>), or if we have reason to believe that one of our 
        website users may have been injured or has harmed some other party, we 
        will disclose personal information as we deem appropriate or if asked 
        by a legal or regulatory authority.</font></p>

        Does Save the Children share non-personal (aggregated) information with 
        third parties? </strong><br>
        Yes, Save the Children may share aggregate, statistical and other non-personal 
        information with our advertisers and other third parties. For example, 
        we may share the number of our website visitors from various states with 
        an advertiser, or the number of visitors to our website. These aggregate 
        statistics do not include personal information. </font></p>

        What rules apply if I "click" over to another website? </strong><br>
        In order to provide certain services and materials, Save the Children 
        contracts with other companies and individuals to support our website 
        activities. These additional services and materials may include providing 
        "links" to other websites from our website. Except as may be 
        outlined in this policy, the privacy policies of Save the Children do 
        not apply to any third-party sites. Anytime you leave the Save the Children 
        website, we have no control regarding what information may be collected 
        about you, nor do we control what third-parties might do with the information. 
        For example, when you click on a merchant's name at the Save the Children 
        site, you will be connected with the third-party merchant's website (even 
        if our name/logo is on the screen). This merchant website should have 
        its own privacy policy applying to transactions at their website. It 
        is important that you review any privacy policies on third-party sites 
        carefully, BEFORE you use any services or programs offered.</font></p>

        All on-line transactions are done on a secure server. This information 
        remains confidential and is not shared with any outside sources. </font></p>

        and/or changing the uses of the information. In these instances, we will 
        endeavor to edit this policy in a timely fashion to explain the new practices.
