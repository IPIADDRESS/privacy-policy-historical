        access all parts of the website or interact with us without supplying 
        personal information. If you choose to take advantage of some of our services, 
        we will sometimes request personal information (information that allows 
        us to identify you). For example, if you ask to sponsor a child, we will 
        ask you to provide us with personal information including your address, 
        telephone number and other identifying information.</div>

      <div class="question"><b>D. How is personal information used by Save the

      <div class="answer">Personal information will be used internally by Save 
        the Children to provide you with information about Save the Children's 
        work and ways that you can further support our efforts. We also will use 
        this information to provide you access to various sections of our website

      <a name="questE"></a> 
      <div class="question"><b>E. Does Save the Children share information (personal) 
        with others? </b></div>
      <div class="answer">Save the Children shares some personal information with 
        others, as follows: <br>
        <br>
        <b>NAMES AND MAILING ADDRESSES:</b> Save the Children may share the names 
        and mailing addresses of its child and program sponsors with our corporate 
        partners (corporations supporting Save the Children's missions). In addition, 
        Save the Children may share or rent the names and addresses of donors 
        who are not child or program sponsors with other non-profit organizations 
        and corporate partners as a way of reducing our fundraising costs. For 
        these reasons, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy, 
        and the opt-out provisions, whenever we ask you for personal information 
        at this website. 
        <p><b>PHONE NUMBERS AND E-MAIL ADDRESSES</b>: Save the Children will not 
          share the phone numbers or e-mail addresses of our sponsors, general 
          donors and supporters without prior, specific consent. </p>
        <p><b>TO OPT OUT</b>: If you would prefer that your name and mailing address 
          not be shared with other non-profit organizations or our corporate partners, 
          or if you have previously given consent to share your name and address 
          and would prefer to opt out, please go to the communications preferences 
          section of our <a href="/homesignin.jsp">registration page</a> and indicate 
          your preferences. Or, in the alternative, you may call us at 1-800-728-3843 
          or 203-221-4030, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Eastern 
          Standard Time, and we will remove your name.<br>
          Save the Children will make every endeavor to change your account information 
          within 10 business days of your providing us with this information. 
          Please note that some mailings may already be in progress, and we may 
          not be able to effectuate the change in your account prior to the mailing. 
        </p>
        <p><b>EXCEPTIONS</b>: Save the Children will share your personal information 
          in connection with certain activities:<br>
          <br>
          <b>A. Service Providers</b>. Save the Children hires third parties to 
          provide certain administrative services - such as processing credit 
          card transactions, preparing address labels, managing databases, and 
          sending mailings - which requires Save the Children to share personal 
          information with these service providers. We make an effort to require 
          all third party service-providers to hold personal information in strict 
          confidence. While we believe these other companies are upstanding and 
          will treat your personal information responsibly, we don't own or control 
          them. <br>
          <br>
          <b>B. Necessity.</b> If the law, or a regulatory authority compels us, 
          Save the Children will disclose personal information. Also, if we have 
          reason to believe that there has been some inappropriate interference 
          with or use of the Save the Children website, or if we have reason to 
          believe that one of our website users may have been injured or harmed 
          some other party, we will disclose personal information as we deem appropriate 
          or if asked by a legal or regulatory authority. </p>
        <p><b>NON-PERSONAL, AGGREGATED INFORMATION:</b> Save the Children may 
          share aggregate, statistical and other non-personal information with 
          our advertisers and other third parties. For example, we may share the 
          number of our website visitors from various states with an advertiser, 
          or the number of visitors to our website. These aggregate statistics 
          do not include personal information. </p>
        <p>Remember, you are under no obligation to disclose any personal information 
          if you do not want to. If you are not comfortable with the Save the 
          Children's uses of information, you may always decide to opt out or 
          decide not to use those website services or features that require personal 
          information. <br>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p></div>

      <div class="question"><b>F. What rules apply if I "click" over to another 
        website? </b></div>
      <div class="answer">In order to provide certain services and materials, 
        Save the Children contracts with other companies and individuals to support 
        our website activities. These additional services and materials may include 
        providing "links" to other websites from our website. Except as may be 
        outlined in this statement, this Statement does not apply to any third-party 
        sites. Anytime you leave the Save the Children website, we have no control 
        regarding what information may be collected about you, nor can we control 
        what third-parties might do with the information. Save the Children is 
        not responsible for, and has no control over, the information collection 
        or privacy practices of other websites. For example, when you click on 
        a merchant's name at the Save the Children site, you will be connected 
        with the third-party merchant's website (even if our name/logo is on the 
        screen). This merchant website should have its own privacy policy applying 
        to transactions at their website. It is important that you review any 
        privacy policies on third-party sites carefully, BEFORE you use any services 
        or programs offered. If you cannot find or do not like a website's privacy 
        policy, you may choose not to offer information to that site.</div>
      <a name="questG"></a> 
      <div class="question"><b>G. How does the Save the Children website provide 
        security and confidentiality of information? </b></div>
      <div class="answer">Save the Children has built in several layers of security 
        into our system. All on-line transactions are done on a secure server. 
        This information remains confidential and is not shared with any outside 
        sources.</div>
