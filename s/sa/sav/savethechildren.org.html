		<a name="questA"></a>
		<div class="question"><b>A. Do I have to submit any personal information in order to visit the Save the Children website?</b></div>

<div class="answer">We do not ask you to submit personal information if you are just browsing at our website. However, you may not be able to access all parts of the website or interact with us without supplying personal information. If you choose to take advantage of some of our services, we will sometimes request personal information (information that allows us to identify you). For example, if you ask to sponsor a child, we will ask you to provide us with personal information including your address, telephone number and other identifying information.</div>

<a name="questB"></a>
<div class="question"><b>B. What are "cookies," and does the Save the Children website use "cookies?"</b></div>

<div class="answer">A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from Save the Children's web server and is stored on your computer's hard drive. Save the Children uses cookies. In addition, when you visit our site we may automatically capture and recognize domain names and e-mail addresses.</div>

<a name="questC"></a>
<div class="question"><b>C. How does Save the Children use "cookie" information and can I control its use? </b></div>

<div class="answer">Cookie information is used by Save the Children to keep and sometimes track information about you in order to deliver better and more personalized services and better administration of our website. For example, we may use the information for tracking which areas of our website you have visited, and how frequently. In addition, cookies help us to diagnose problems with our server. We may use domain names and e-mail addresses to gather demographic information about our user community. We may also match information obtained from cookies with other data you, or third parties, provided in order develop statistics. This type of information helps Save the Children provide services and site content that is interesting to our visitors.</div>

<div class="answer">Please check your computer or software manual for specifics on how cookies work on your particular computer. It is possible to block cookies from being loaded onto your computer. Please note, however, that blocking cookies can affect the performance of websites, including loading time, with your computer.</div>

<a name="questD"></a>
<div class="question"><b>D. Does Save the Children ever collect personal information, such as my name, address or credit card information, through its website?</b></div>

<div class="answer">At certain sections on our website, you may be asked to submit personal information. This includes, but may not be limited to, your name, address, zip code, telephone number, organization name and e-mail address. In addition, in order to make an on-line contribution to Save the Children, or to complete a purchase in our "virtual" Craft Shop, we may ask you to provide credit card or other billing information.</div>

<a name="questE"></a>
<div class="question"><b>E. How is personal information used by Save the Children, and can I control its use?</b></div>

<div class="answer">Personal information will be used only internally by Save the Children to provide you updates on information you have requested. We also will use this information to provide you access to various sections of our website that are personalized for your needs.</div>

<div class="answer">You do not have to disclose any personal information if you do not want to. You can always decide not to use those web-site services or features that require such information. Our interest is to offer you convenient online services that match your interests - the choice is yours.</div>

<a name="questF"></a>
<div class="question"><b>F. Does Save the Children share information (personal or cookies) with other companies or organizations?</b></div>

<div class="answer">Our policy regarding personal information is simple: except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Save the Children will not give, sell or rent any personal information to third parties without telling you in advance and giving you the opportunity to tell us not to share the information. We make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy and Acceptable Use Policy whenever we ask you for personal information.</div>

<div class="answer">Save the Children hires third parties to provide certain administrative services - such as processing credit card transactions, preparing address labels, managing databases, and sending mailings - which requires Save the Children to provide third parties with access to certain information. We make an effort to require all third party service-providers to hold personal information in strict confidence. While we believe these other companies are upstanding and will treat your personal information responsibly, we don't own or control them.</div>

<div class="answer">Further, if we are compelled by law, or some other regulatory authority, Save the Children will disclose personal information. Also, if we have reason to believe that there has been some inappropriate interference with or use of the Save the Children website, or if we have reason to believe that one of our website users may have been injured or some other party harmed, we will disclose personal information as we deem appropriate or if asked by a legal or regulatory authority.</div>

<div class="answer">Finally, we may share aggregate, statistical and other non-personal information with our advertisers and other third parties. For example, we may share the number of our website visitors from various states with an advertiser, or the number of visitors to our website. These aggregate statistics do not include personal information.</div>

<div class="answer">Remember, you are under no obligation to disclose any personal information if you do not want to. If you are not comfortable with the Save the Children's uses of information, you can always decide not to use those web-site services or features that require such information.</div>

<a name="questG"></a>
<div class="question"><b>G. What rules apply if I "click" over to another website?</b></div>

<div class="answer">In order to provide certain services and materials, Save the Children contracts with other companies and individuals to support our website activities. These additional services and materials may include providing "links" to other websites from our website. Except as may be outlined in this statement, this Statement does not apply to any third-party sites. Anytime you leave the Save the Children website, we have no control regarding what information may be collected about you, nor can we control what third-parties might do with the information. Save the Children is not responsible for, and has no control over, the information collection or privacy practices of other websites. For example, when you click on a merchant's name at the Save the Children site, you will be connected with the third-party merchant's website (even if our name/logo is on the screen). This merchant website should have its own privacy policy applying to transactions at their website. It is important that you review any privacy policies on third-party sites carefully, BEFORE you use any services or programs offered. If you cannot find or do not like a website's privacy policy, you may choose not to offer information to that site.</div>

<a name="questH"></a>
<div class="question"><b>H. How does the Save the Children website provide security and confidentiality of information?</b></div>

<div class="answer">Save the Children has built in several layers of security into our system. All on-line transactions are done on a secure server. This information remains confidential and is not shared with any outside sources.</div>

<a name="questI"></a>
<div class="question"><b>I. Are there limitations on my use of the information and technology at the website?</b></div>

<div class="answer">When you use our website, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions contained in this Statement. These terms and conditions have been developed for your protection, as well as ours. Save the Children owns the materials and technology, or has the right to use the materials and technology, included on the Save the Children site. No one outside Save the Children may use any of the material or technology for any purpose, including personal financial gain or other inappropriate activity. Remember, if choose not to accept the terms and conditions of this Statement, you are free to "click" away from our website.</div>

<div class="answer"><span class="red"><b>It is improper, and may be a violation of law, for you to post or download and distribute any material that you do not own or for which you do not have permission to use. PLEASE BE AWARE: violation of someone's copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights may subject you to civil or criminal penalties.</b></span></div>
