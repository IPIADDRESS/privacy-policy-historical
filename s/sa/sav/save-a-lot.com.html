<h3 id="section1"><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>

<p>We are Moran Foods, LLC, operating under the brand name SAVE A LOT (“Save A Lot,” “we,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy applies to the websites owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy (we call these the “Sites”).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="section2"><strong>Independent Stores</strong></h3>

<p>We also have licensing and wholesale relationships with a network of independent retailers that independently own and operate their grocery stores (“<strong>Independent Stores</strong>”), but who license the use of our brand name and/or use our wholesale distribution network. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some Independent Stores may operate their own websites or mobile applications, separate and apart from the Site. Those websites and mobile applications are not operated by us and are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Please review the privacy policy posted on those websites or mobile applications to understand the applicable information practices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="section3"><strong>How We Collect and Use Personal Information</strong></h3>

<p>When we use the term “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” in this Privacy Policy, we mean any information that we directly associate with a specific person, or that reasonably can be used to identify a specific person. &nbsp;For example, this includes your name, home address, phone number, email address, birthday and any other information that we tie to these elements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Personal Information does not include “aggregated information,” which is information that we collect about a group or category of persons or services.&nbsp; It also does not include “de-identified information,” which is information from which we or our agents have removed information that can be used to specifically identify a person. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our collection, use, or disclosure of aggregated or de-identified information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We collect the following types of Personal Information when you use our Site:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1. Information You Provide </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We collect Personal Information you provide, for example when you enter the information into form fields on our Sites or enroll in our Smart Shopper Club program. &nbsp;For example, we may collect:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>contact information, such as your name, home address, and email address, which we use to communicate with you and authenticate you as a user;</li>
	<li>demographic information, including age, product preferences, preferred store location and other interests and likes, which we use to better understand and analyze our customer population, support our operations including inventory and product management, to deliver relevant offers and ads, and to improve our products and services including the Site;</li>
	<li>communications preferences, including marketing preferences, which we &nbsp;use to manage how we engage with you;</li>
	<li>application information related to becoming an owner of an Independent Store;</li>
	<li>the content of inquiries you make.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Information Collected Automatically</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We use various technologies to collect other types of data that do not directly reveal your identity (“<strong>Other Information</strong>”). &nbsp;If we associate Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These technologies include the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Logging Functionality: </strong>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and/or clickstream data. &nbsp;We generally only use this data for purposes such as security, fraud detection, and protecting our rights.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies: </strong>We and third parties we work with use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to manage our websites and email messages and to collect and track information about you and your activities online over time and across different websites. &nbsp;In addition, we use local shared objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and how you interact with the Site. These technologies help us to recognize you, customize or personalize your shopping experience, and analyze the use of our Site and solutions to make them more useful to you. These technologies also allow us to aggregate demographic and statistical data and compilations of information, which may or may not include Personal Information, and provide this information to our service providers. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Most Internet browsers allow you to remove or manage cookie functions and adjust your privacy and security preferences. &nbsp;For information on how to do this, access the “help” menu on your Internet browser, or visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-control-cookies/">http://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-control-cookies/</a>. &nbsp;Please note, however, that disabling our cookies may result in your inability to take full advantage of all of the features of the Site. To manage Flash cookies please <a>visit </a><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Adobe’s website</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Analytics</strong>: &nbsp;We use analytics providers such as Google Analytics to help us evaluate and measure the use and performance of our Site.&nbsp; To opt out of the aggregation and analysis of data collected about you on our website by Google Analytics, visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> and download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Information We Obtain from Third Party Sources</strong></p>

<p>We may receive additional Personal Information from third party sources that we may append to existing consumer information, such as email and mailing address verification.&nbsp; We use this supplemental information to better understand our consumers, deliver relevant offers and advertising, and improve our operations, stores, Site and our advertising and marketing campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Location Information &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>We may collect location information through the Site so we can offer you certain location-based services (such as delivering advertisements that are relevant to your particular location, and conducting analytics to improve our stores and the Site).&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may use various technologies, including IP lookup, to detect your location so that we can automatically show you the closest store to your area, rather than some random location. Depending on browser type, your browser may inform you that the website would like to collect your location and request your permission to do so. If you allow it, location information is then collected and may be stored locally on your device. If you decline the collection of location information, your location is not collected and you must manually enter your location.</p>

<h3 id="section4"><strong>Additional Uses of Personal Information</strong></h3>

<p>In addition to the uses described above, we may use your Personal Information for the following purposes:</p>

<ul><li>Operating our business, delivering our products and services, and for any other lawful, legitimate business purposes;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Contacting you to respond to your requests or inquiries;</li>
	<li>Providing you with newsletters, articles, product or service alerts, new product or service announcements, savings awards, event invitations, and other information;</li>
	<li>Contacting you about programs, products, or services that we believe may be of interest to you, or sharing with you special offers from other companies;</li>
	<li>Providing you with personally tailored coupons, programs, promotional information, offers, and other information;</li>
	<li>Conducting market research, surveys, and similar inquiries to help us understand trends and customer needs across product categories or customer groups;</li>

	<li>Preventing, investigating, or providing notice of fraud, unlawful or criminal activity, or unauthorized access to or use of Personal Information, our website or data systems; or to meet legal obligations;</li>
	<li>Enforcing our Terms of Use and other agreements.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="section5"><strong>How We Share and Disclose Personal Information</strong></h3>

<p>We share your Personal Information with third parties only in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers: &nbsp;</strong>We share your Personal Information with third party service providers who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf or for your benefit, such as for website hosting, administering the Smart Shopper Club program, marketing, analytics, processing employment applications and performing human resources administration, or to verify customer data, such as mailing addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Process, Safety and Terms Enforcement:</strong> &nbsp;We may disclose your Personal Information to legal or government regulatory authorities in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose your Personal Information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes or litigation, when otherwise required by law, or if we determine its disclosure is necessary to protect the health and safety of you or us, or to enforce our legal rights or contractual commitments that you have made.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="section6"><a href="http://youradchoices.com/"><strong>Your Ad Choices</strong>&nbsp;</a></h3>
