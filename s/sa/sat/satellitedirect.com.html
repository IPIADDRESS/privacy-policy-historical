<br><br>This
privacy policy is intended to inform you about the types of information
gathered by ETVCORP (“we” or “us”) when you visit SatelliteDirect.com and/or
purchase the SatelliteDirect or SatelliteDirect Advanced software (“Software”),
how we use and safeguard that information, and the degree to which you may
control the maintenance and sharing of your information.
<br><br><b>Information Collection<br>
</b>When you
visit SatelliteDirect.com, we will not collect any personally identifiable
information about you unless you choose to provide such information to us.<b></b>
<br><br>If you choose
to purchase Software, we will ask you to provide certain personally
identifiable information such as your name and email address, as well as credit
card or other payment information and a billing address. We use this
information as required to provide you with the product you have requested.
<br><br>We do not
directly collect or store any personal financial information provided in
connection with your purchase of Software. All personal financial information
required to complete your purchase (such as your credit card number) will be provided
to and/or collected by a third party vendor who will process payments and complete
transactions.
<br><br><b>Log Files<br>
</b>We may automatically
and through third-party tracking services (e.g., Google Analytics) gather
certain non-personally identifiable information about your use of our websites
and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP)
addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,
operating system, date/time stamps, and related data. We use this information,
which does not identify individual users, solely to improve the quality of SatelliteDirect.com.
Out of respect for your privacy, we do not link this automatically-collected
data to personally identifiable information. 
<br><br><b>Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for
record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and tracking cookies.
We use session cookies to make it easier for you to use SatelliteDirect.com. A

advantage of all of our offerings. We do not link the information we store in cookies
to any personally identifiable information you submit while using SatelliteDirect.com.
<br><br><b>Information Use and Disclosure</b><br>
<b>Notifications &amp; Opt-Out<br>

to our related companies, service providers and suppliers, to enable them to
fulfill a product or service request or to perform a business, professional or
technical support function for us; (2) as necessary if we believe that there
has been a violation of a EULA or of our rights or the rights of any third
party; and (3)<b> </b>to respond to judicial process and provide information to
law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters
related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.<b></b>

<br><br><b>Business Transitions<br>
</b>In the
event ETVCORP goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition
by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, any personally
identifiable information we have on record will likely be among the assets
transferred. The transferred personally identifiable information will remain
subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy or any subsequent updated
versions.
<br><br><b>Information Security<br>
</b>We employ encryption
and other security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the
information under our control.<b> </b>Whenever you provide us or our partners with
sensitive or confidential information, we or our partners will take
commercially reasonable steps to protect such information by establishing a secure
connection with your web browser, such as employing a security technology known
as a secure-socket-layer (“SSL”) to protect the transmission of such
information. <b></b>
<br><br>However,
please be advised that while we make every effort to ensure the integrity and
security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security
measures will prevent unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other
breaches from ever occurring. You transmit information to us at your  own risk.
