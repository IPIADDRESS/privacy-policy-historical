					    <h3 id="part1">PART I: PERSONAL DATA PROCESSED ON BEHALF OF SATMETRIX CLIENTS</h3>
					    <p>As  a general description of our data processing services, Satmetrix  collects (and analyzes) survey responses from our clients' customers  who consent to be contacted or who have pre-existing relationships with  the Satmetrix client for which Satmetrix is conducting a survey. As  described in this Part I, Satmetrix does not own the Personal Data that  we process.</p>
					    <h4 id="part1-1">1. SATMETRIX IS A DATA PROCESSOR</h4>
					    <p>Satmetrix  processes, on behalf of its clients (Satmetrix's "Clients"), Personal  Data that has been collected by or on behalf of those Clients.  "Personal Data" means information relating to an identified or  identifiable person. Under the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="out" title="Open this link in a new window">United States/European Union Data Protection Safe Harbor Arrangement</a> (the "Safe Harbor"), Satmetrix acts as a Data Processor and each  Satmetrix Client acts as a Data Controller. For the purposes of the  Safe Harbor and this Privacy Statement: a "Data Processor" is an entity  that processes Personal Data on behalf of a Data Controller; a "Data  Controller" is an entity that determines the purposes for which  Personal Data are processed. To "process" Personal Data means to carry  out an operation or set of operations on such Personal Data, such as  collecting, recording, storing, disclosing, or organizing it. The "Data  Subject" means the person to whom a certain set of Personal Data  relate; for example, the person who responds to a survey.</p>
					    <h4 id="part1-2">2. CLIENT INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
					    <p>As  a Data Processor, Satmetrix will only process Personal Data pursuant to  the instructions of the applicable Client. Satmetrix may use the  services of third party Data Processors to process Personal Data in  accordance with purposes identified for such Personal Data by the  applicable Client. Subject to the foregoing sentence and <a href="./privacy.php#part3-1">Section 1 of Part III</a> ("Security Measures") below, Satmetrix will not transfer Personal Data  to a Third Party (which, for purposes of this Privacy Statement, means  an entity other than Satmetrix and its applicable Client) without  instructions from the applicable Client. Satmetrix will not be  responsible for determining the authenticity of any purported Data  Subject's request to access his or her Personal Data. In the absence of  express instructions to do so from the applicable Client, Satmetrix  will not provide a purported Data Subject with access to his or her  Personal Data unless it is demonstrated to Satmetrix's satisfaction  that the applicable Data Controller has refused such access.</p>
					    <p>Satmetrix  does not review, comment upon, or monitor its Clients' compliance with  their respective privacy policies, nor does Satmetrix review Client  instructions to determine whether they are in compliance or conflict  with the terms of a Client's published privacy policy.</p>
					    <h4 id="part1-3">3. PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION</h4>
					    <p>Customer  satisfaction surveys are initiated to improve the processes and  relationships between our Clients and their customers. Typically a  Client's customers provide the Client with certain information  including their names, companies, job titles, phone numbers, and email  addresses and the Client provides such information to Satmetrix to  enable us to process and analyze surveys on behalf of the Client. In  addition, commercial list services may provide Satmetrix with contact  information for people who have opted to receive email ("opt-in lists")  on specific topics of interest.</p>
					    <p>We invite Client  customers — via email, telephone, web page banners, web pop-ups, and  other media — to fill out surveys hosted on Satmetrix's site (i.e.,  satmetrix.com, ccsurvey.com, or any successor web site). Participation  in these surveys is voluntary. When a survey respondent uses the  Satmetrix site to fill out a survey, our servers (which are hosted by a  third party service provider) may collect information indirectly and  automatically (through, for example, the use of "cookies" or your "IP  address") about your activities on the site while responding to the  survey. We use this browsing information, in non-personally  identifiable form, for internal purposes such as to help understand how  the site is being used and to improve it, and for systems  administration purposes. We do not link the information we store in  cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on  our site.</p>
					    <p>Cookies are small pieces of information stored  on respondent's hard drive, not on our site. Cookies allow us to better  understand how respondents use the site, which in turn helps us focus  our resources on improvements to the site. We use session cookies,  which expire when the browser window is closed, and persistent cookies  to keep track of which survey(s) a particular respondent has answered.  A respondent is always free to decline our cookies if her browser  permits, but in that case, the survey site may not operate properly or  a respondent may be prompted to fill out the same survey multiple times  at a client's site. An IP address is a number that is automatically  assigned to a computer when it is used on a network like the Internet.  In some cases the computer's IP address stays the same from browser  session to browser session; but, for computers connecting to the  Internet via consumer Internet access providers, the IP address  generally varies from session to session.</p>
					    <p>In some cases,  we use unique identifiers in email messages, which enable us to  determine which emails have generated responses. This allows us to  gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and to exclude those  persons who have already responded to a certain message from duplicate  messages.</p>
					    <p>Survey respondents may be required to submit  information such as a mailing address in order receive a gift or other  offering (if applicable).</p>
					    <p>In the email survey invitations  we send, we provide an opportunity for recipients to 'opt-out' of  receiving future email survey invitations on behalf of the applicable  Client.</p>
					    <h4 id="part1-4">4. USE OF NORMATIVE DATA</h4>
					    <p>Satmetrix  provides research services to its Clients in which Satmetrix analyzes a  Client's customer performance data in comparison with that of other  companies in the same industry as the Client ("Normative Research").  However, Satmetrix does not process any Personal Data in performing  Normative Research: (a) Satmetrix uses only non-Personal Data (i.e.,  data that includes no personally identifiable information or unique  identifiers that could later be used to refer to the personally  identifiable information to which the data was once associated) in  performing this Normative Research, and (b) Satmetrix discloses only  non-Personal Data in aggregate form ("Normative Data") to its Clients  who have requested Normative Research.</p>
					    <h3 id="part2">PART II: BUSINESS CONTACT INFORMATION</h3>
					    <p>In  addition to the data we process on behalf of our Clients, Satmetrix  also processes (on its own behalf) information about our Clients and  the individuals who represent our Clients, as described in this Part II.</p>
					    <h3 id="part2-1">1. COLLECTION AND USE OF BUSINESS CONTACT DATA</h3>
					    <p>The  individuals who represent Satmetrix's Clients or potential Clients  ("Business Contacts") may voluntarily provide their contact information  and related data (collectively "Business Contact Data") to Satmetrix by  various means, including telephone, email, postal mail, the "contact  us" or "download" page on the Satmetrix site, or other means.The  Business Contact Data submitted to Satmetrix is used to communicate  with and provide services for Clients and potential Clients. Satmetrix  will change, update or delete Business Contact Data when a request by  the applicable Business Contact is requested. To send a request please  fill out the <a href="./contact_us.php">contact request form</a> or send mail to Satmetrix Systems, Inc.; 2755 Campus Dr, Suite 300,  San Mateo, CA 94403 USA. We will respond to your request for access  within 30 days.</p>
					    <p>When a Business Contact accesses reports  through Satmetrix's servers, or otherwise uses the Satmetrix site, our  servers may place persistent cookies on the Business Contact's computer  in order to keep track of the Business Contact's personalized settings.</p>
					    <p>In  some cases, we use unique identifiers in email messages sent to  Business Contacts, which enable us to determine which emails have  generated responses. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of  certain communications and to exclude those Business Contacts who have  already responded to a certain message from duplicate messages.</p>
					    <p>Periodically,  we may have special offers that collect personal information. That  information would be used for the stated purpose and as consistent with  this privacy statement. These special offers include but are not  limited to promotional giveaways, newsletters and fact kits. Out of  respect for our users' privacy we provide a way to opt-out of our  newsletter and other promotional communications. Users may opt-out by  clicking on the unsubscribe link that's included in these  communications.</p>
					    <p>In addition to Business Contact Data,  Satmetrix may collect non-personally identifiable information  indirectly and automatically about visitors' use of the site, including  the web pages viewed on the site, the web page from which the visitor  linked to the site, the web page to which the visitor linked from the  site, and information about the browser the visitor is using (through,  for example, the use of "cookies" or the visitor's "IP address" (see  explanations in Part I.3 above)) about the visitor's activities on the  site. We use this browsing information for internal purposes such as to  help understand how the site is being used and to improve it, and for  systems administration purposes.</p>
					    <h4 id="part2-2">2. DISCLOSURE OF BUSINESS CONTACT DATA</h4>
					    <p>Generally,  Satmetrix does not provide Business Contact Data or other data to third  parties. Satmetrix may provide Business Contact Data or other data to  third parties to the extent such third parties provide operational  assistance (i.e., outsourced or third party services) to Satmetrix and  then only for that purpose. Satmetrix may share Business Contact Data  or other data with its corporate family, including its parent company,  subsidiaries, or other companies under common control with Satmetrix  for the same operational assistance.</p>
					    <h3 id="part3">PART III: GENERAL</h3>
					    <h4 id="part3-1">1. SECURITY MEASURES</h4>
					    <p>Satmetrix  uses industry-standard security measures to protect the integrity and  confidentiality of Business Contact Data as well as Personal Data it  processes on behalf of Clients, including, in appropriate  circumstances, the use of firewalls, restricted access, and encrypted  transmissions. Satmetrix limits access to Business Contact Data or  Personal Data to those persons in Satmetrix's organization who have a  business need to process such Business Contact Data or Personal Data.  However, no company, including Satmetrix, can fully eliminate the  security risks associated with such Business Contact Data or Personal  Data.</p>
					    <p>Due to factors beyond Satmetrix's control,  Satmetrix cannot ensure that Business Contact Data or Personal Data  will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, Satmetrix may  become legally obligated to disclose such data, or, despite  precautions, third parties may circumvent security measures to  intercept or access such data.</p>
					    <h4 id="part3-2">2. CORPORATE FAMILY AND SUCCESSORS</h4>
					    <p>If  another company acquires Satmetrix or substantially all of its assets,  that company will (a) succeed to ownership of the Business Contact Data  held by Satmetrix and will possess the Personal Data held by Satmetrix,  and (b) assume the rights and obligations regarding such Business  Contact Data and Personal Data described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
					    <h4 id="part3-3">3. QUESTIONS</h4>
					    <p>Questions, comments, or complaints about this Privacy Statement or Satmetrix's data practices please fill out the <a href="./contact_us.php">contact request form</a> or mailed to Satmetrix Systems, Inc.; 2755 Campus Dr, Suite 300, San Mateo, CA 94403 USA. We will respond to your request for access within  30 days.</p>
					    <p>Any questions, comments, or complaints about  the data practices (including without limitation compliance with the  data privacy principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, access,  security, data integrity, or enforcement) of a Satmetrix Client for  whom Satmetrix processes data, should be directed to that Client.</p>
					    <h4 id="part3-4">4. Notification of Changes</h4>
					    <p>If  we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to  this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem  appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we  collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we  disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy  policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are  going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner  different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify  users by posting a prominent notice on our Web site. If we make  material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or  by means of a notice on our homepage.</p>
					    <h4 id="part3-5">5. Choice / Opt-out</h4>
					    <p>We  provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally  identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for  this information. For example, if you request information but do not  wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can  indicate your preference on our <a href="./contact_us.php">contact form</a>.  If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, surveys or promotional  communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the  instructions included in each correspondence or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@satmetrix.com">privacy@satmetrix.com</a>.  In addition you may contact us at 650-227-8300 or by mail at 2755 Campus Dr, Suite 300 San Mateo, CA 94403. You will be notified when your  personal information is collected by any third party that is not our  agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to  whether or not to share your information with that party.</p>
					    <h4 id="part3-6">6. Legal Disclaimer</h4>
				      <p>We  reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information  as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to  protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court  order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>					    <h3>&nbsp;</h3></td>
