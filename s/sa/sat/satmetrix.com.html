        <h3> Effective Date: August 26, 2005</h3>
		<p>This Privacy Statement explains the data practices 
		of Satmetrix Systems, Inc. ("Satmetrix"

		</p>
		<div align="center"><b><a name="part1"></a>PART 
		I<br>
		PERSONAL DATA PROCESSED ON BEHALF OF SATMETRIX 
		CLIENTS</b></div>
		
		<p> As a general description of our data processing 
		services, Satmetrix collects (and analyzes) 
		survey responses from our clients' customers 
		who consent to be contacted or who have pre-existing 
		relationships with the Satmetrix client for 
		which Satmetrix is conducting a survey. As described 
		in this Part I, Satmetrix does not own the Personal 
		Data that we process.</p>
		<p><b>1.</b> SATMETRIX IS A DATA PROCESSOR<br>
		<br>
		Satmetrix processes, on behalf of its clients 
		(Satmetrix's "Clients"), Personal 
		Data that has been collected by or on behalf 
		of those Clients. "Personal Data" 
		means information relating to an identified 
		or identifiable person. Under the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" class="textlink" target="_blank">United 
		States/European Union Data Protection Safe Harbor 
		Arrangement</a> (the "Safe Harbor"), 
		Satmetrix acts as a Data Processor and each 
		Satmetrix Client acts as a Data Controller. 
		For the purposes of the Safe Harbor and this 
		Privacy Statement: a "Data Processor" 
		is an entity that processes Personal Data on 
		behalf of a Data Controller; a "Data Controller" 
		is an entity that determines the purposes for 
		which Personal Data are processed. To "process" 
		Personal Data means to carry out an operation 
		or set of operations on such Personal Data, 
		such as collecting, recording, storing, disclosing, 
		or organizing it. The "Data Subject" 
		means the person to whom a certain set of Personal 
		Data relate; for example, the person who responds 
		to a survey. 
		</p><p><b>2.</b> CLIENT INSTRUCTIONS <br>
		<br>
		As a Data Processor, Satmetrix will only process 
		Personal Data pursuant to the instructions of 
		the applicable Client. Satmetrix may use the 
		services of third party Data Processors to process 
		Personal Data in accordance with purposes identified 
		for such Personal Data by the applicable Client. 
		Subject to the foregoing sentence and <a href="#part3sec1" class="textlink">Section 
		1 of Part III</a> ("Security Measures") 
		below, Satmetrix will not transfer Personal 
		Data to a Third Party (which, for purposes of 
		this Privacy Statement, means an entity other 
		than Satmetrix and its applicable Client) without 
		instructions from the applicable Client. Satmetrix 
		will not be responsible for determining the 
		authenticity of any purported Data Subject's 
		request to access his or her Personal Data. 
		In the absence of express instructions to do 
		so from the applicable Client, Satmetrix will 
		not provide a purported Data Subject with access 
		to his or her Personal Data unless it is demonstrated 
		to Satmetrix's satisfaction that the applicable 
		Data Controller has refused such access.
		</p><p>Satmetrix does not review, comment upon, or 
		monitor its Clients' compliance with their respective 
		privacy policies, nor does Satmetrix review 
		Client instructions to determine whether they 
		are in compliance or conflict with the terms 
		of a Client's published privacy policy.
		</p><p><b><a name="part1sec3"></a>3.</b> PERSONAL 
		DATA COLLECTION<br>
		<br>
		Customer satisfaction surveys are initiated 
		to improve the processes and relationships between 
		our Clients and their customers. Typically a 
		Client's customers provide the Client with certain 
		information including their names, companies, 
		job titles, phone numbers, and email addresses 
		and the Client provides such information to 
		Satmetrix to enable us to process and analyze 
		surveys on behalf of the Client. In addition, 
		commercial list services may provide Satmetrix 
		with contact information for people who have 
		opted to receive email ("opt-in lists") 
		on specific topics of interest.
		</p><p>We invite Client customers - via email, telephone, 
		web page banners, web pop-ups, and other media 
		- to fill out surveys hosted on Satmetrix's 
		site (i.e., satmetrix.com, ccsurvey.com, or 
		any successor web site). Participation in these 
		surveys is voluntary. When a survey respondent 
		uses the Satmetrix site to fill out a survey, 
		our servers (which are hosted by a third party 
		service provider) may collect information indirectly 
		and automatically (through, for example, the 
		use of "cookies" or your "IP 
		address") about your activities on the 
		site while responding to the survey. We use 
		this browsing information, in non-personally 
		identifiable form, for internal purposes such 
		as to help understand how the site is being 
		used and to improve it, and for systems administration 
		purposes. We do not link the information we store in
		cookies to any personally identifiable information
		you submit while on our site.
		</p><p>Cookies are small pieces of information stored 
		on respondent's hard drive, not on our site. 
		Cookies allow us to better understand how respondents 
		use the site, which in turn helps us focus our 
		resources on improvements to the site. We use 
		session cookies, which expire when the browser 
		window is closed, and persistent cookies to 
		keep track of which survey(s) a particular respondent 
		has answered. A respondent is always free to 
		decline our cookies if her browser permits, 
		but in that case, the survey site may not operate 
		properly or a respondent may be prompted to 
		fill out the same survey multiple times at a 
		client's site. An IP address is a number that 
		is automatically assigned to a computer when 
		it is used on a network like the Internet. In 
		some cases the computer's IP address stays the 
		same from browser session to browser session; 
		but, for computers connecting to the Internet 
		via consumer Internet access providers, the 
		IP address generally varies from session to 
		session.
		</p><p>In some cases, we use unique identifiers in 
		email messages, which enable us to determine 
		which emails have generated responses. This 
		allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain 
		communications and to exclude those persons 
		who have already responded to a certain message 
		from duplicate messages.
		</p><p>Survey respondents may be required to submit 
		information such as a mailing address in order 
		receive a gift or other offering (if applicable).
		</p><p>In the email survey invitations we send, we 
		provide an opportunity for recipients to 'opt-out' 
		of receiving future email survey invitations 
		on behalf of the applicable Client.
		</p><p><b>4.</b> USE OF NORMATIVE DATA<br>
		<br>
		Satmetrix provides research services to its 
		Clients in which Satmetrix analyzes a Client's 
		customer performance data in comparison with 
		that of other companies in the same industry 
		as the Client ("Normative Research"). 
		However, Satmetrix does not process any Personal 
		Data in performing Normative Research: (a) Satmetrix 
		uses only non-Personal Data (i.e., data that 
		includes no personally identifiable information 
		or unique identifiers that could later be used 
		to refer to the personally identifiable information 
		to which the data was once associated) in performing 
		this Normative Research, and (b) Satmetrix discloses 
		only non-Personal Data in aggregate form ("Normative 
		Data") to its Clients who have requested 
		Normative Research.
		</p><p>
		</p><div align="center"><b><a name="part2"></a>PART 
		II<br>
		BUSINESS CONTACT INFORMATION</b></div>
		
		<p> In addition to the data we process on behalf 
		of our Clients, Satmetrix also processes (on 
		its own behalf) information about our Clients 
		and the individuals who represent our Clients, 
		as described in this Part II.</p>
		
<p><b>1.</b> COLLECTION AND USE OF BUSINESS CONTACT DATA<br>
            <br>
    The individuals who represent Satmetrix's Clients or potential Clients 
    ("Business Contacts") may voluntarily provide their contact 
            information and related data (collectively "Business Contact 
            Data") to Satmetrix by various means, including telephone, email, 
            postal mail, the "contact us" or "download" page 
            on the Satmetrix site, or other means.The Business Contact Data submitted to Satmetrix is used to communicate with and provide services for Clients and potential Clients. Satmetrix corrects or updates Business Contact Data when a request by the applicable Business Contact is requested.  To send a request please fill out the <a href="/company/privacyform.htm">privacy form</a> or mail to Satmetrix Systems, Inc.; 950 Tower Lane, Suite 500, Foster City, CA 94404 USA.  We will respond to your request for access within 30 days. 
          </p><p>When a Business Contact accesses reports through 
                                  Satmetrix's servers, or otherwise uses the Satmetrix 
                                  site, our servers may place persistent cookies 
                                  on the Business Contact's computer in order 
                                  to keep track of the Business Contact's personalized 
                                  settings.
</p><p>In some cases, we use unique identifiers in 
                                  email messages sent to Business Contacts, which 
                                  enable us to determine which emails have generated 
                                  responses. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness 
                                  of certain communications and to exclude those 
                                  Business Contacts who have already responded 
                                  to a certain message from duplicate messages.
</p><p>Periodically, we may have special offers that 
                                  collect personal information. That information 
                                  would be used for the stated purpose and as 
                                  consistent with this privacy statement. These 
                                  special offers include but are not limited to 
                                  promotional giveaways, newsletters and fact 
                                  kits. Out of respect for our users' privacy 
                                  we provide a way to opt-out of our newsletter 
                                  and other promotional communications. Users 
                                  may opt-out by clicking on the unsubscribe link 
                                  that's included in these communications.
</p><p>In addition to Business Contact Data, Satmetrix 
                                  may collect non-personally identifiable information 
                                  indirectly and automatically about visitors' 
                                  use of the site, including the web pages viewed 
                                  on the site, the web page from which the visitor 
                                  linked to the site, the web page to which the 
                                  visitor linked from the site, and information 
                                  about the browser the visitor is using (through, 
                                  for example, the use of "cookies" 
                                  or the visitor's "IP address" (see 
                                  explanations in <a href="#part1sec3" class="textlink">Part 
                                  I.3</a> above)) about the visitor's activities 
                                  on the site. We use this browsing information 
                                  for internal purposes such as to help understand 
                                  how the site is being used and to improve it, 
                                  and for systems administration purposes.
</p><p><b>2.</b> DISCLOSURE OF BUSINESS CONTACT DATA<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Generally, Satmetrix does not provide Business 
                                  Contact Data or other data to third parties. 
                                  Satmetrix may provide Business Contact Data 
                                  or other data to third parties to the extent 
                                  such third parties provide operational assistance 
                                  (i.e., outsourced or third party services) to 
                                  Satmetrix and then only for that purpose. Satmetrix 
                                  may share Business Contact Data or other data 
                                  with its corporate family, including its parent 
                                  company, subsidiaries, or other companies under 
                                  common control with Satmetrix for the same operational

                                  Satmetrix uses industry-standard security measures

                                  of Business Contact Data as well as Personal 
                                  Data it processes on behalf of Clients, including, 
                                  in appropriate circumstances, the use of firewalls, 
                                  restricted access, and encrypted transmissions. 
                                  Satmetrix limits access to Business Contact

                                  with such Business Contact Data or Personal

                                <p>Due to factors beyond Satmetrix's control, 
                                  Satmetrix cannot ensure that Business Contact

                                  to third parties. For example, Satmetrix may 
                                  become legally obligated to disclose such data, 
                                  or, despite precautions, third parties may circumvent 
                                  security measures to intercept or access such 
                                  data.</p>
