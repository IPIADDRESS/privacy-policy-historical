<html><head></head><body><h1>SailBlogs Privacy Policy</h1>
SailBlogs.com is firmly committed to protecting your privacy.
<p><strong>IP Address</strong><br>
When you register for an account, we may record your IP address for diagnostic purposes only.
</p><p><strong>Use of Email &amp; Mail Policy</strong> <br>
SailBlogs.com requires that members register with a valid email address to receive communication from SailBlogs.com regarding their membership. This email address - which must be valid - is used only for a reminder when payment is due, or to announce new SailBlogs.com features. We do not attempt to gather other demographics or any other information about you.
</p><p>SailBlogs.com and it parent webExpeditions LLC, and members of SailBlogs.com, use email in many ways to communicate to people who have expressed interest in receiving such communication. Certain components of the SailBlogs.com.com site may employ an auto responder to verify communication received through the web.
</p><p>Recurring lists (email newsletters, etc) are clearly marked with an opt-out link, though we encourage members to read these communications as they often have useful information about member services. We do not purchase or externally populate the email addresses in any list.
</p><p>Email to members of these lists will originate from the address autopilot at x-journal dot com or autopilot at SailBlogs.com dot com, and show that same address as a reply-to address. Replies to this address may be forwarded to the SailBlogs.com.com webmaster for review, but not necessarily. If for any reason an unsubscribe request fails or appears to fail, a note can be sent to support at SailBlogs.com dot com requesting to be removed from future mailings.
</p><p>SailBlogs.com or its parent webExpeditions LLC does not sell or rent any of these lists to any other party.
</p><p>It is not our intention to contribute to the problem of "spam", and all legitimate email originating from SailBlogs.com.com should be clearly marked with an unsubscribe option. Any issues encountered regarding receiving or being removed from one of our lists can be directed to support at SailBlogs.com dot com.
</p><p><strong>Online Advertisements</strong><br>
SailBlogs.com will not employ popup or popunder ads. Free sailblogs accounts are limited to utilizing templates which employ targeted advertising services provided by Google, Inc, webExpeditions LLC (SailBlogs parent company) and other third-party vendors (this is subject to change without notice). The design and placement of advertisements within these templates is subject to change at any time based on SailBlogs.com business needs. Users electing to have advanced memberships in SailBlogs.com can choose to employ advertising for their own purposes. <br>
