        <h2>Sailthru Industry Best Practices Notice</h2>
 		<div class="clearboth"></div>
       	<div class="copy">
			<p>Sailthru, Inc. ("Sailthru" or "we") has a no tolerance spam policy.  "Spam" means unsolicited communication to persons with whom client does not have a business relationship or who have not specifically requested (opted-in to) Customer’s mailing.</p>
			<p>A client’s account will be terminated if such client sends Spam. Please contact us immediately to report any suspected abuse.  Please forward the complete email in question, including headers.  If applicable, please also unsubscribe from the newsletter using the link at the bottom of the email if you no longer wish to receive emails from the sender.  We will take the appropriate action against the sender of the email in question.</p>
			<p>All users of our Service must agree to only sending permission-based email.  This means that all recipients sent to must have opted-in to receive communications from the sending organization.  The opt-in process requires that a potential user actively selects the products or services they are interested in and wish to subscribe to.</p>
			<p>An opt-in can occur either via a sign-up form on client’s web site, at a point-of-sale sign-up form, or on a physical sign-up sheet. Purchased lists may not be used within the Sailthru system, regardless of the source or permission status.</p>
			<p>As a user of Sailthru’s services, you may not:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>harvest emails from web sites</li>
			    <li>purchase lists (whether they are opt-in or not)</li>
			    <li>rent lists</li>
			   	<li>borrow or lend lists</li>
			    <li>have a subscription form that subscribes users to an unrelated list</li>
			    <li>send out unrelated offers or unrelated content to your newsletter list</li>
			    <li>add an email address into a list without the subscriber’s permission</li>
			<ul>
			<p>You may:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>send out a regular newsletter to a recipient who has opted-in to receive it</li>
			    <li>send out information and content to recipients who have requested to receive content on that topic from your organization</li>
			    <li>send out user triggered emails that result from actions carried out on your website</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Policy Enforcement</h4>
			<p>Sailthru has a no tolerance Spam policy. The strict measures we take to enforce our policy include, but are not limited to:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>We monitor use of the system for any large increases in sending emails</li>
			    <li>We utilize a content-checking utility to screen and flag any message that contains words common to unsolicited emails.</li>
			    <li>A record is saved of every email that is sent through the system.</li>
			    <li>Any customer found to be using Sailthru’s services for Spam will be immediately cut-off from use of the services.</li>
			    <li>We maintain the IP address and date subscribed for every new subscriber.</li>
			    <li>Every email, whether text or HTML, contains a mandatory unsubscribe/opt-out link at the bottom of the message. This unsubscribe link cannot be removed.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Procedure for Handling Complaints</h4>
			<p>Your account will be immediately terminated if we determine in our sole discretion that you send Spam. We provide our product only to those who follow our strict Anti-Spam Policy. Using the system to send out emails to addresses obtained in any way other than a subscriber opting-in to your list may incur a $100 (US) charge per substantiated incident (i.e. per email) in accordance with state and federal regulations.  If you cannot provide proof that these addresses were subscribed to the list, lack of proof is also considered a 'substantiated incident' and will incur a $100.00 (US) charge per incident.</p>
			<p>To determine whether you have sent spam we will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>review the content of the message in question
			    </li><li>review your subscriber list for patterns common to harvested lists
			    </li><li>review the Spam complaint
			    </li><li>view the records to see when the subscriber was subscribed and their IP address
			</li></ul>

    	<h2>Cookies and Other Technologies Used by Sailthru</h2>
    	<p>By using the Services, you agree that we can place cookies on your device, mobile platform or website as described in our&nbsp;Privacy Statement&nbsp;and this Cookie Notice.</p>
    	<h4>Automatic Information</h4>
    	<p>If you are a visitor on our Site or a user of our Service, we receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through the use of cookies and other similar technologies.  Sailthru automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Sailthru cookie information, and the page you requested.  Sailthru uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends, and administer the Site.  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies on our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you wish to deactivate cookies while visiting our site during your browsing session, please see “How to Control Cookies” below.  Please note that you may need to erase all cookies that have already been placed on your computer in order to delete the Sailthru cookie.
    	</p>
    	<p>“Traffic data” is information similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. This data is only used in the aggregate and enables us to figure out how often visitors use parts of the Site, so we can make the Site appealing to as many visitors as possible.
    	</p>
    	<p>We sometimes enter into partnerships or hire service providers to help us with our Site.  The use of cookies by these partners and service providers is not covered by our Privacy Statement.  We do not have access or control over these cookies. In addition, we may provide statistical information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our visitors use our Site.  We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use our Site.  Our third party partners employ images and scripts that help them better manage content on our Site.
    	</p>
    	<p>Sailthru may also use tracking technologies to collect information about your visit. These are small images or JavaScript embedded in web content and HTML-formatted email messages. Like cookies, this technology enables us to track pages and content accessed and viewed by users. Also, when we send HTML-formatted (as opposed to plain text) emails to users, this technology may be embedded in such emails. Using this approach allows us to determine whether emails have been opened or links were accessed, and identify aggregate trends, individual usage, and generate statistics about how a website is used. This enables us to provide our users with more relevant content or additional information about our services.
    	</p>
    	<h4>Third Party Advertising</h4>
    	<p>Everyone seems to be talking about advertising these days.  Of particular interest is third party advertising. We do not partner with third party advertisers and therefore there is no third party advertising on the Site.  If you are a visitor to our Site, we use cookies for our business purposes only (as discussed in the section on “Automatic Information” above).  
    	</p>
    	<h4>What We Do</h4>
    	<p>Sailthru partners with its Account Holders to analyze traffic and other end user activity on behalf of such Account Holders to improve their visitors’ experiences.  Sailthru may use web server log files and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information, such as cookies, IP addresses, device type and usage information including time spent on particular pages or number of clicks.</p>
    	<p>Like many service providers, Sailthru uses first-party cookies to report on visitor interactions. These cookies are used to identify the user session, such as whether the visitor has been to the site before.&nbsp;Browsers do not share first-party cookies across domains. We also use cookies to generate statistics about visitors to our Account Holders’ websites, such as the number of page views or times of peak traffic. If you don’t want your anonymous browser data to be collected by Sailthru when you visit sites that use Sailthru, you can see the section below entitled “How to Control Cookies”.</p>
    	<h4>How to Control Cookies</h4>
    	<p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct users on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies or delete cookies.  If you are a user, we strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of web business services.  All of our Account Holders must certify that their subscribers have opted-in to receive services; therefore, by disabling cookies you cannot take advantage of your subscriptions and their most attractive features.</p>
    	<p>For more detailed information on how to control cookies you may wish to visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>
    	</p>
    	<h4>Defined Terms</h4>
    	<p>All defined terms used in this Cookie Notice shall have the meaning ascribed to them in our Privacy Statement located at <a href="http://www.sailthru.com/legal#privacy_proposed">http://sailthru.com/legal</a>.

		<h4>Information Collected by Sailthru and How We Use It</h4>
		<p>We collect the following types of information from visitors to our Site, Account Holders or their subscribers:</p>
		<h5>Visitors to our Site</h5>
		<p>Visitors to our Site are not required to submit their information or register for an account.  However, we may collect information from you when you inquire about our services, post a comment to our blog, or apply for employment with us.  In these instances, we may collect your name, email address, phone number, physical address, company information and work history.  We will use this information to respond to your requests, send you email communications, or enable you to use features on our Site.</p>
		<h5>Account Holders</h5>
		<p>In order for you to view our Site, you are not required to register; however, you must register to take advantage of our products and services.  To register, you must create an account which requires you to provide your email address, a username and password, and information about your business (all registrants are deemed “Account Holders”).  We receive and store any information you enter on the Site or provide to us in any other way.  As an Account Holder, we request certain identifying information such as your email address, a username and password, information about your business and billing information.  Once you become an Account Holder, we will ask you for your list of subscriber names and email addresses (“Subscriber Data”).  All of this information is used for such purposes such as responding to your requests for services, onboarding, support to your account and communicating with you about new products and services.  This information is stored on our servers.  You are not permitted to access this information unless you are an Account Holder and no one is permitted to rent, sublicense, sell or distribute such information without our authorization. Sailthru’s use of Subscriber Data shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which we have been engaged, such as submitting email communications to your list of subscribers on your behalf (as discussed in the section on Email Communications below).</p>
		<h5>Subscribers</h5>
		<p>Sailthru offers its Account Holders an email monitoring and delivery service and an email authentication service.  On behalf of our Account Holders, we send out emails with news and/ or promotions, transaction receipts or account information.  We receive a confirmation when each Account Holder’s subscriber opens an email from Sailthru.  In addition, our services allow us to collect inferred data about the subscriber, which allows us to, among other things, personalize our Account Holder’s emails and personalize the subscriber’s experience while browsing the Account Holder’s website.
		</p>
		<p>  
			We provide our Account Holders with cookie technology so that they may use cookies on their websites in order to provide their users with website and email content that may be relevant to their interests. The cookies we provide our Account Holders collect traffic data and do not collect the Personally Identifiable Information of visitors to their websites.
		</p>
		<h4>Cookies and Other Technologies</h4>
		<p>
			We and our partners may use cookies and other technologies on our Site, platform, and as part of our service.  To learn more about the use of these technologies, please click here.
		</p>
		<h4>Disclosure of Information</h4>
		<p>
			The information obtained from visitors to our Site, our Account Holders, and their subscribers is an integral part of our business.  We neither rent nor sell your personal information or the Subscriber Data of our Account Holders to anyone. We share the information we collect only as described within this privacy statement.
		</p>
		<p>
			We may share your information:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>to other agents or service providers to perform tasks on our behalf.  Examples include analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service.  These third parties subscribe to the same level of privacy protection as we do.  Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
			</li>
			<li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process.
			</li>
			<li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
			</li>
			<li>if Sailthru is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,  you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
			</li>
			<li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Email Communications</h4>
		<p>If you do not wish to receive emails from Sailthru, please follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each communication or contact us at privacy@sailthru.com.
		</p>
		<h4>Access to Information</h4>
		<h5>Visitors to our Site and Account Holders</h5>
		<p>If your personal information changes, you may correct, update, delete, or ask to have it removed from our blog by contacting us via one of the methods listed below.  Account Holders may be able to make these changes within their account settings. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by sending an email to support@sailthru.com. Please note that some information may remain in our records after deletion of your account. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.
		</p>
		<h5>Subscribers</h5>
		<p>Sailthru has no direct relationship with the Account Holder’s subscribers whose data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to Sailthru’s Account Holder (the data controller). If the Account Holder requests Sailthru to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 business days.
		</p>	
		<h4>Data Retention</h4>
		<p>Sailthru will retain the data we collect on our Site, the data we collect through our Service, and the data we process on behalf of our Account Holders for as long as needed to provide our Services. Sailthru will retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
		<h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
		<p>"Personally Identifiable Information" means non-public, unencrypted data that identifies an individual.  For purposes of clarity, "unencrypted data" means public release of a name or alias, email addresses or financial account information in combination with any password or security code, social security number, passport number, driver’s license number, taxpayer identification number or credit card number(s) that any person may retrieve without permission or authorization.  The definition of what is Personally Identifiable Information varies depending on the laws of the state or country in which you reside.</p>
		<h4>Information Your Subscribers Might Want to Know: </h4>
		<p>We may obtain personal information from our Account Holders and their subscribers. Sailthru only discloses personal information to Account Holders who engage Sailthru to process data on their behalf and have received the appropriate consent.  Due to the global nature of services provided by Sailthru, the personal information you provide may be transmitted, used, stored and otherwise processed outside of the country where you submitted that information, including jurisdictions that may not have data privacy laws that provide equivalent protection to such laws in your home country.</p>
		<h4>Security Technology</h4>
		<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personally Identifiable Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. If you enter Personally Identifiable Information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link: http://www.thawte.com/resources/ssl-information-center/get-started-with-ssl/index.html.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
		<h4>Liability Limitation</h4>
		<p>In no case whatsoever will Sailthru’s liability exceed the amount of monies paid for services nor will Sailthru be liable for indirect, special, or consequential damages of any kind to any party. 
		</p>
		<h4>Other Information</h4>
		<h5>Links to Third Party Sites</h5>
		<p>Our services include links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Sailthru. If you submit any of your own data to any of those sites, your data is governed by their privacy statements.  We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.
		</p>
		<h5>Blog</h5>
		<p>Our website offers publicly accessible blogs. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

		<h5>Testimonials</h5>
		<p>With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name.  You can request the deletion of your testimonial by contacting us via one of the methods listed below.
		</p>
		<h5>Co-branded sites</h5>

		</p>
		<h5>Social Media Widgets</h5>
		<p id="privacy_social_widgets">Our website includes Social Media Features, such as the Like button.  These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

		<h5>Single Sign-On</h5>
		<p>You can log in to our site using an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.&nbsp; Services like these give you the option to post information about your activities on this website to your profile page to share with others within your network.&nbsp; &nbsp;
		</p>
		<h4>Privacy Statement Changes</h4>
		<p>If this privacy statement changes in the future, we will provide notice by posting such notice on the Site. By continuing to use the Site and our services after such notice has been posted, you will be deemed to have accepted the changes.  If you do not agree to the changes, you have the option to terminate your account and have your data removed from our system.
