• <b>E-mail communications</b>: to help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from MBL Group PLC if your computer supports such capabilities.

<b>Security</b><br><br>

We are committed to using our best efforts to maintaining the security of your personal information and we do this in a number of ways: 
<br><br>

• we work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. <br>
• we reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.<br>
• we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. 
<br>
<br>
It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.  <br><br>
Although we use our best efforts to protect the security of your personal information and our system, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, no transmission via the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result of this and other factors beyond our control, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you transmit to or through our Website. Therefore, you assume that risk by using the Website. 
<br>
