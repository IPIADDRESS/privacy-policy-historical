Unless we are informed otherwise, we will continue to use the information collected in this manner. Accuracy of information is important to us and changes or corrections to information held will be welcomed at any time. <br><br>Normally we collect information from the persons concerned and they are under no obligation to provide it. However without certain information we may be unable to provide the products and services, or facilitate the preferred payment method. Most personal information is stored in-house. In some cases, such as certain web-based services that are contracted out, necessary contractual measures are taken to protect this information. <br><br>All reasonable steps are taken to protect the security of the personal information held, be it stored in electronic or hard copy form. Except for the reasons given in the NPPs, access is available to the person whose information is held, subject to the payment of reasonable expenses incurred in extracting such information. Access to personal information can be arranged by contacting: <br><br>The Chief Privacy Officer <br><br>PO Box 5420 <br><br>SYDNEY NSW 2001 <br><br>Ph: (02) 8206 6000 <br><br>Fax: (02) 8206 6001 <br><br>Email: <a href="mailto:privacy.officer@sai-global.com">privacy.officer@sai-global.com</a> </p>

All staff undertake training on privacy and the person receiving the complaint will attempt to resolve the complaint, forwarding information on actions taken to the Chief Privacy Officer.
