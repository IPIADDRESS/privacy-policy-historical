                          <h1><strong>Your Privacy</strong></h1>
					      <p>At SailPoint Technologies, Inc. ("SailPoint"), we are
					        committed to respecting your Privacy. We recognize that when you
					        choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust
					        us to act in a responsible manner and to protect and safely manage
					        any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information")
					        that you share with us.</p>
					      <p>Personal Information means any information that may be used to
					        identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and
					        last name, a physical address and an email address or other contact
					        information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit
					        SailPoint's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing
					        any Personal Information about yourself.</p>
					      <p>If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the
					        Web, we may transfer that Information within SailPoint or to SailPoint's
					        third-party service providers, across borders and from your country
					        or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.</p>
					      <p>SailPoint strives to comply with all applicable laws around the
					        globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal
					        requirements may vary from country to country, SailPoint intends
					        to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy
					        even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal
					        Information from your country to countries that may not require
					        an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information.
					        In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal
					        Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected,
					        transferred, or retained.</p>
					      <p>Where the information originates from a country in the European
					        Union, SailPoint agrees to comply with all the provisions of the
					        U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Framework and makes an affirmative commitment
					        to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles, which can be found at <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank"><u>http://export.gov/safeharbor</u></a>.<br>
					        <br>

					      <h2><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></h2>
					      <p>From time to time, some of our Web pages may utilize "cookies" and
					        other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text
					        file that may be used, for example, to collect information about
					        Web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve
					        to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user.
					        Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or
					        not to accept them and how to remove them. </p>
					      <p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie,
					        or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please
					        note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will
					        need to re-enter your original information (i.e., user name, password
					        or general contact info) to gain access to certain parts of the
					        Web site.</p>
					      <p>Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain
					        and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software
					        and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and
					        times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking
					        technologies allows us to improve our Web site and your Web experience.
					        We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information
					        for trends and statistics.<br>
					        <br>
					      </p>
					      <h2><strong>Privacy Principles</strong></h2>
					      <p>SailPoint's Online Privacy Policy consists of the following principles: </p>
					      <p><strong>Notice</strong><br>
					      Where SailPoint collects Personal Information on the web, we intend
					        to post a purpose statement that explains why Personal Information
					        will be collected and whether we plan to share such Personal Information
					        outside of SailPoint or those working on SailPoint's behalf. SailPoint
					        does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent
					        to third parties who are not bound to act on SailPoint's behalf
					        unless such transfer is legally required. </p>
					      <p><strong>Choice</strong><br>
					      You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to
					        SailPoint. The notice we intend to provide where SailPoint collects
					        Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice.
					        If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request,
					        you can still visit most of SailPoint's Web site pages, but you
					        may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that
					        involve our interaction with you. </p>
					      <p>If you chose to have a relationship with SailPoint, such as a contractual
					        or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally
					        continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.</p>
					      <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
					      Wherever your Personal Information may be held within SailPoint
					        or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps
					        to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from
					        unauthorized access or disclosure. SailPoint trains its employees
					        on our privacy policy guidelines and makes our privacy policy available
					        to our business partners. In addition, SailPoint and its business
					        partners enter into confidentiality agreements which require that
					        care and precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure
					        of your personal information.</p>
					      <p><strong>Access/Accuracy</strong><br>
					      To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information,
					        SailPoint wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where
					        we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, our goal is
					        to provide a means of contacting SailPoint should you need to update
					        or correct that Information. If for any reason those means are unavailable
					        or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your
					        Personal Information to <a href="mailto:privacy@sailpoint.com" target="_blank">privacy@sailpoint.com</a> and
					        we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your
					        Personal Information that we hold as soon as practicable. </p>
					      <p><strong>Third Party Services</strong><br>
					      Third parties provide certain services available on SailPoint.com
					        on SailPoint's behalf. SailPoint may provide information, including
					        Personal Information, that SailPoint collects on the Web to third-party
					        service providers to help us deliver programs, products, information,
					        and services. Service providers are also an important means by which
					        SailPoint maintains its Web site and mailing lists. SailPoint will
					        take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers
					        are obligated to protect Personal Information on SailPoint's behalf. </p>
					      <p>SailPoint does not intend to transfer Personal Information without
					        your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on SailPoint's
					        behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is
					        against SailPoint's policy to sell Personal Information collected
					        online without consent.</p>
					      <p><strong>Inquiries and Suggestions</strong><br>
					      If you require any further information or if you have any questions
					        or concerns about our privacy policies and procedures, please contact
					        us at:</p>

					      <p>We will investigate all the concerns we receive and take appropriate
					        measures to ensure that our practices are as stated in this Privacy
					        Statement.&nbsp;<br>
					        &nbsp;<br>
				          </p>
					      <p><strong>Safe Harbor Data Privacy Policy</strong><br>
					      SailPoint is a global corporation and has developed global data
					        practices designed to assure personal information is appropriately
					        protected. Not only do we strive to collect, use and disclose personal
					        information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries
					        in which we do business, but we also aim to uphold the highest ethical
					        standards in our business practices. This Safe Harbor Data Privacy
					        Policy outlines our general policy and practices for implementing
					        the Safe Harbor Principles. If there is any conflict between this
					        policy and the Safe Harbor Principles, the Safe Harbor Principles
					        will govern.</p>
					      <p>This notice applies to all personal information we handle, including
					        on-line (except as noted below), off-line, and manually processed
					        data. For purposes of this notice, "personal information"   means
					        data that: (i) is transferred from the European Union to the United
					        States; (ii) is recorded in any form; and (iii) is about, or pertains
					        to, a specific individual who is identified in, or is identifiable
					        from, the data.</p>
					      <p>"Sensitive information" is a subcategory of personal
					        information. Sensitive information is defined as personal information
					        specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin,
					        political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union
					        membership, or the sex life of the individual. Sensitive information
					        also includes personal information received from a third party where
					        the third party treats and identifies it as sensitive.</p>
					      <p><strong>Safe Harbor&nbsp;</strong><br>
					        
					      The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission
					        have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently
					        asked questions (the "Safe Harbor Principles") to enable
					        U.S. companies to satisfy European Union law requirements for adequate
					        protection of personal information transferred from the E.U. to
					        the U.S. SailPoint's privacy practices are self-certified with the
					        United States Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program. SailPoint
					        has chosen to cooperate with the European Union Data Protection
					        Authorities for unresolved privacy complaints. For more information
					        about Safe Harbor or to access SailPoint's certification statement,
					        go to <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank"><u>http://export.gov/safeharbor/</u></a>. </p>
					      <p><strong>Privacy Principles</strong><br>
                          The following privacy principles are based on the Safe Harbor Principles.&nbsp;<br>
					        &nbsp;<br>
					        <strong>Notice and Choice</strong><br>
                            To the extent permitted by the Safe Harbor Principles, SailPoint
					        reserves the right to process personal information in the course
					        of providing professional services to our clients without the knowledge
					        of individuals involved. Where we collect personal information directly
					        from individuals in the E.U., we inform them about the types of
					        personal information we collect from them, the purposes for which
					        we collect and use it, and the types of non-agent third parties
					        to which we disclose that information. We also inform those individuals
					        about the choices and means, if any, we offer individuals for limiting
					        the use or disclosure of their information. &nbsp;<br>
					        &nbsp;<br>
				          </p><p><strong>Disclosures and Transfers</strong><br>
                            SailPoint will not disclose an individual's personal information
					        to third parties, except when one or more of the following conditions
					        is true: </p>
					      <ul type="disc">
                            <li>We have the individual's permission to make the
                              disclosure; </li>
					        <li>The disclosure is required by law or professional standards; </li>
					        <li>The disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or disposition
					          of all or part of our business; </li>
					        <li>The information in question is publicly available; </li>
					        <li>The disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment
					          or defense of legal claims; or </li>
					        <li>The disclosure is to another SailPoint entity or to persons
					          or entities providing services on our or the individual's behalf
					          (each a "transferee"), consistent with the purpose for
					          which the information was obtained, if the transferee, with respect
					          to the information in question:
					          <ul type="disc">
                                  <li>is subject to law providing an adequate
                                    level of privacy protection; </li>
					            <li>has agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy
					              protection; or </li>
					            <li>subscribes to the Safe Harbor Principles. </li>
				              </ul>
				            </li>
				          </ul>
					      <p>Permitted transfers of information, either to third parties or
					        within SailPoint, include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction
					        to another, including transfers to and from the United States of
					        America. Because privacy laws vary from one jurisdiction to another,
					        personal information may be transferred to a jurisdiction where
					        the laws provide less or different protection than the jurisdiction
					        in which the information originated.</p>
					      <p><strong>Data Security</strong><br>
                          To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy,
					        and ensure the appropriate use and confidentiality of information,
					        either for its own purposes or on behalf of our clients, SailPoint
					        has appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures
					        to safeguard and secure the information we process. However, we
					        cannot guarantee the security of information on or transmitted via
					        the Internet. </p>
					      <p><strong>Data Integrity</strong><br>
                          SailPoint processes personal information only in ways compatible
					        with the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized
					        by the individual. To the extent necessary for such purposes, we
					        take reasonable steps to make sure that personal information is
					        accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable with regard
					        to its intended use. </p>
					      <p><strong>Access and Correction</strong><br>
                          If an individual becomes aware that information we maintain about
					        that individual is inaccurate, or if an individual would like to
					        update or review his or her information, the individual may contact
					        us using the contact information below. We will take reasonable
					        steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information
					        that is demonstrated to be inaccurate. The individual will need
					        to provide sufficient identifying information, such as name, address,
					        birth date, and social security number. We may request additional
					        identifying information as a security precaution. In addition, we
					        may limit or deny access to personal information where providing
					        such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the
					        circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Principles. </p>
					      <p><strong>Enforcement and Dispute Resolution</strong><br>
                          SailPoint utilizes a self-assessment program to monitor our compliance
					        to the Safe Harbor Principles and to address questions and concerns
					        regarding our compliance. This program will include a statement,
					        at least once a year, signed by our authorized representative, verifying
					        our adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles. We encourage interested
					        persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact information
					        below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and
					        disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in
					        accordance with the principles contained in this policy.</p>
					      <p>With respect to any complaints relating to this policy that cannot
					        be resolved through our internal processes, we have agreed to participate
					        in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by
					        the European Union Data Protection Authorities to resolve disputes
					        pursuant to the Safe Harbor Principles. In the event that we or
					        such authorities determine that we did not comply with this policy,
					        we will take appropriate steps to address any adverse effects and
					        to promote future compliance. </p>
					      <p>Any person who we determine is in violation of our privacy policies
					        will be subject to disciplinary procedures. </p>
					      <p><strong>Amendment</strong><br>
                          We may amend this policy from time to time by posting a revised
					        policy on this Web site, or a similar Web site that replaces this
					        Web site. If we amend the policy, the new policy will apply to personal
					        information previously collected only insofar as the rights of the
					        individual affected are not reduced. So long as we profess to adhere
					        to the Safe Harbor Principles, we will not amend this policy in
					        a manner inconsistent with the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>
