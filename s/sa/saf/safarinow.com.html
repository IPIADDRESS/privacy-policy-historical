<p>8.9&nbsp;&nbsp;Once SafariNow.com has achieved the purpose for the collection of the User’s personal information, it will destroy or delete such information, unless the User has directed otherwise in writing, or SafariNow.com is required by law to retain the information for a longer period of time.</p>
