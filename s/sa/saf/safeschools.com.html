We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to take care when providing information in public areas of our Websites like message boards, which any website visitor can view.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to our Websites. Any transmission of personal data is at your own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on our Websites.</p>
<p><strong>DOES VECTOR SOLUTIONS USE LINKS TO OTHER INTERNET WEBSITES?</strong></p>
<p>As part of our routine business operations, our Websites contain links to third party websites, plug-ins, services, social networks or applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow the third party to collect or share data about you. Vector Solutions does not control these third-party websites, and we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit, as its privacy policy may differ substantially from that of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS VECTOR SOLUTIONS’ CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY?</strong></p>
<p>With respect to minors,&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.vectorsolutions.com/">www.VectorSolutions.com</a></u>&nbsp;and any of our Websites are not intended to be accessed or utilized by persons under the age of 18, except as provided in<strong>‌ </strong>the Vector Solutions Privacy Policy for Children Under the Age of 13 Section below. We do not specifically market to children under 13. Vector Solutions does not intend or purposefully attempt to gather information from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>The following applies to Scenario Learning, LLC Clients only:</p>
<p><strong>FERPA&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Scenario Learning, LLC and its Clients are subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). As such, Scenario Learning, LLC acknowledges that: (a) Scenario Learning, LLC and its Clients are each providing educational services to the other that they would otherwise have to provide for themselves using faculty and staff; (b) each&nbsp; has a legitimate educational interest in the student education records that may be disclosed; and (c) Scenario Learning, LCC will be under the direct control of each Client User with respect to the use and maintenance of information from student education records. Scenario Learning, LLC acknowledges that the student education record it may receive is confidential and will use the information only for the purposes for which the disclosure was made. Scenario Learning, LLC&nbsp;will not re-disclose the information to any third party without prior written consent from the student and client. Scenario Learning, LLC works together with its Clients to share student education records in a manner that protects such records from disclosure.</p>
<p>The following applies to Not Anymore Client and Client’s Users only:</p>
<p><strong>Limited Reporting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the security provided by the Client/Server technical design, Scenario Learning, LLC has a feature designed to prevent Not Anymore Client users from uniquely identifying the personal data from any individual user. For each Client (e.g., each school), an administrator is provided with access to an online portal that provides information about that Client’s User’s progress. The administrator has access to a Progress Report, which includes user-specific information as discussed above. Not Anymore Clients have access to a raw data report that includes all of the de-identified data. The de-identified data does not become available to the Client until at least 100 men and 100 women have completed the program. In addition, each time the full raw data report is opened the information is randomized. These protections ensure that a Client is not able to review the Users that have completed the program each day and try to match it up with data in the raw data report, thereby identifying the personal data from any individual User. Should a Not Anymore Client not meet the 100 men and 100 women minimum, they are not provided access to the raw data until after all Not Anymore Client Users have completed the program, and if the number of completions is still too low at that time, either the demographic data is removed from the raw data file altogether or with very small populations, the raw data is not provided at all.</p>
<p><strong>Vector Solutions Privacy Policy for Children Under the Age of 13 – </strong><strong>safeschools alert service and </strong><strong>SafeSchools Alert Mobile Application</strong></p>
<p>‌Vector Solutions’ general website and Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, however, we are committed to protecting children who make use of our SafeSchools Alert Service or SafeSchools Alert Mobile Application for reporting, managing, tracking and resolving incidents in compliance with applicable regulations in our efforts to keep children safe.</p>
<p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, “COPPA”) require us to inform parents and legal guardians (as used in this Section of our Privacy Policy), (“<strong>parents</strong>”) about our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information from children under the age of 13</p>
<p>(”<strong>children</strong>”). It also requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child’s parent for certain collection, use, and disclosure of the child’s personal information. Children may access and use our SafeSchools Alert Mobile App to track, manage and resolve incidents in our web-based system.</p>
<p>This Section only applies to children under the age of 13 and supplements and is a part of the general Vector Solutions Privacy Policy. Only our general Privacy Policy applies to teens and adults.</p>
<p>Terms that are defined in the Vector Solutions Privacy Policy have the same meanings as used in this Section for Children Under the Age of 13.</p>
<p><strong><u>Information We Collect from Children</u></strong></p>
<p>Your child’s School District has chosen to make the Safe Schools Alert Service and associated SafeSchools Alert Mobile Application (the “App”) available to its students (collectively referred to in this Section as the “Service”). Based on the School Districts’ authorization, this Service is made available on the premise that the School District has obtained any requisite parental consent. Children can access many parts of the SafeSchools Alert Service via the Mobile Application and our Website and they can use its tip and incident reporting feature anonymously and without providing us with any personal information. We do not require sensitive or otherwise protected data about the user however, we have no way to restrict users from entering information in the free form text areas of the App or via the Website. While children may voluntarily include personal information when they visit our Website or use the App to report an incident, Vector Solutions has no control over this. If the child chooses to share personally identifiable information when submitting a tip or reporting an incident, such information will be shared with the School District.</p>
<p>We only collect as much information about a child as is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in providing a tip or reporting an incident, and we do not condition his or her participation on the disclosure of any personal information or other information than is reasonably necessary. Your child, at his or her option, can elect to remain anonymous. The App only allows users to communicate with their School District’s administration and DOES NOT allow users to communicate with each other.</p>
<p><strong><u>Information We Collect Directly</u></strong>. When first using the App, a child will be requested to provide us with the Organization Code provided by the child’s School District and the child’s confirmation that he/she is associated with the School District.</p>
<p>When your child uses the App, we may automatically collect information such as the IP address, browser type, operating system and device/hardware, general location and other log in information, including the date and time of any reports made through the App.</p>
<p><strong><u>Automatic Information Collection and Tracking</u></strong>. We use technology to automatically collect information from our users, including children, when they access and navigate through the App or the Website and use certain of its features. The information we collect through these technologies may include a unique identification for the user’s device for installation of the App and the tip or report data provided by the user.</p>
<p><strong><u>How We Use Your Child’s Information</u></strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect from your child to transmit the incident report to your child’s School District by an “anonymous user” unless the child has elected to include personal information. Your child may voluntarily provide information in a report or when using the Service or the App, that allows the School District to identify them, but the Service and the App do not require or encourage children to provide personal information. Any information provided by the child is used to manage, track, and resolve reported incidents for the purpose of keeping children safe.</p>
<p><strong><u>Our Practices for Disclosing Children’s Information</u></strong></p>
<p>We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer children’s personal information other than as described in this section.</p>
<p>We may disclose aggregated information about many of our users, and information that does not identify any individual or device. In addition, we may disclose children’s personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we are required to do so by law or legal process, such as to comply with any court order or subpoena or to respond to any government or regulatory request.</li>
<li>If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Vector Solutions, our customers or others, including to:</li>
<li>protect the safety of a child;</li>
<li>protect the safety and security of the App or our Services or</li>
<li>enable us to take precautions against liability.</li>
<li>To law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if Vector Solutions is involved in a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Vector Solutions’ assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding or event, we may transfer the personal information we have collected or maintain to the buyer or other successor.</p>
<p>‌<strong><u>Accessing and Correcting Your Child’s Personal Information</u></strong></p>
<p>The Service and the App are designed to be used anonymously so parents may not be able to review reports. If the child has voluntarily submitted personal information as part of a report, parents may contact the School District directly to review such information. Parents have the right to refuse to permit further use or collection of their child’s personal information.</p>
<p>You may contact your child’s School District Administrators directly if you have any questions regarding how your child’s data is collected and used or if you would like to correct or remove your child’s information or to change or withdraw your consent to use such information.</p>
