You know you don\u0027t want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns--the lessons learned by those who\u0027ve faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on...something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun. You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don\u0027t just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look \u0022in the wild\u0022. In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java\u0027s built-in pattern support in your own code. You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead). You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you\u0027re up a creek without a design pattern. Most importantly, you want to learn the \u0022secret language\u0022 of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You\u0027ll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn\u0027t as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter. With Head First Design Patterns, you\u0027ll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the \u0022Trading Spaces\u0022 show. Best of all, in a way that won\u0027t put you to sleep! We think your time is too important (and too short) to spend it struggling with academic texts. If you\u0027ve read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, Head First Design Patterns will load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks. In a way that lets you put them to work immediately. In a way that makes you better at solving software design problems, and better at speaking the language of patterns with others on your team.","htmldescription":{"p":"\n        You\u0027re not alone.\n        At any given moment, somewhere in the world someone struggles with\n        the same software design problems you have.

The fact is your brain craves novelty. It\u0027s constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that\u0027s the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won\u0027t interfere with your brain\u0027s real work--recording things that matter.

It\u0027s fast, it\u0027s fun, and it\u0027s effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java.

And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform.

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that\u0027s more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: SyntaxObjectsFunctionsInheritanceArraysRegular expressionsMethodsStyleBeautiful featuresThe real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you\u0027ll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you\u0027ll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you\u0027re managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

	<li>
		<strong>Information We Collect</strong>
		<p>Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") means information that can be directly associated with you (such as your name, email address, telephone number or billing information), or information about activities directly linked to you (such as subscriptions that you have licensed or purchased). We collect PII in the following ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>1.1 Information that you provide to us directly:</strong>
				<p>When you contact or communicate with Safari, we may gather information such as your name, physical address, email address and phone number.</p>
				<p>When you participate in a promotional offer (such as a trial subscription) and/or purchase products or services, we may gather information regarding the offer that you participate in, and any products or services that you purchase, as well as financial information such as your credit card number.</p>
				<p>When you register for an online account, subscribe to a newsletter, participate in communities or an event, program, class or promotion, or click on a URL, we may gather user preferences, product interests, industry focus, community choices and other customer profile information.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>1.2 Information we collect through technology related to our products and services:</strong></p>
				<p>Certain products and services that you acquire from us may connect and transmit telemetry and system/product data to us or our authorized agents. This data may include, but is not limited to, system model, operating system, host ID and IP address.</p>
				<p>We use this information to manage and administer our products and services, and as the basis for advising you of the availability of updates and new versions, providing agreed upon testing and monitoring of services that we provide, enhancing our products and services, and improving and targeting our communications with you.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>1.3 Information we collect through online technology:</strong></p>
				<p>When you are on Safari's websites, we collect information about the pages you visit. Some web pages use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to automatically collect information from you. We send one or more cookies (small text files containing a string of characters) to your computer to uniquely identify your browser. We use "web beacons" (electronic images also known as pixel tags or clear gifs) to recognize a Safari cookie on your computer when you view or act upon a Safari web page , a Safari advertisement posted on a third-party web page, or open an email from us.</p>
				<p>Cookies, web beacons and similar technologies enable us to collect information about your visits to our websites, such as:</p>
				<blockquote>
					Internet Protocol Address<br>
					Browser type<br>
					Operating system<br>
					Referring site (site you visited before coming to our site)<br>
					Date and time of visit<br>
					URL of pages visited<br>
					Other browsing behavior, such as products and white papers downloaded</blockquote>
				<p style="margin-top:12px;">Our third party web analytics service providers use cookies and web beacons in order to make it easier for you to navigate our site and to help us manage the content on our site by informing us what content is effective. These technologies are not tied to our customers' PII and we do not have control over these features.</p>
				<p>Most browsers allow you to remove and block cookies and web beacons. If you do so, you will need to re-enter your User Name and password to access certain parts of our web sites and you will be served only generic information that is not focused on your specific interests. Also, you may not be able to use certain Safari web site features or take full advantage of our offerings.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>1.4 Information from other sources:</strong></p>
				<p>From time-to-time we may receive information from other sources, such as commercial contact lists or companies that we acquire, and we may combine that information with information previously collected.</p>
				<p>If you give us PII on behalf of someone else (or someone else gives us PII on your behalf), we require that the person providing the PII to us must have consent to do so from the person whose information is provided. To request the removal of your PII, whether it was provided by you, by a friend, or by a third party marketing company, please see the "Access and Accuracy" section below.</p>
				<p>Some Safari events, web sites or services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with a third party. When you provide PII in relation to them, both Safari and the third party(ies) may receive the information collected and use the information according to each company's privacy policy and agreement with you. We recommend reading the privacy statement of our co-branded partners as well, if you are accessing our services through a co-branded offering.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>How We Use Information We Collect</strong>
		<p>We use PII to conduct business, provide information and support for products and services, improve our understanding of your needs and interests, develop and improve our services and products, and personalize communications. Examples include:</p>
		<p>Advising you of relevant promotions, products, services, and news about Safari and affiliated third-parties</p>
		<blockquote>
			Processing and fulfilling orders<br>
			Creating and monitoring accounts<br>
			Market research projects<br>
			Analyzing how our products and services are used<br>
			Personalizing content and advertising<br>
			Monitoring our services in order to prevent and identify unauthorized content use and violations of our end user agreements<br>
			Planning and forecasting<br>
			Legal compliance<br>
			Preventing fraud and prohibited or illegal activities</blockquote>

	<li>
		<strong>How We Share and Disclose PII</strong>

			<li>
				As necessary, if we suspect a violation of our policies or to protect the rights or safety of any person or entity</li>
			<li>

	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Security</strong>
		<p>Safari uses administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of PII against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

Please note that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
