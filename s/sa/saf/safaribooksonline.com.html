The book makes no assumptions about prior experience with object-oriented programming languages or with the C language (which Objective-C is based upon). Because of this, both beginners and experienced programmers alike can use this book to quickly and effectively learn the fundamentals of Objective-C. Readers can also learn the concepts of object-oriented programming without having to first learn all of the intricacies of the underlying C programming language. This unique approach to learning, combined with many small program examples and exercises at the end of each chapter, makes Programming in Objective-C ideally suited for either classroom use or self-study. This edition has been fully updated to incorporate new features in Objective-C programming introduced with Xcode 4.4 (OS X Mountain Lion) and Xcode 4.5 (iOS 6.) \u201cThe best book on any programming language that I\u2019ve ever read.

Advocates of NoSQL databases claim they can be used to build systems that are more performant, scale better, and are easier to program. NoSQL Distilled is a concise but thorough introduction to this rapidly emerging technology. Pramod J. Sadalage and Martin Fowler explain how NoSQL databases work and the ways that they may be a superior alternative to a traditional RDBMS. The authors provide a fast-paced guide to the concepts you need to know in order to evaluate whether NoSQL databases are right for your needs and, if so, which technologies you should explore further. The first part of the book concentrates on core concepts, including schemaless data models, aggregates, new distribution models, the CAP theorem, and map-reduce. In the second part, the authors explore architectural and design issues associated with implementing NoSQL. They also present realistic use cases that demonstrate NoSQL databases at work and feature representative examples using Riak, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4j. In addition, by drawing on Pramod Sadalage\u2019s pioneering work, NoSQL Distilled shows how to implement evolutionary design with schema migration: an essential technique for applying NoSQL databases. The book concludes by describing how NoSQL is ushering in a new age of Polyglot Persistence, where multiple data-storage worlds coexist, and architects can choose the technology best optimized for each type of data access.","htmldescription":{"p":["The need to handle increasingly larger data\nvolumes is one factor driving the adoption of a new class of\nnonrelational \u201cNoSQL\u201d databases.

			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>1.2 Information we collect through technology related to our products and services:</strong>

			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>1.3 Information we collect through online technology:</strong>
				<p>When you are on Safari's websites, we collect information about the pages you visit. Some web pages use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to automatically collect information from you. We send one or more cookies (small text files containing a string of characters) to your computer to uniquely identify your browser. We use "web beacons" (electronic images also known as pixel tags or clear gifs) to recognize a Safari cookie on your computer when you view or act upon a Safari web page , a Safari advertisement posted on a third-party web page, or open an email from us.</p>
				<p>Cookies, web beacons and similar technologies enable us to collect information about your visits to our websites, such as:</p>
				<p>Our third party web analytics service providers use cookies and web beacons in order to make it easier for you to navigate our site and to help us manage the content on our site by informing us what content is effective. These technologies are not tied to our customers' PII and we do not have control over these features.</p>
				<p>Most browsers allow you to remove and block cookies and web beacons. If you do so, you will need to re-enter your User Name and password to access certain parts of our web sites and you will be served only generic information that is not focused on your specific interests.

Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

				<strong>1.4 Information from other sources:</strong>
				<p>From time-to-time we may receive information from other sources, such as commercial contact lists or companies that we acquire, and we may combine that information with information previously collected.</p>
				<p>If you give us PII (as defined in Section 1) on behalf of someone else (or someone else gives us PII on your behalf), we require that the person providing the PII to us must have consent to do so from the person whose information is provided. To request the removal of your PII, whether it was provided by you, by a friend, or by a third party marketing company, please see the "Access and Accuracy" section below.</p>
				<p>Some Safari events, web sites or services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with a third party. When you provide PII in relation to them, both Safari and the third party(ies) may receive the information collected and use the information according to each company's privacy policy and agreement with you. We recommend reading the privacy statement of our co-branded partners as well, if you are accessing our services through a co-branded offering.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>How We Use Information We Collect</strong>

		<ul>
