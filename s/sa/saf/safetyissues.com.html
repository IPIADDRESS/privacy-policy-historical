                  </p>
                  <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of
                  the users of our site.</p>
                  <p>This privacy policy will advise you about how we protect
                  your personal information, and about what choices you have
                  concerning our use of such information. Please read this
                  policy carefully. We may need to change this policy from time
                  to time in order to address new issues and reflect changes on
                  our site. We will post those changes here so that you will
                  always know what information we gather, how we might use that
                  information, and whether we will disclose that information to
                  anyone. Please refer back to this policy regularly.</p>
                  <p><b>Personal Identification Information</b><br>
                  We will never intentionally disclose any personal
                  identification information about you as an individual user
                  (such as, for example, your full name, street address,
                  telephone number, credit card number, or e-mail address) to
                  any third party without having received your permission. We
                  may request personal identification information from you in
                  connection with your use of, or participation in, our surveys,
                  quizzes, games, forums, subscription registrations, content
                  submissions, chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups,
                  requests for suggestions, visitors' requests for products or
                  services, or additional information, and in connection with
                  other activities, services or resources we may make available.
                  In all of these cases, we will collect personal identification
                  information from you only if you voluntarily submit such
                  information to us.</p>
                  <p>If you do provide us with personal information, we may use
                  it to conduct the activities described above. If you identify
                  yourself to us by sending us an e-mail with questions or
                  comments, we may use your personal information to respond to
                  your questions or comments, we may file your comments for
                  future reference, or we may discard the information after we
                  have reviewed it.</p>
                  <p>We may also contact you to confirm your registration and
                  regarding changes to the Safetyissues.com Site's Terms and
                  Conditions and this Privacy Policy.</p>
                  <p>If you give us your permission, we may also use personal
                  identification information for internal or external marketing
                  and promotional purposes. On occasion, for example, we may
                  send you e-mails to introduce a product or service that we
                  think might be of interest to the users of our sites. For us
                  to obtain your permission to send you this information, we
                  will give you an opportunity to "opt-in" at the time
                  our request for your personal information is made. If you do
                  "opt-in," you may choose to "opt-out" at
                  any time, even after you have provided personal information,
                  but following the procedures set forth below at the end of
                  this Privacy Policy. Please note, however, that under certain
                  circumstances, if you initially do not choose to
                  "opt-in," or if you later "opt-out," you
                  may not be eligible for certain benefits for which a name,
                  e-mail address, telephone number, or other personal
                  identification information is needed.</p>
                  <p>We have the following exceptions to these policies: We will
                  release specific information about you or your account to
                  comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant,
                  subpoena, statute, or court order. We will also release
                  specific information in special cases, such as if there is an
                  attempted breach of the security of the Safetyissues.com site,
                  or a physical threat to you or others.</p>
                  <p>Please note that if you give out personal information
                  online—for example, through a message board or chat
                  room—that information can be collected and used by third
                  parties. Although we strive to protect our users' privacy, we
                  cannot guarantee the security of information you may choose to
                  post on our site.</p>
                  <p><b>Privacy of Children</b><br>
                  We understand that young people need special safeguards and
                  privacy protection. We realize that they may not understand
                  all the provisions of our policy or be able to make thoughtful
                  decisions about the choices that are made available to our
                  adult users. We urge all parents to participate in their
                  children's exploration of the Internet and any online
                  services, and to teach their children about protecting their
                  personal information online.</p>

                    </li><li>If a user under 13 wins a contest for which such user is
                      eligible, notification and prizes will be sent to their
                      parent or guardian who initially registered the user.
                    </li><li>No personal information concerning users under 13 will
                      be used for any marketing or promotional purposes, either

                  <p><b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
                  We do not use "cookie" technology to collect
