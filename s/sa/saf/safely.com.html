<h3 id="pp-intro">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>The terms of this Privacy Policy cover information and data collected by WaveMarket, Inc., dba âLocation Labs,â when you access any Location Labs webpages, including but not limited to <a href="http://www.wavemarket.com">www.wavemarket.com</a>, <a href="http://www.locationlabs.com">www.locationlabs.com</a>, <a href="http://www.safely.com">www.safely.com</a> and <a href="http://www.veriplace.com">www.veriplace.com</a> (âSitesâ) or any services for which Location Labs is the primary provider or is otherwise designated as a service provider in the applicable terms of use (collectively with Sites, the âServicesâ). We will refer to WaveMarket as âLocation Labs,â âWeâ or âUs.â</p>
<p class="privacy-policy">As discussed below, Location Labs often partners with wireless carriers or other third parties in providing location-based services and their privacy policies will apply to you if you subscribe or use their services.</p>
<p class="privacy-policy">Location Labs is committed to offering Services that empower users to decide how they wish to share personal information and location-based data for mobile devices associated with their account. This Privacy Policy describes:</p>
<ul class="privacy-policy">
<li>the information we collect, how we do so and the purposes of our collection</li>
<li>how we use and with whom we share such information</li>
<li>how you can access and update such information</li>
<li>the choices you can make about how we collect, use and share your information</li>
<li>how we protect the information we store about you</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy or our collection and use of information, please contact us as described in Section 12 (âHow To Contact Location Labsâ).</p>
<h3 id="pp-personal">2. Personal Information and Location-Data That We Collect And How We Use It</h3>
<p>Location Labs will collect personal information that is necessary for Location Labs to provide the Services or is otherwise voluntarily submitted by you. Personal Information is information you provide to Location Labs that reasonably and personally identifies you or a user associated with your account.</p>
<p class="privacy-policy">Location Labs provides location-based services. Due to the nature of location-based services, Location Labs necessarily collects the location of mobile devices. To the extent location-based data that Location Labs collects does or can be readily combined with other data to personally identify you, Location Labs will treat such data in the same way as other personal information. Location Labs will not process personal information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Location Labs collects and utilizes personal information and location data (a) to provide the Services; (b) to develop and maintain the ability to audit, research and analyze the Services with the goal of maintaining, protecting and improving our services; (c) to maintain and enhance the technical functioning of our network and services; (d) to enhance existing and/or develop new services; and (e) to investigate or take action regarding alleged or actual misuse of the Services, alleged or actual illegal activities, alleged or actual violations of the applicable terms and conditions, or as permitted or required by law.</p>
<p class="privacy-policy">Please note that by becoming a user, you have given us your express and informed consent to transfer the data that you provide to us to the United States and to process it in the United States.</p>
<p class="privacy-policy">Below are specific examples of information we collect and the additional ways in which we use such:</p>
<ul class="privacy-policy">
<li><strong>Location-Based Services.</strong> Location Labs provides location-based services, so we necessarily collect and use usersâ telephone numbers, location of mobile devices and location-based information to provide the requested Service. For example:</li>
<ul class="privacy-policy">
<li>Certain Services allow you to create personal landmarks (i.e. location-based information). Such landmarks will not be visible to other users or the public generally but they will be used by Location Labs to provide the Services.</li>
<li>Certain Services access your wireless account to verify your identity or your relationship/ownership of other devices on your account and Location Labs uses such information to provide the Services.</li>
<li>Certain Services allow you to disclose the geographic location of mobile devices associated with your account so that they are visible to other users that you specify. Location Labs utilizes such location-data to provide the given Service and will disclose it consistent with the preferences configured in your account.</li>
<li>Certain Services allow you to share the geographic location of your mobile device with other applications. Consistent with the terms of service for each such Service, you can control which applications â if any â receive such location-data, and thus, how it is disclosed with respect to such applications. Location Labs utilizes such data to provide the given Service and will disclose it consistent with the preferences configured in your account.</li>
<li>Certain mobile devices may automatically relay location data to Location Labs and we use such information to provide the Services.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Account Data.</strong> To use the Services (but not all Sites), you must create an account or otherwise register with Location Labs and, depending on the Service, you will be required to provide one or more of the following: your telephone number, name, email address, ZIP/postal code and/or a password. For certain Services you may voluntarily provide other information, including other personal information. And for a limited number of Services that require you to pay a fee to Location Labs, we will process your credit card information. All of this information is collectively referred to as Account Data. Some of this information standing alone is not personal information but when it is combined with other information, it may be deemed personal information. In that situation, we will treat the information as such.</li>
<ul class="privacy-policy">
<li>Account Data is necessary for establishing your account and requested services and we use it to provide the Services to you. We may use your Account Data to send you (a) Welcome notices; (b) service-related or security-related notices and announcements; (c) notices required or permitted to be provided under our agreement with you (âLegal Noticesâ); and/or (d) promotional notices.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Public Communications.</strong> If you choose to participate in âpublicâ postings or sessions or any other type of similar exchanges that are available as part of a given Service, you may voluntarily disclose personal information to others or the public generally, and you solely are responsible for such disclosures. When users disclose information to the public, others may collect and use such information. Location Labs has no control over third parties accessing and utilizing information you post or otherwise make available to others that you specify or the public generally.</li>
<li><strong>Communications With Location Labs.</strong> When you contact Location Labs via e-mail, SMS or otherwise, such communication may include personal information and non-personal information. Location Labs uses and retains this information for the purposes stated above and to process your inquiries.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pp-nonPersonal">3. Non-Personal Information Collected Through Technology</h3>
<p>In providing our Services, we also collect other information that does not personally identify you (non-personal information) as an individual (such as, patterns of utilization) and this data is exclusively owned by Location Labs. We reserve the right to disclose non-personal information to third parties. We have listed below specific examples of non-personal information we collect and how we use it.</p>
<ul class="privacy-policy">
<li><strong>Cookies.</strong>A cookie is a tiny data file, which resides on your computer, which allows Location Labs to recognize you when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. One type of cookie, known as a âpersistentâ cookie, is set once you have logged in to your Location Labs account. The next time you visit the Site(s), the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user. To access or change any of your private information (such as contact information), however, you must enter your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log out of the Services Site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you wish to access it.
<p class="privacy-policy">We also use âsessionâ cookies to identify a particular visit to a Location Labs website. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Sites/Services.</p>
<p class="privacy-policy">Like the information you enter at registration, cookies allow for the customization of the user experience with respect to the Sites and Services. However, a cookie does not necessarily include any personal information, and we do not store personal information in cookies unless you expressly direct us to do so.</p>
<p class="privacy-policy">You may modify your Web browser to prevent or notify you whenever a cookie is sent to your computer. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you reject a cookie, you may still access the Sites or Services, but such access may be limited and you may not be able to use all the functionality associated with them.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Log Files.</strong>Consistent with communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Sites, our servers automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, which may include the URLs of the site you were viewing before clicking on the Location Labs-associated URL, your IP address, cookies, the type of web browser and operating system you are using, the webpages you request and click-stream data and other types of data.
<p class="privacy-policy">We use this information to analyze overall trends, to administer our webpages, to track usersâ use of the webpages, to gather information about those we provide services to and to otherwise help us improve Location Labsâ services. Standing alone, this information is not personal information. To the extent it is combined with other data and becomes personal information, it will be treated as such.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or Web Bugs) are pieces of data embedded in images included on Location Labs web pages. Location Labs uses web beacons to improve how it delivers the Services to you and other users.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pp-underAge">4. We Do Not Collect Personal Information From Persons Under the Age of 18 Without Proper Consent</h3>
<p>Location Labs does not direct its Sites or Services to or knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of 18 (and if a resident of Alabama or Nebraska, not under the age of 19 and if a resident of Mississippi, not under the age of 21); provided however, Location Labs does provide its services with respect to persons under such ages for whom parental consent or other proper consent is provided to Location Labs. Any potential or current user who is under age and for whom parental/other proper consent has not been provided, must immediately cease using the Sites/services and notice should be sent to Location Labs: <a href="mailto:Privacy_support@locationlabs com">Privacy_support@locationlabs com</a>. Or contact us at: Location Labs, Inc., Attn: Privacy Policy, 5980 Horton St., Suite 675, Emeryville, CA 94608.</p>
<h3 id="sharing">5. With Whom Location Labs Shares Location-based Data And Personal Information That It Collects</h3>
<ul class="privacy-policy">
<ul class="privacy-policy">
<li><strong>When We Have Consent.</strong>When you use the Services, you may authorize us to disclose the location of mobile devices associated with your account or personal information included in your account to other users or in conjunction with third party applications that you voluntarily choose to utilize.
<p class="privacy-policy"><strong>If you do not provide consent or you withdraw your consent, then you will not be allowed to access or you will be required to stop using the Service as your consent is necessary for us to provide the Service.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Service Providers And Wireless Carriers.</strong> Location Labs will share location-data and personal information with third parties with which we have a relationship in order to provide the Location Labs Services as follows:</li>
<ul class="privacy-policy">
<li>Location Labs may share with its business partners (âLL Service Providersâ) any personal or non-personal information about you, including but not limited to your name, e-mail address, location data, usage patterns, uploaded images, text, information and any other content so that Location Labs may provide the Services.</li>
<li>LL Service Providers process information per our instructions. We require them to comply with our Privacy Policy and to maintain appropriate confidentiality and security measures. LL Service Providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than provision of the Services.</li>
<li>Location Labs must exchange information with applicable Wireless Carriers (including mobile virtual network operators) to deliver the Services you request and in doing so, Location Labs must comply with your Wireless Carrierâs Privacy Policy. As such, Location Labs requests and strongly recommends that you review the privacy policy of your Wireless Carrier.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p class="privacy-policy"><strong>You may not opt-out of Location Labs sharing location-data and personal information as described in this section because this type of sharing necessary for us to provide the Service.</strong></p>
<ul class="privacy-policy">
<li><strong>Business Transitions.</strong> In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal information will most likely be among the assets transferred. Provided that we have an email address for you, we may notify you via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. As such, it is important that you maintain a current email address as part of your account.</li>
<li><strong>Business Transactions.</strong> Location Labs may disclose to third parties restricted location-based data that is based on actual location-based data Location Labs collects. Restricted location-based data does not identify you and to the best of Location Labsâ knowledge cannot be easily combined with other data such that third parties may personally identify you. <strong>Because this type of information does not include personally identifiable information, you may not opt-out.</strong></li>
<li><strong>As Required By Applicable Law Or As Necessary to Defend Legal Claims Against Location Labs. </strong> There are times when we disclose personal information if legally required to do so. For example, we may provide personal information or location-data to respond to subpoenas, court orders, governmental requests or legal process. We may also disclose personal information and/or location-data if legally necessary to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; and upon doing so would take steps to prevent the public disclosure of any usersâ personal information. <strong>Due to the nature of this type of type of disclosure, you may not opt-out.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pp-account">6. Your Account, How to Opt-Out and How to Access and Modify Your Account Information</h3>
<p>Location Labs requests that you submit and maintain accurate and up-to-date information in any Location Labs account you establish.</p>
