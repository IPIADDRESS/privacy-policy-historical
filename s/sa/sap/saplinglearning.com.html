<h1>Privacy</h1>

<p><strong>What information is collected by Sapling Learning, and how is that information used?</strong></p>

<p>We at Sapling Learning know that safeguarding the privacy of our customers and users is very important. Please take a moment to read this Policy. This Policy describes what information may be collected from you when you subscribe to, and/or use our products and services via this website and how we use that information. By logging on to a Sapling Learning site, you are accepting the practices described in this Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Information we collect automatically:</strong></p>

<p>Whenever you use our websites, we receive and store certain types of information. For example, we use cookies to monitor session information and activity on our sites, and we record the Web browser, computer operating system, and IP address you use to connect to our sites.</p>

<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Sapling Learning's sites use cookies to keep track of your session. Sapling Learning may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password.</p>

<p>Sapling Learning may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of our sites and software. Sapling Learning also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services that are offered to our visitors/customers to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.</p>

<p><strong>Information you provide to us:</strong></p>

<p>We receive and store the information you enter on our websites which may include, but is not limited to, name, address, email address, phone number and other personal information. We use that information to process your subscription, respond to your requests, improve and customize our site, and to communicate with you. When you send email inquiries to Sapling Learning, we use the return email address to answer the email inquiry we receive. If you receive any email correspondence from us that you would rather not receive, simply follow the "unsubscribe" instructions included in the email.</p>

<p><strong>Links</strong></p>

<p>Sapling Learning may create links to other web sites. Sapling Learning will make a reasonable effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual's right to privacy. However, many other sites that are not associated or authorized by Sapling Learning may have links leading to Sapling Learning's sites. Sapling Learning cannot control these links and Sapling Learning is not responsible for any content appearing on these sites.</p>

<p><strong>Does Sapling Learning provide personal information to any third parties?</strong></p>

<p>We will not share your email address or any other personal information collected via our website with any third party, except (i) to our contractors, subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations; (ii) as required by law; and (iii) in the event that our business is sold or merged with another company that contractually agrees to honor the terms of this Policy.</p>

Sapling Learning may keep certain records including, but not limited to, personal data of each user provided during the Sapling Learning registration process and user's course information and scores (all information referred to as "User Records"). User Records are carefully stored in a manner designed so that only authorized individuals can access the User Records.</p>

<p><strong>For K-12 Users</strong></p>

<p>To utilize Sapling Learning's online homework and e-books services, elementary school, middle school, and secondary school users will be required to use an assigned username linked to their school. At the user's discretion, students can change their password (which is stored encrypted), can replace the placeholder name with another name, can enter a city and state, and can enter an&nbsp;ID number. (Note that only the password is stored encrypted.) Finally, students can log in to Sapling Learning and do their homework. Sapling Learning may keep certain records including, but not limited to, personal data of each user provided during the Sapling Learning registration process and user's course information and scores (all information referred to as "User Records"). User Records are carefully stored in a manner designed so that only authorized individuals can access the User Records.</p>

<p><strong>For Both K-12 and Higher Ed Users</strong></p>

<p>Sapling Learning employees and contractors subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations;</p>

<p>Employees or officials of educational institutions in which a user is enrolled or wishes to enroll; and</p>

<p>Federal and state government representatives for audit and evaluation of federal and state supported programs.</p>

<p>Operating under the premise that the educational process is a cooperative venture between users and Sapling Learning, Sapling Learning emphasizes the following rights of users:</p>

<p>The right to inspect and review, with certain limited exceptions, their User Records, including the right to receive explanations and interpretations of the records and to obtain copies of the records when such are needed to allow the user to effectively exercise his/her right of inspection and review;</p>

<p>The right to correct User Records when such records are inaccurate or otherwise in violation of FERPA by submitting to Sapling Learning in writing the requested change and the reason for the change;</p>

<p>The right to withhold any or all student directory information by providing written notice to Sapling as provided below;</p>

<p>The right to report violations of FERPA to the Department of Education; and</p>
