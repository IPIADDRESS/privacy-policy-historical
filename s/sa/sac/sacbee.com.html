<h1>Privacy Policy</h1><h3> </h3>




<div id="storyBody" class="storyText">

<p><b>Effective Date: June 10, 2005</b><br>
<br>
</p><p>
Sacbee.com has a firm commitment to privacy. We take your privacy concerns 
  seriously and want to make every effort to address them as we strive to offer 
  our site visitors a high quality, interactive and personalized experience. That 
  is why we have adopted the following policy, which explains our position on 
  information gathering and how we intend to use and share any information we 
  collect. It is important to note that this policy applies only to information 
  collected by sacbee.com and does not apply to information obtained or used by 
  The Sacramento Bee or its affiliates through other means.</p>
<p></p><p>
 Sacbee.com collects and stores Personally Identifiable Information such as 
  your name, address, e-mail address, etc. What information we collect and store 
  depends on the page you are visiting and the services you elect to participate 
  in. We use this information to operate our services, provide you with the highest 
  quality services, offer you opportunities we think will be of interest, and 
  better tailor the advertising you see from us to suit you. This information 
  is not shared with anyone outside of The Sacramento Bee and sacbee.com except 
  as provided for in this Privacy Policy. More specifics on the information we 
  collect are outlined within this policy. </p><p></p>



<p></p><p>
 This privacy policy is subject to change from time to time. If the policy 
  is revised, a notice will be placed in the Member Center where registered members 
  of our service may also update their personal information, subscribe to e-mail 
  newsletters and revise the permissions that they previously granted sacbee.com. 
  They may also receive an e-mail outlining the change. Non-registered users of 
  sacbee.com may view the privacy policy, including any revisions, by clicking 
  on the "Privacy Policy" link on the home page of sacbee.com. If the changes 
  represent a material departure from our current policy or materially affect 
  users' rights and obligations, if feasible, the changes will be posted on this 
  page 30 days in advance of their effective date. </p>
<p></p><p>
 <b>What information we collect and how it is used</b><br>
  Access to special content, services and features on sacbee.com requires users 
  to be subscribers to The Sacramento Bee and to become registered members at 
  sacbee.com. Member registration requires you to provide certain Personally Identifiable 
  Information, such as your name, e-mail address, street address, gender, and 
  date of birth. You will be asked to select a membername and password so that 
  you have access to this information and can revise it in the future. To complete 
  the registration process, we will send you a validation e-mail message. You 
  must click the link in the e-mail to fully activate your membership account. 
  You will also have the opportunity to subscribe to e-mail newsletters and alerts 
  and elect to receive E-mail Offers sent to you on behalf of sacbee.com advertisers.   
  Some features and services may require additional Personally Identifiable Information 
  or other demographic information. We may collect other personal information 
  when you provide feedback, comments, engage in chat, message boards, interactive 
  forums or participate in surveys, or if you contact us offline. For example, 
  when you enter contests you will be asked to also provide your phone number 
  so that we can reach you in the event you've won a prize. All users may decline 
  to share such information with us, by choosing not to register on the web site 
  or use our services. Only registered members, however, may access certain content, 
  services and features. </p>
<p></p><p>
 You may also be asked to create a separate registration account with some 
  of the services provided by partners and other providers on sacbee.com. An example 
  is the sacbeeMail e-mail service. Be aware that the information collected by 
  a provider may be subject to the privacy policy and terms of use of that provider, 
  and we recommend reviewing these prior to submitting your registration. </p>
<p></p><p>
 If you wish to forward an article to a friend, we will ask that you provide 
  your friend's name and e-mail address. While we may collect statistics on which 
  articles are forwarded, we do not sell, rent, or market your friend's personal 
  information, and retain the information only as long as necessary to provide 
  this service. </p><p></p><p></p><p>
 <b>Passive data collection and use</b><br>
  Like most Web sites, sacbee.com also collects and logs information automatically 
  and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to you, such 
  as your IP address, the name and location of your Internet Service Provider, 
  the type and version of your browser, the length of time that you stay on sacbee.com, 
  search queries, your click-stream data, the location that referred you to sacbee.com 
  and the average number of pages viewed. If you visit another website prior to 
  browsing sacbee.com, that website might place personally identifiable information 
  within a URL, which may be logged by us. Your IP address is the identifier assigned 
  to your particular computer when you access the Internet. Depending on how you 
  connect to the Internet, your IP address may always be the same, or it may change 
  each time you access the Internet. Note that logging your IP address does not 
  in and of itself provide us with your name, e-mail address or home or work address. 
  We use this log information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes 
  and may also use it to gather general demographic information about you such 
  as your general location and your Internet Service Provider. In order to better 
  provide our services to you and to develop member profiles that enable us to 
  focus our site, services and advertisements on your interests, we may correlate 
  this log information with other information about you, such as your registration 
  information or newspaper subscription records. </p>
<p></p><p>
 <b>Use of cookies</b><br>
  Most standard Web browsers contain a feature called "cookies," which allow a 
  Web site to place information about a user's visit to that Web site in a small 
  data text file that is stored on the user's computer. Our use of cookie technology 
  will likely be transparent to you and is used to recognize you and hold information 
  from one visit to the next in an effort to increase your ease of use of sacbee.com 
  and to allow us to better understand how people use our site through click-stream 
  analysis. For example, cookies are used to store your member name and password, 
  sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit. Another 
  example is that we may use cookie technology to control the number of times 
  you see a particular advertisement while visiting sacbee.com You can turn the 
  cookies feature off by using your browser preference options, but doing so will 
  severely limit your access to sacbee.com and may prevent you from registration. 
</p>
<p></p><p>
 Some of sacbee.com's third party content providers also may place a cookie 
  on the user's computer. If a user chooses to monitor or restrict cookies that 
  are placed on his computer, the user can determine the Web site that is attempting 
  to place a cookie. Those cookies are controlled by the content provider, and 
  users should refer to that provider's privacy policy for further information 
  regarding its use of cookies. </p><p></p><p></p><p>
 We use software developed by another company, RealMedia, to display advertising 
  on sacbee.com, and we may use cookies in conjunction with displaying those ads. 
  In addition, advertisers may elect to use other advertising companies to serve 
  their ads on sacbee.com, and advertisers themselves may also place a cookie 
  on a user's computer. We do not have access to the cookies or their contents 
  that are placed by advertisers or by third-party advertising companies. </p><p></p><p>
</p><p>
We participate in Tacoda Audience Networks (TAN), through which Tacoda Systems places a cookie on the user's computer to gather non-personal information about the user, such as the user's browsing behavior and demographic information.  This non-personal information is aggregated into audience segments, allowing Tacoda to display relevant advertising to users visiting our site and users of our site who visit the websites of other members of TAN.  Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with Tacoda or with third-party members of TAN.  For more information about how Tacoda uses the information collected by these cookies, please review <a href="http://tacoda.com/privacy_policy.htm" target="_new">Tacoda's privacy policy</a>. We are not responsible for any actions or policies of Tacoda or of any third party members of TAN.  Users may elect to be excluded from this and other targeted-advertising networks <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_new">by following this link</a>. <!--?p--></p><p>
</p><p>
 <b>Use of personally identifiable information</b><br>
  Personally Identifiable Information may be accessed by the user who entered 
  it, by The Sacramento Bee and sacbee.com personnel, and by certain third parties, 
  such as those who provide technical support or content services to sacbee.com. 
  We ask these third parties to keep any personal information supplied by us confidential. 
  We also endeavor to keep your Personally Identifiable Information inaccessible 
  to other users or advertisers of sacbee.com. Note that your first name may be 
  displayed on sacbee.com when you visit sacbee.com as a logged in member. We 
  will also display your e-mail address and contact information in your Member 
  Center. We make every effort to make the Member Center secure, such that; it 
  can only be accessed by logging in with your membername and password. </p><p></p><p></p><p>
 We also reserve the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information 
  when deemed necessary or appropriate to comply with the law, respond to claims, 
  protect our computer systems and customers, ensure the integrity and operation 
  of our business and systems, or protect the rights, property or safety of sacbee.com, 
  its affiliates, or others. </p>
<p></p><p>
 We will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information without your 
  advance permission except as explained in this privacy policy or as explained 
  at the time the information was collected. </p>
<p></p><p>
 <b>Use of aggregated information</b><br>
  In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, 
  we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to create a compiled, aggregate 
  view of the sacbee.com audience and their usage patterns. We use Aggregated 
  Information to operate our services and to better understand our audience as 
  we develop new content and services. Aggregated Information may also be shared 
  with third parties we contract with to provide content and services on sacbee.com 
  as well as advertisers so that they can better understand our audience. For 
  example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are female 
  or within a certain age range or live within a cluster of ZIP codes. </p>
<p></p><p>
 <b>Children's privacy</b><br></p><p>  Sacbee.com is particularly concerned with providing a safe online environment 
  for children. Children under the age 13 will not be allowed to register and 
  become a member of sacbee.com in order to access general sacbee.com content, 
  features and services. </p>
<p></p><p>
 In the near future, parents and legal guardians of children under age 13 who 
  register are able to establish a member account for their child by accessing 
  the Member Center. Other areas and services operated by sacbee.com that do not 
  require registration but that ask for Personally Identifiable Information from 
  children under age 13 will require a parental consent before collecting the 
  information. The Sacramento Bee does not ask children under age 13 for more 
  personal information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary 
  to participate in a given activity or promotion. Further, we limit most of our 
  contests to people who are at least 18 years of age, making children ineligible 
  to enter. </p>
<p></p><p>
 Parental consent to collect information about children can be provided in 
  two ways: (1) Fax a copy of a completed <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/live/guide/online/consent.html">Parental 
  Consent Form</a>, including your signature, to the facsimile number provided 
  on the Parental Consent Form. This form will be available in applicable areas 
  of our site. (2) Mail a completed Parental Consent Form to the address indicated. 
</p>
<p></p><p>
 Sacbee.com will not knowingly disclose personal information about users under 
  the age of 13 without prior parental or legal guardian consent, except as required 
  by law. If for any reason you wish to access, update or remove information about 
  your child that has been previously provided to sacbee.com, you may fax us (at 
  916-552-5200), call us (at 916-321-1240) or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:webmaster@sacbee.com">webmaster@sacbee.com</a>. </p><p></p>
<p></p><p>
 Sacbee.com strongly recommends parental supervision when a child uses the 
  Internet, particularly when a child enters a forum or uses e-mail. We also encourage 
  parents to instruct their children not to give out personal information in these 
  areas.</p>
<p></p><p>
 <b>Member mail and e-mail offers</b><br>
  Sacbee.com does not rent, sell, barter or give away its user or member lists 
  or its users' or members' names, e-mail addresses or mailing addresses for use 
  by advertisers and other third parties for the purpose of solicitations, unless 
  the user has previously given his or her consent at the time of general registration 
  or registration for a specific contest or service. If a user granted permission 
  to receive solicitations (referred to as E-mail Offers) at the time of registration 
  but subsequently wishes to opt out from receiving such solicitations, the user 
  may go to the Member Center and change one or more of the category-specific 
  permission related to receiving e-mail from The Sacramento Bee and sacbee.com 
  advertisers. </p>
<p></p><p>
 All registered users will receive periodic Member Mail via e-mail related 
  to their membership account or various features and services on Bee Web sites that 
  their membership entitles them to access. Because Member Mail is an important 
  part of our service to you, users cannot opt-out of receiving Member Mail. </p>
<p></p><p></p><p> Separate from sacbee.com Member Mail, The Sacramento Bee may send you information 
  via e-mail about various products or services that we believe may be of interest 
  to you, including e-mails that may contain content provided by third party advertisers. 
  If you don't want to receive this information, you can opt out by changing your 
  permission setting for The Sacramento Bee Promotions e-mail in the Member Center. 
  The Member Center also allows you to select which categories of E-mail Offers 
  might interest you. </p>
<p></p><p>
 When a user specifically authorizes e-mail solicitations we make available 
  the user names and other Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with 
  the applicable license. </p>
<p></p><p>
 Our HTML-encoded e-mail messages may include graphic files, which we use to 
  gather information about e-mails sent our members. When such a message is opened 
  in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer accesses our server 
  to retrieve the graphic file, and allows us to record and store the date and 
  time, the recipient's e-mail address, and other standard logging information. 
  These HTML-encoded e-mail messages may also read cookies. </p>
<p></p><p>
 <b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b><br>
  Sacbee.com expects its partners, providers of content and services and advertisers 
  to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, 
  including our partners, providers of content and services, advertisers and others 
  accessible through our site may have their own privacy and data collection policies 
  and practices. For example, during your visit to sacbee.com you may link to, 
  or view as part of a frame on a sacbee.com page, certain content that is actually 
  created or hosted by a third party. Also through sacbee.com you may be introduced 
  to, or be able to access information, services, Web sites, features, contest 
  or sweepstakes offered by other parties. The Sacramento Bee and sacbee.com are 
  not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should 
  check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing 
  information on a feature or page operated by a third party. </p><p></p><p></p><p>
 <b>Electronic commerce with The Sacramento Bee</b><br>
  For certain electronic commerce services on sacbee.com, such as placing classified 
  ads electronically or subscribing to The Sacramento Bee newspaper, we require 
  additional information. To complete these transactions, we may collect information 
  from you such as your name, credit card number and other financial or Personally 
  Identifiable Information. We endeavor to protect the security of your payment 
  information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, 
  which encrypts information you submit. The Sacramento Bee uses the credit card 
  and shipping information for the purpose of completing the transaction and does 
  not provide this information to third parties except for the issuers of credit 
  cards in order to process the transaction, or as otherwise set forth in this 
  policy. </p>
<p></p><p>
 <b>Changing your personal information</b><br>
  In general, a registered member may return to his or her account information 
  page in the Member Center to update the information he or she previously provided 
  to us. To prevent minors from improperly entering contests for which they are 
  not eligible, we may require additional proof from people asking to change their 
  birth date information. Information you provide to sacbee.com may be stored 
  by us for an indefinite time. This information includes the registration data 
  as well as information provided in conjunction with various membership services, 
  contests or features available on sacbee.com </p>
<p></p><p>
 You can delete your sacbee.com membership account in Member Center by clicking 
  on the link labeled "delete my account." By doing so, all but a transactional 
  record of your membership account will be removed from our databases, though

  Sacbee.com supports P3P, the Platform for Privacy Preferences, which allows 
  us to convey our privacy policies, to the extent possible, in standardized, 
  machine-readable code. While our site supports P3P, the resulting code has inherent 
  limitations such that it does not fully and may not accurately express all of 
  our data practices. Some P3P-enabled browsers may interpret the same P3P code 
  in different ways, while others may interpret P3P code in a manner inconsistent 
  with the original intention. Accordingly, your browser's interpretation of the 
  P3P code should only be considered as a short-hand expression of our privacy 
  practices. This Privacy Policy remains our primary policy, and takes precedence 
  over the P3P code for all purposes.</p>
