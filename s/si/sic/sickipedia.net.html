            <p class="article__text">
                This privacy policy applies to all Sickipedia users worldwide. For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and in Switzerland, Sickipedia complies with the principles of the U.S. - EU Privacy Shield Program and the U.S. - Swiss Privacy Shield Program, and has applied to participate In both programs. Under both programs, we are subject to the Investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission, and we are liable for the unauthorized transfer to third parties of user personal data.

        <div class="article__item">
            <h2 class="article__heading">Information we collect and the purposes for which we use it </h2>
            <p class="article__text">
                <strong>Automatically collected information</strong>
                Our servers automatically collect the following Information regarding devices that access our site or app: device characteristics (including device ID for mobile devices), operating system, browser type, IP address, username from stored cookies if present, dates and times of each login, page and Image viewing statistics, and incoming and outgoing links. We use this automatically collected anonymous data to analyze how our site and app are used so as to keep them optimized, to determine the popularity and usefulness of various features, to maintain the integrity of user accounts so that each user can see his or her posts and the upvotes, downvotes, and comments to them, and to enable users with usernames to access their posts, albums, and membership information. We also use such data to enable us to comply with copyright law, with 18 USC §2258A (illegal content), and to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including national security, courts, and law enforcement.
                None of this information is "personal data" — that is, data we could use to Identify a specific person. Some of this information could, however, become personal data because we provide automatically collected anonymous data to third party advertisers to supplement the tracking information described below, and those third parties might be able to combine our anonymous data with other data they have to enable them to identify people.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="article__item">
            <h2 class="article__heading">Interactively collected information </h2>
            <p class="article__text">
                In addition to the automatically collected anonymous data described above, we may place information on your device and then retrieve it later: we may use cookies, web beacons, or other anonymous tracking Information to improve our server's Interaction with your device. We also partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) place and/or recognize cookies on your device that collect data about which pages and ads are viewed while our app or site is being used. Advertiser cookies enable customized ads that are selected for display on your device based on the anonymous Information collected. No personal data is on, connected to, or derivable from, these cookies. If you block or disable cookies and other tracking technologies, instead of getting customized ads you will see non-customized (generic) ads. Although our servers currently don't respond to "do not track" requests, you can block tracking in other ways. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies for interest-based advertising, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or see the section below, "Accessing, correcting, and limiting use of your data".
                Sickipedia has not participated in any digital advertising alliance’s (DM) self-regulatory program for Online Behavioural Advertising.

            <h2 class="article__heading">Information you choose to give us </h2>
            <p class="article__text">
                If you sign up with a username, we handle It in the same way as an automatically collected username except that if you don't allow cookies, you have to enter your username each time you log in. A usemame is, by nature, publicly posted information. On occasion we may run a contest or other type of promotion, and to enable us to award prizes to the winners as well as to comply with the applicable laws, we collect real names and contact information — so if you win a contest, we'll ask for that Information and we'll use It only for those two specific purposes.
                We collect whatever personal data about you that you choose to give us, such as a contact email address (which we do not make public and do not pass along to ad partners) and profile information. We do not require you to use an account to read content on the website, and if you open an account you do not have to provide any personal Information. If you are located in the EEA and wish to open an account, do not use your real name — choose a username that reveals nothing about your identity. If you are located in the LEA It is a violation of this privacy policy to reveal your identity in your usemame. if you give us an email address, we'll probably send you promotional messages once in a while; we'll try to make them fun and interesting but of course you'll be able to opt out at any time.

        <div class="article__item">
            <h2 class="article__heading">Information you post </h2>
            <p class="article__text">
                Sickipedia does not "collect" the stuff you post: images, comments, messages, etc., and — with respect to persons in the EEA — does not "process" or determine any purposes for processing of any information that you manifestly make public. in particular, every joke/Image uploaded to Sickipedia is public — whether uploaded directly without going through a user account, or uploaded via a user account — and has its own URL. No matter what your privacy settings are, every Image can always be accessed and viewed by anyone who types in that exact URL. No post/joke/image uploaded to Sickipedia, is ever completely hidden from public view. For messaging: Sickipedia allows users to send messages to one another both indirectly (via comments to posts) and directly (via chat). Sickipedia’s messaging functionality is not intended to be a secure messaging platform; it's Just for fun. To ensure that Sickipedia’s messaging platform is not used as a platform for Illegality, all messages are public. No messages are ever completely hidden from public view. We may monitor user messaging.

                Because we don't collect information about the identity of our users and don't receive any Information from third parties enabling us to identify our users, we have no means of knowing, or providing you with Information about, whatever anonymous data about you we might have on our servers — unless you have a username. If you have a username, you may log In and access your data, correct whatever Information you deem to be incorrect, opt out of information sharing with our advertisers, or delete your account. For legal reasons we may retain backup and/or archival copies of information prior to your corrections, amendments, or deletions.
