    <p>This information is completely anonymous. This information helps us determine if your computer has the minimum requirements necessary to download the Software and is used to help us improve the Service. 
    </p><p>SideStep uses cookies in several ways. We use cookies to track your usage of the Service to assist us in serving advertisements through our advertising networks. "Cookies" are small text files that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. 
    </p><p><i>Transaction Information</i> <br>
      SideStep collects transaction information such as services purchased, sites used and offers accepted by our users. In the event that you make a purchase with a travel provider through the Service, we collect the information that you provide to the travel supply including itinerary information such as name, dates of travel, travel origination and destination, and payment information. As a general rule, we do not collect credit card numbers. The only exception is if you purchase travel services from a travel provider for which we host the booking process. In the limited cases where we host the booking process, we electronically package the booking information that you provide to us (including your credit card number in encrypted form) and transmit the information to the travel provider. Other than this one transmission, Sidestep does not use your credit card number and does not retain or share your card number with anyone other than the travel provider from whom you are making your purchase.

      <span class="headerSub">How will the information SideStep collects be used?</span><br>
      We gather this information in order to facilitate transactions on your behalf, to personalize and improve our service offerings to you and to ensure that we are compensated by our partners. In order to facilitate your purchase, we have to disclose your information to the travel providers that you have selected. We also use this information in the aggregate to better understand what purchases users want to make and help provide better offers and a more effective service. We may offer personalized services for those people who choose to use them. We may also develop aggregate - but not individual - reports for our partners. An example of a summary report might be "500 users booked travel to a specific city during the month of November." As mentioned above, if you provide us with your email address, we may use it to send you information we think is useful, including information about special offers, new products and services. It is our policy to not send email messages to users who do not wish to receive them. You always have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such emails in the manner described in paragraph 1 above and paragraph 4 below.
    </p><p><a name="3"></a><span class="headerSub">With whom does SideStep share the information it collects about you?</span><br>
    Your personal information is never sold, rented or given to a third party other than the travel providers with which you decide to book your travel. Trend and aggregate data about users' habits and use of the Service is tracked by SideStep to enable SideStep to provide its users with an increasingly improved Service. Beyond these disclosures, we do not share your personal information with any third party without your consent, except (i) when we believe it is required by law or judicial authority; (ii) to safeguard SideStep's rights or property; or (iii) if SideStep should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if SideStep should decide to buy, sell or reorganize some part or all of its business, SideStep may be required to disclose your personal information to prospective or actual purchasers or receive personal information from sellers. It is SideStep's practice to seek appropriate protection for information disclosed or received in these types of transactions.    </p>
    <p><a name="4"></a><span class="headerSub">What are the opt-out choices SideStep provides you regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your information?</span><br>

    </p><p>Regardless of email contact opt-in status, SideStep reserves the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email and infrequent alert messages to our users to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to use the Service. 
    </p><p><a name="5"></a><span class="headerSub">What security procedures does SideStep use to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information collected by the company?</span><br>
    SideStep operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our internal security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users.    </p>
    <p>While SideStep takes reasonable steps to secure your personal information, no system is fault proof. If SideStep's security systems are breached SideStep may attempt to notify you electronically and, by using the Service and/or providing personal information to us, you agree that we can notify you electronically. SideStep may post a notice on the SideStep Web Site if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the SideStep Web Site. SideStep may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at privacy@Sidestep.com. If your email address changes and you have provided SideStep with personal information, you should notify SideStep at <a href="mailto:privacy@Sidestep.com">privacy@Sidestep.com</a> so that we can communicate with you if necessary. 
    </p><p>Children under 13 should not send any information about themselves to SideStep. If a child under 13 submits information through any part of the Service, and we learn the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible. Because we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13, we do not use or disclose such information to third parties.
