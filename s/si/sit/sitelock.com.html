         <h2>PRIVACY POLICY </h2>

         <p>Your privacy is very important to SiteLock, LLC (Henceforward the “Company”, “We”, Us”). We want 
to make your experience using our services on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, 
and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete 
confidence.</p> 
 
         <p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This 
privacy policy applies to http://www.sitelock.com owned and operated by SiteLock, LLC. This Privacy 
Policy describes how the Company collects information from all end users of the Company’s services 
(the “Services”) — those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts (“Visitors”) as 
well as those who pay a service fee to subscribe to the Service (“Customers”) — what we do with the 
information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Customers have concerning the collection and 
use of such information. The Company requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p> 
 
         <p>SiteLock, LLC has been awarded TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and 
practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy-program-requirements/" target="_blank">TRUSTe's program requirements</a> 
including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal 
information. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, 
http://www.sitelock.com. The TRUSTe program does not cover information collected through the 
network of Web sites accessible through our Services.</p> 
 
         <p>TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and 
organizations globally through its leading privacy Trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have 
questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at 
<a href="mailto:support@sitelock.com">support@sitelock.com</a>. If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint">TRUSTe here</a>.</p> 
 
         <p>SiteLock, LLC complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe 
Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, 
and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. SiteLock, 
LLC has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward 
transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor 
program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a></p>
 
         <p>1. <b>Introduction.</b> The Company collects information in different ways from Visitors and Customers 
who access the various parts of our Web site, Services and the network of Web sites accessible 
through our Services. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you 
use our Services and, generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may 
disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very 
special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other 
special cases described below.</p>

         <p>2. <b>Registration.</b> Customers are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for 
our Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card 
number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. Visitors inquiring 
about the Services may be asked to submit business information, such as company name and phone 
number. The personal information collected from Customers during the registration process is used to 
manage each Customer's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with 
third parties. The Company may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal 
information Customers provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Customers). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying 
information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.</p>
 
         <p>3. <b>The Company’s Partners and Sponsors.</b> Some of the Company products and services are 
offered to Visitors and Customers in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and 
Customers some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain 
personal information. In these instances, we will provide such data collected or transferred to our 
Partners and Sponsors (e.g., domain registration). Additionally, many of the Company Customers 
have co-branded pages that are co-sponsored by non-affiliated partners. The Company will share 
non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not personal information, 
with such partners in order to administer the co-branded products or services offered. We may 
provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business
activities limited to security, fraud detection and / or compliance services. These companies are
authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. </p>
 
         <p>4. <b>Responses to Email Inquiries.</b> When Visitors or Customers send email inquiries to the Company, 
the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. The Company does not use 
the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any 
third party. </p>

         <p>5. <b>Voluntary Customer Surveys.</b> We may periodically conduct both business and individual 
customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide 
us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we 
provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if 
the survey is conducted by a third party; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personal 
information for any other purpose. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. We will not 
share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless 
we give you prior notice and choice. We take the information we receive from individuals responding 
to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other Company 
customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, 
residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We 
then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new 
services and products. This aggregated, non-personal information may be shared with third parties. </p>
 
         <p>6. <b>Special Cases.</b> It is the Company’s policy not to use or share the personal information about 
Visitors or Customers in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an 
opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, the Company may disclose 
personal information about Visitors or Customers, or information regarding your use of the Services 
or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that 
it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy 
Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is 
necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our 
Acceptable Use Policy or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect the 
Company and our Customers. If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a 
portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any 
change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have 
regarding your personal information. </p>
 
         <p>7. <b>“Cookies” and How the Company Uses Them.</b> A “cookie” is a small data file that can be placed 
on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. The Company may use cookies to collect, store, 
and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we 
provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Customer and have created your own Personal Start Page, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable 
and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer 
information. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet 
browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some 
areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.</p>

         <p>Additionally, be aware that if you visit non-Company Web sites where you are prompted to log in or 
that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies. Advertisers and partners may also use 
their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for 
information collected through them. </p>
 
         <p>8. <b>Statistics.</b> As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in 
log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service 
provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use 
this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to 
track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base 
as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. </p>
 
         <p>9. <b>The Company's Commitment to Data Security.</b> The security of your personal information is 
important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order 
forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both 
during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method 
of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 
Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and 
alteration of the information under our control. If you have any questions about security on our Web 
site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@sitelock.com">support@sitelock.com</a> </p>
 
         <p>10. <b>How to Access, Delete or Modify Your Information.</b> If your personal information changes, or if 
you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or amend it by making the change on your 
account settings page, request deletion by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@sitelock.com">support@sitelock.com </a>
or by contacting us by telephone at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your

         <p>Administrators of company accounts have the ability to add new users by inputting their name and 
email address. If a user of the Services desires to have their information modified or deleted, they 
should contact the administrator they deal with directly.</p>  
 
         <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you 
services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, 
resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p>
 
         <p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the 
newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or

email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@sitelock.com">support@sitelock.com</a></p>

         <p>11. <b>Testimonials.</b> We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to 
other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you 
wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@sitelock.com">support@sitelock.com</a></p> 
 
         <p>Our Web site also offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that 
any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access 
them. You can request the removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, 
by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@sitelock.com">support@sitelock.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your 
personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p> 
 
         <p>12. <b>Links to 3rd Party Sites.</b> Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may 
differ from those of the Company. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your 
information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy 
policy of any Web site you visit.</p> 
 
         <p>Our Web site also includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook button and Widgets, such 
as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect 
your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature 
to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted 
directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the 
company providing it. </p>
 
         <p>13. <b>Revisions to This Policy.</b> We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our 
information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail 
address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming 
effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy
