COPPA Notice We strongly discourage users under the age of 13 from signing up but in that case that they do sign up and use the site then parents should know that the information collected is the username, email address, city, country, photos of the user and an 'about me' section where they can put anything they want or nothing at all. 

We do not sell any users information to anyone. 

Parents can contact the site operator, listed below, to have a child's information and profile deleted from the server. 

The email serves to login and recover login info via a lost password link. 

Occasionally the user may be sent a notice from the site regarding some matter involving the site or for a promotional advertising offer. 

We believe that the information required by the site is reasonably necessary to participate in the sites services and activities and we are not permitted to condition a Childs participation in an activity on the Childs disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. 

The parent of a Child, or the Entity that (acting with parental authorization) provides a Child with access to the site, may (a) consent to the collection and use of the Childs personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties except as necessary to operate the site; (b) review and have deleted the personal information of the Child; and (c) refuse to permit further collection or use of the Childs personal information.
