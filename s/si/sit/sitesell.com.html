                <p>Your privacy is of utmost importance to SiteSell. The following policy describes exactly how SiteSell collects and uses non-identifiable and personally identifiable information and how we protect your privacy.</p>

                <h2>1. How does this Privacy Policy apply?</h2>

                <p>This Privacy policy applies to SiteSell.com, our tools and services. Please read this policy in full to understand how SiteSell collects and uses your personal information. If you in any way disagree with our practices, you must immediately discontinue using our websites and services.</p>

                <h2>2. What information we collect and how</h2>

                <h3>2.1 Non-Identifiable Information</h3>

                <p>Your visit to SiteSell.com is entirely private and anonymous. We use third parties like web analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) and advertising companies (e.g., Google AdWords, Facebook Advertising) to measure conversions, collect demographic and interest information, and advertise our services. As you browse sitesell.com, these third parties may place or recognize cookies in your browser (including through the use of tracking pixels and web beacons) to monitor how you use our website and to display advertising or promotional material based on your browsing activities.</p>

                <p>If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt out by going to <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://optout.aboutads.info</a>. Furthermore, if you do not wish your data to be collected via Google Analytics, you may use their <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">opt-out tool</a>.</p>

                <h3>2.2 Personally Identifiable Information</h3>


                <p>We collect personal or private information in the course of providing our services. This mainly consists of contact information such as your name, postal address, email addresses, and phone number. We may also collect billing information such as the payment method (e.g., Paypal Username) and transaction identifiers. Any non-identifiable information (e.g., IP addresses) which could be linked to individually identifiable information is treated as personal information.</p>

                <h3>2.3 Users-of-users' Information</h3>

                <p>We may collect, process or store data on users-of-users. For example, this data could be collected by a SiteSell member on a contact form on their website. In such cases, SiteSell is considered a "Processor" and not as a "Controller," as defined in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). SiteSell has no direct relationship with the users-of-users whose data is processed by us (the "Processor") on behalf of a member (the "Controller"). Each member is responsible for complying with laws and regulations, and for setting their own privacy policies, even if SiteSell does facilitate this process with tools and support. If you wish to access, correct or delete data collected by a SiteSell member, please contact that person directly.</p>

                <h2>3. How we use personal information</h2>

                <p>We collect non-identifiable and personally identifiable information for:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>providing and improving our services;</li>
                    <li>member support, service and billing notifications;</li>
                    <li>contacting visitors and subscribers with promotional content;</li>
                    <li>simplifying management of events and contests and to contact winners;</li>
                    <li>producing statistical reports using non-identifiable data;</li>
                    <li>security and fraud prevention;</li>
                    <li>complying with any applicable laws and regulations.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We will only use your private personal information:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>to make contact with you (e.g., to help you build a successful online business or provide you with technical support);</li>
                    <li>to comply with any applicable laws and regulations;</li>
                    <li>to conduct reasonable business activities such as monitoring the performance of SiteSell websites, campaigns and services or identifying technical issues.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Our services are not permitted for children under the age of 16. No information from anyone under the age of 16 should be submitted to us or any of our services.</p>

                <h2>4. How we share personal information</h2>

                <p>SiteSell has partnered with various technology and service providers in order to fulfill payment processing, domain name registration, web analytics, email distribution and marketing. Our partners adhere to strict privacy standards and have data processing agreements with us. We may be required to transmit personal information (e.g., email addresses, names, domain names) with these third party services and do so securely and according to applicable laws and regulations.</p>

                <p>All third-party data processors are compliant with GDPR, EU-US Privacy Shield Framework or Canada's PIPEDA.</p>

                <p>Examples of third-party data processors:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>OpenSRS (Tucows Inc): When our members register their domain names with SiteSell, we transmit their information to OpenSRS. OpenSRS handles forwarding the domain registration information to the appropriate domain management authority.</li>
                    <li>PaySafe: PaySafe is our payment provider and are regulated in the United Kingdom.</li>
                    <li>MailChimp: we synchronize our members' names and email addresses with MailChimp in order to fulfill our weekly member newsletter and promotional communications with subscribers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. How we protect and store personal information</h2>

                <p>SiteSell operates and stores all member information in Canada. We operate out of a world class datacenter that is protected by top-of-the-line security hardware and monitoring. Our payment processing infrastructure is entirely Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant. SiteSell complies with Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), which is also considered by the European Commission to provide adequate protection for the personal information of EU Member State residents.</p>

                <h2>6. Privacy Policy Updates</h2>

                <p>From time-to-time, we may update this policy to take into account changes in laws, regulations and technology. We encourage you to visit our Privacy Policy to check if it has been updated. You may determine when it was last modified by viewing the "Last modified" date at the top of this policy.</p>

                        The statistics on solopreneur success are dismal. <em>SBI! increases your chances of success by more than 100x!</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The biggest dilemma of the failing solopreneur is figuring out whether to <strong>give up or not</strong>. No one wants to quit too soon. And no one wants to spend good time after bad. It's a tough problem. Here is the perfect solution...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Use SBI!.</strong> Start from the very beginning of the process. "Pretend" to start over. Follow our "Action Guide" and use the tools <em>to the 5th of 10 steps</em>. <strong>You will be sure of which road to take...</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; ð« Flawless research with objective tools uncovers fundamental errors that are either <strong>not fixable</strong>, or <strong>not worth fixing</strong>. This is almost always due to inadequate upfront preparation and research. Start over, this time using SBI!.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; â You find <strong><em>fixable</em> problems</strong> with your online business. Work your way through the rest of the Action Guide, making changes as needed. Your fortunes will turn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> If your online business is failing, either close this window and keep reading about SBI!, or <a href="https://secure.sitesell.com/build/order.html"><strong>try SBI! now, risk-free</strong></a> (or, if you use WordPress, <a href="https://www.sitesell.com/sbiforwp/" target="_blank"><strong><em>read more about SBI! for WP</em></strong></a>).

                        <em>The Internet changes fasssst.</em> Most changes are not relevant to doing business online, but many bloggers are quick to comment and to recommend changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The noise is intense and it can cost you a lot of misspent time, and not just by trying to read it all. You can lose a ton of time when you follow poor or premature recommendations (especially if they turn out to hurt your business).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Major new developments?</strong> We are as proud of being followers (when watchful waiting is the wise course) as we are to be first-to-market when we are 100% sure that something new is both important and will "stick" (e.g., first to update our site-building software to automatically create sitemap files).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll provide a few more examples when you close this message, but the bottom line is this...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>SBI!'s driving mission is to enable you to succeed.</strong> It starts with the perfect all-in-one process/tools/guidance/help <em>business</em>-building solution. <strong><em>Its effectiveness is multiplied by enabling you to focus 100% of your time on your business, period.</em></strong> In practical terms...
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Process:</strong> You don't have to read the ton of new information on search, social, mobile, etc. We do that. We incorporate both the big changes <em>and</em> the occasional golden nugget, when we know that it will "stick."<p>For example, "<strong>Growth Hacking</strong>" is now integrated into the Action Guide. Use it to reduce risk when starting up <em>and</em> to accelerate your business growth.</p></li>

                        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> You never have to update a plugin. Software updates just "happen" and everything works. New tools are added, once again on an "as needed" basis, <em>at no extra cost, nothing for you to do</em>.</li>

                        <li><strong>Guidance:</strong> Forum answers are reviewed. Bad information is "red-inked" as being advice not to follow. We don't censor opinion, but we do let you know when we believe advice is counter-productive. We'll also provide the correct course of action if someone else does not.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In short, auto-updating delivers <strong>100% business-focused efficiency</strong>. SBI! saves you hundreds of hours per year, time that you put into your business!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em><strong>Doing it right</strong> and <strong>staying focused</strong> are why SBIers succeed way more often than other solopreneurs.</em>
