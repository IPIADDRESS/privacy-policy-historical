			Only those employees with relevant business duties (ex., support staff) may access personal information, and <strong>only</strong> to perform their duties.  They are subject to dismissal for any privacy violation.

			We never provide any information about our subscribers, customers or affiliates to any third party, except of course in the unusual event should we be required to do so by law.

			We do use cookies, but <em>only</em> to track behavior of <strong>groups</strong> of users of the Web site, <strong>not</strong> individual usage, and we do <strong>not</strong> tie the cookie to any personal information that you provide to us.  We do not collect or combine any information that you provide to us with any other demographic information from any other sources. We do not use third party tracking services.
