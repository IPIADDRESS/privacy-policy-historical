<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p>SiteTalk websites use "cookies" to enable you to register as a participant of our SNP Website and to help personalise your participant ship online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.</p>
<p>SiteTalk Websites use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly and to display your personalised content and appropriate advertising on your later visits to these sites.</p>
<p>When you sign in to a site using your username and password, the SiteTalk system stores your unique username, and the time you signed in at, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page on the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. The system also uses cookies to improve the sign in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not otherwise want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.</p>
