            <br>
            <strong>Non-personal identification information</strong><br>
            <br>
            We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about Users means of connection to our Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Web browser cookies</strong><br>
            <br>
            Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance User experience. User's web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. User may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Site may not function properly.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>How we use collected information</strong><br>
            <br>
            SiteValueStats collects and uses Users personal information for the following purposes:<br>
            </span>
            <ul class="style3">
              <li><em>- To improve our Site</em><br>
                We continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you.</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="style3"><strong>How we protect your information</strong><br>
            <br>
            We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Site.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Sharing your personal information</strong><br>
            <br>
            We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Third party websites</strong><br>
            <br>
            Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website's own terms and policies.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Advertising</strong><br>
            <br>
            Ads appearing on our site may be delivered to Users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile non personal identification information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Google Adsense</strong><br>
            <br>
            Some of the ads may be served by Google. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to Users based on their visit to our Site and other sites on the Internet. DART uses "non personally identifiable information" and does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, etc. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a><br>
            <br>
            <strong>Compliance with children's online privacy protection act</strong><br>
            <br>
            Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.<br>
            <br>
