                    SiteVacuum Principles</h3>
                <br>
                We built SiteVacuum to make it easy for you to use.
                We also understand your information and privacy is important and sensitive and that
                why we made sure that:
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>1. You Own your Information</strong><br>
                <br>
                You own your information, and we own what you decide to share with us. If you'd
                like us to destroy this information, we will remove your user profile at any time
                if you request it by e-mailing us <a href="mailto:support@SiteVacuum.com">support@SiteVacuum.com</a>.
                We'll do our best to remove any information that is personally attributable to you
                within 10 days.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>2. We ask for information from you, only when we must and in order to provide
                    you quality service</strong><br>
                <br>
                Types of information you may wish to provide us in order to get the best services
                possible:
                <br>
                <br>
                <dl>
                    <dd>
                        <strong>Registration Information</strong> – When you sign up for a SiteVacuum account,
                        we ask you for personal information, including your name, e-mail address and an
                        account password. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services,
                        in which case SiteVacuum may not be able to provide those services to you.

                    <dd>
                        <strong>Information for fulfilling your requests</strong> - Certain functions are
                        impossible to fulfill without getting some information from you. We ask for information
                        only so we can fulfill your request and to provide you quality service, for example
                        registration. 
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        <strong>SiteVacuum cookies</strong> – When you visit the SiteVacuum website &amp;
                        services, we send a small file to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.
                        This file is called a cookie. We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service
                        by storing your preferences. Your browser is probably set up by default to accept
                        cookies, including SiteVacuum cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse
                        all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent to your computer. You should
                        be aware, however, that some of SiteVacuum 's features may not function properly
                        if you disable cookies on your computer.

                        <strong>Standard browser information</strong> – When you visit the SiteVacuum website
                        and use our features and Services, your browser sends information normally just
                        like it does whenever you visit any website. Our servers may record this information
                        that as your computer's browser (not our plug-in) sends whenever you visit any website.
                        These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
                        address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one

                <strong>3. Information Discloser &amp; Usage</strong><br>
                <br>
                SiteVacuum may use your personal information without your prior consent when we
                have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information
                is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process
                or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including
                investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise
                address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm
                to the rights, property or safety of SiteVacuum, its users or the public as required
                or permitted by law. From time to time, we may supplement Personally Identifiable
                Information collected on our Website with information collected by third parties.
                <br>
                <br>
                We will not collect or use personal information for purposes other than those described
                in this Policy unless we have obtained your prior consent.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>California has passed legislation requiring certain specific disclosures be
                    made available to California residents who use the Internet and provide information
                    that may be used for marketing purposes. That legislation requires any business
                    that discloses a customer's personal information to any third party for direct marketing
                    purposes to provide the customer a method for obtaining the names, addresses and
                    certain other specified details of anyone who might have received that personal
                    information. If you are a California resident you may request this information from
                    SiteVacuum by writing to SiteVacuum, 1738 Pearl Street, Suite 202, Boulder, CO 80302
                    Attn: California Privacy Rights or by sending an e-mail to</strong> <a href="mailto:support@SiteVacuum.com">
                        support@SiteVacuum.com</a>. <strong>SiteVacuum is not obligated to respond to more than
                            one such request from you per calendar year.</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                If you are visiting SiteVacuum from outside of the United States, please be advised
                that your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United
                States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data
                protection and other laws of the United States, may might not be as comprehensive
                as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps
                to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our Services, you consent to
                the transfer of your information to our facilities and those third parties with
                whom we share it as described in this Policy.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>4. Information Security</strong><br>
                <br>
                SiteVacuum takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access
                to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data that you share
                and that we collect we store. These security measures include internal reviews of
                our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as
                well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems
                where we store your personal data.
                <br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, we restrict access to personal information only to SiteVacuum employees,
                contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop
                or improve our Services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations
                and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution,
                if they fail to meet these obligations. Unfortunately, no security system can be
                100% secured; accordingly, SiteVacuum cannot guarantee the security of any information
                provided to us in connection with the information that we collect through our website.
