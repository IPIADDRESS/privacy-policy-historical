    <br>

For example, you might see an advertisement on a partner site for a product that you have recently viewed on a Sitecore Site. This may involve the use of cookies. We also partner with third parties to display advertising within the Sitecore services and we contract with service providers to place advertisements on websites owned by third parties. Sometimes this will be achieved by sharing your Personal Data as described in the Cookie Policy.</li>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Using Account Generated Data</strong>. Sitecore will use account generated data in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating the Sitecore Sites. We may use information that is collected through our customer relationships in the same way we use information collected through our Sites and <a href="#3b">Marketing Activities</a>, as well as for the following purposes:
<ul>

<strong>C.	How we share that data</strong>
<br>
<br>
We may share information that is collected through our customer relationships in the same way we share information collected through our <a href="#3c">Sites</a>, as well as for the following purposes:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sharing with Sitecore partners</strong>. Sitecore regularly engages third party technology and implementation partners for joint sales or product promotions. Such activities will always reference the partners involved. We contract with our partners for these activities and our partners may have access to your Personal Information, and either Sitecore or our partners may use that information to provide you with sales or product promotion information, further subject to such partners’ own privacy policies. </li>
</ul>
<a id="processing"></a><strong style="text-transform: uppercase;">Section 6. Processing Your Personal Data</strong>
<br>
<br>
We will only collect and process your Personal Data in the ways described in this Privacy Policy when we have a reason to do so.
<br>
<br>
Sitecore relies on the following reasons for processing Personal Data:
<ul>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 1.1em;"><strong>Consent </strong>(where you have given consent)
    <br>
    We process certain Personal Data based on the consent you provided when you submitted your information. Where we rely on your consent, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time, such as consenting to receive marketing communications.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 1.1em;"><strong>Contract </strong>(where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, i.e. to deliver the Sitecore product or services you or your organization have purchased).
    <br>
    When information is processed under contract, you are able to terminate the contract at any time and request that information be returned to you and/or deleted.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 1.1em;"><strong>Legitimate interests of Sitecore or any third parties.  </strong>
    <br>
    Legitimate interests include enabling us to conduct internal business services, such as audits, mergers and acquisitions, reporting, and improving our products and services. Personal Data will only be processed on these grounds when doing so does not outweigh your rights.
    <br>
    Where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance with laws</strong> (where we are required to process information to comply with applicable laws)
    <br>
    If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences if you do not provide your information). </li>
</ul>
<a id="howwekeepyourinformationsecure"></a><strong>SECTION 7.  HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</strong>
<br>
<br>
At Sitecore, we understand the importance of information, and the need to keep Personal Data secure.  We have implemented and maintain technical, administrative and physical security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, alteration, accidental loss or destruction.
<br>
<br>
We regularly review our security procedures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of all data both online and offline. These security procedures and measures vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and store and the current state of technology but include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls and information access authorization controls. Sitecore has implemented an incident response plan, with a company protocol we follow in the event of any data breach. We take steps to regularly monitor our systems for vulnerabilities and to ensure that we only share information with those who need to know it.
<br>
<br>
However, no website or internet transmission is completely secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or a data breach will never occur, and we cannot warrant the security of any information that you provide to us. You are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of any password(s) and account registration information uses with Sitecore, and verifying that the information we maintain about you is accurate and current.  We are not responsible for protecting any information that we share with a third party based on an account connection that you have authorized.
<br>
<br>
We require that our third party service providers and partners agree to keep the information we share with them confidential and to use the information only to perform their obligations in the agreements we have in place with them. Sitecore has implemented internal policies to ensure that such parties are required under contract to maintain privacy and security protections which are at least as consistent with our own policies and practices.
<br>
<br>
We maintain a list of our current sub-processors of Personal Data and keep the <a href="/trust">Sitecore Trust Center</a>&nbsp;updated with security and related information.
<br>
<br>

We will retain your Personal Data for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, or unless the information is deleted pursuant to the exercise of your rights. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information provided to us. The deletion of your Personal Data and other use of our Sites may result in the deletion and/or de-identification of Other Information that is retained by us.
