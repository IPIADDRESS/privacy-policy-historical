      <!-- Begin -->
    

<p>Site5 Internet Solutions, Inc. ("Site5") has
created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to
privacy to our customers and users of our consulting services, online services,
websites, and web services ("Services").</p>


<p>This privacy policy governs the manner in which Site5 uses,
maintains and discloses information collected from its customers and users of
our Services.</p>



<h2>1. Privacy</h2>



<p>Site5 is committed to developing long lasting relationships
based on trust. As such, Site5 will do everything in its power to ensure that
your right to privacy is maintained and protected. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Our Services are not directed at children
under 13 years of age.</p>



<h2>2. Information We
Collect</h2>



<p>Site5 may request or collect personal information from
online users in a variety of ways, including through online forms for ordering
products and services, and other instances where users are invited to volunteer
such information.</p>



<p>The information we collect is personal information that
identifies you personally, such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>First &amp; last name</li>

<li>Postal address</li>

<li>Telephone and fax numbers</li>

<li>URL</li>

<li>E-mail address</li>

<li>Credit card information</li>

<li>Other billing information</li>
</ul>


<p>Site5 may also collect information about how users access
our Services using a tracking ID unique to each user through the use of cookies
or other similar means.</p>



<h2>3. What are Cookies?</h2>



<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer
tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and
persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log
out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A persistent cookie is a small text
file stored on your computer’s hard drive for an extended period of time.</p>



<p>Your browser’s help file contains information and
instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by
Site5 to track user preferences while the user is using our Services. They also
help to minimize load times and save on server processing. Persistent cookies
may be used by Site5 to store whether, for example, you want your password
remembered or not, and other information. Cookies used on Site5 websites do not
contain personally identifiable information.</p>



<h2>4. Log Files</h2>



<p>Like most standard websites, we use log files. This
information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type,
internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time
stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track
user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for
aggregate use. However, none of the information stored in our log files,
including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to personally identifiable
information.</p>



<h2>5. How we use this
Information</h2>



<p>Site5 may use the personally identifiable information
collected by Site5 to contact customers regarding products and services offered
by Site5 and, to the extent the User has agreed to it, by its trusted
affiliates, independent contractors and business partners.</p>



<p>We may also use this information for research purposes
regarding the effectiveness of our Services and marketing and sales efforts.
Site5 will not in any way share this information with a third party either for
free or by selling it, unless you specifically authorize such disclosures.</p>


<h2>6. Disclosure of Information</h2>



<p>Site5 may also disclose aggregate, anonymous, data based on
information collected from Users to investors and potential partners. In such
cases, statistical information only will be disclosed and personally identifiable
data will be kept strictly confidential. In case Site5 is sold, the information
collected from users may be transferred to the new owners.</p>



<p>Site5 may from time to time engage third parties, including
its own subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to preserve, analyze or
otherwise store or manipulate data received by Site5 from its customers. In all
such cases, such third party service providers will be required to treat all
such data with the same degree of care as Site5 and they will be prohibited from
disclosing such data to any other person or party, except as otherwise provided
for in this Privacy Policy.</p>



<h2>7. Special Offers and
Updates</h2>



<p>Our customers and users will occasionally receive
information on products, services, special deals, and possibly a newsletter.
Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not
receive these types of communications.</p>



<h2>8. Service
Announcements</h2>



<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly
service related announcement, if, for instance, our service is temporarily
suspended for maintenance. Generally, users may not opt-out of these
communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these
communications are not promotional in nature.</p>



<h2>9. Legal Disclaimer</h2>



<p>Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may
need to disclose personal information when required by law, if we have a
good-faith belief that such action is necessary and required to comply with a
current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Site5.</p>



<p>Site5 websites contain links to other sites. Please be aware
that Site5 is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We
encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that
collects personally identifiable information. The Site5 Privacy Policy as
described herein applies solely to information collected by Site5.</p>



<h2>10. Maintenance of
Information</h2>



<p>The information provided to Site5 is saved indefinitely and
may be stored on one or more databases directly or indirectly maintained by
Site5. Site5 employs industry standard security measures to protect the confidentiality
of the information.</p>



<p>While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to
data will not occur; we make every effort to prevent such occurrences. Any
other particularly sensitive information, such as credit card numbers collected
for commercial transactions, is encrypted prior to transmission by you to
Site5.</p>



<h2>11. Your
Responsibility</h2>



<p>You are responsible for the security of the login
information, such as usernames and passwords, which give you access to your
private information maintained by Site5. Make sure you keep login information
in a safe place and do not share it with others.</p>



<p>Note that key-loggers, viruses, or other surveillance
devices can intercept login information on the computers from which you access
our Services, so you should take precautions regarding such devices, especially
from public computers. In addition, you should always log out from any relevant
Services when you are not actively using them.</p>



<h2>12. Questions</h2>



<p>Any questions concerning this Privacy Policy may be directed
to privacy@site5.com.</p>
