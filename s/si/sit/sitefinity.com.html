Under our agreement with this service provider, it is not permitted to store, retain, or use your Personal Information or your billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.  In certain cases, we may have access to the last four digits of your credit card number, its expiration date, and the billing address (collectively, the “Billing Information”), which we will use solely to assist us in providing you better and more efficient customer service.
