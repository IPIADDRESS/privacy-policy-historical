    <p><strong>SiteJabber Principles</strong></p>
    <p>We believe in trust and transparency at SiteJabber.  The more our members trust us—and each other—by being open and honest, the more successful our community will become.  We hope this is reflected in our privacy policy below. </p>
    <p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></p>
    <p>When you visit SiteJabber, you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly   choose to disclose that is collected by us, and website use information   collected by us as you interact with our the SiteJabber website. When you register with SiteJabber, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, email address, telephone number, address, gender, schools attended and any other personal or preference information. When you enter SiteJabber, we may collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all SiteJabber visitors.  In addition, we   may store information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use session ID cookies to confirm that users   are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. We may use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID and password, to make it easier for you to login when you come back to SiteJabber. You   can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser, if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
    <p>When you use SiteJabber, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, post in forms, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so we can provide you with high-quality service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior   messages you have sent or easily see your friends list. When you update information, we may keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.</p>
    <p>You post all Posted Content (as defined in the SiteJabber Terms of Use) the SiteJabber website at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures for any website are impenetrable or 100% secure. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that Posted Content on the SiteJabber website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures   contained on the SiteJabber website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Posted Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your Posted Content.</p>
    <p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on SiteJabber is a violation of the SiteJabber   Terms of Service and should be reported to <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:privacy@SiteJabber.com" target="_blank">privacy@SiteJabber.com</a>.</p>
    <p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our website, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the site. SiteJabber stores this information to send this email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:info@SiteJabber.com" target="_blank">info@SiteJabber.com</a> to request that we remove this information   from our database. </p>
    <p>SiteJabber may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the SiteJabber service through the operation of the service (e.g., photo tags) in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience.</p>
    <p>By using SiteJabber, you consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
