				<h3 class="black">Collection of Personal Information</h3>
				
				<p>We collect information from users including, for the Site, email address; user

				collect information including email address; user name; password; phone number;
				individual and entity names and addresses for persons obtaining the Services;
				Content regarding the user’s support issues or services needed; and
				payment/credit card information.
				</p>
				<p>Registration data.  An email address, username and password are required for
				users to register on the Site. 
				</p>
				<p>Content and other submissions.  If you choose to submit Content on the Site, we
				will collect that information. We may examine it to provide better service and
				filter out any objectionable Content.  We also collect Content you submit in
				connection with the Services, as well as information otherwise volunteered by
				users of our Site, such as by emailing or mailing us.  
				</p>
				<p>Log file information.  When users visit our Site, our servers automatically
				collect certain information that the browser sends when visiting Web sites in
				general.  This log file information may include the URLs you visited; your IP
				address; date, time, and time spent on pages visited; and information about your
				browser and platform.
				</p>
				
				<p>Cookies.  From time to time, our Site may use the “cookies” feature
				of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on
				your computer about your use of the same. We do not set any personally
				identifiable information in cookies.  Cookies help us learn which portions of
				our Site are useful and which need improvement, among other things. You can
				choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser.
				However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience with the Site
				may be significantly diminished and various features may not operate.  
				</p>
				<h3 class="black">Use of Personal Information</h3>
				<p>Generally.  We use the personally identifiable information and aggregate
				information we collect to maintain your account and market and provide the Site,
				the Services and our other products and services to you, to improve our
				offerings and to create new offerings, as provided below.  Content and
				associated data submitted by users may be redisplayed to the public on public
				and private areas of the Site, except that Content and associated data submitted
				in connection with Services will be used only per the relevant Services
				agreement.  
				</p>
				<p>Registration data.  We do not use your personally identifiable information to
				send commercial or marketing messages to you (such as offers regarding the
				Services) without your consent or opt-in.  We may send you certain service and
				administrative notices, which are not subject to opt out.
				</p>
				<p>Log file information and cookies.  We use cookies and log file information to
				remember your information so that you do not need to re-enter it when using the
				Site or the Services, to provide personalized Content; and to administer and
				monitor usage of the Site and the Services.
				</p>
				<p>Aggregate Information. We may use aggregate, non-personally-identifiable data to
				analyze usage of the Site and the Services and customize the Site’s content and
				layout, and to develop and provide our offerings. These uses improve our
				offerings and better tailor them to meet your needs.
				</p>
				<h3 class="black">Information Sharing</h3>
				<p>As a matter of policy, we do not sell, rent or otherwise share any of your
				personal information with third parties without your explicit consent.
				However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information
				may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide the Site and the
				Services: We may share such information if we in good faith believe that such
				action is necessary to: (a) comply with any law, regulation or order, such as
				subpoena, court order or search warrant; (b) provide the Site and the Services
				using subcontractors under confidentiality agreement; (c) ensure compliance with
				our agreements, terms of use and policies; (d) protect and defend our rights or
				property, including investigations and defense of third-party claims; and/or (e)
				protect the rights, property and personal safety of our users, staff or the
				public.  We reserve the right, in the event all or any relevant portion of our
				stock, business or assets is transferred to, acquired by or merged with any
				third party, to transfer or assign as part of such transaction any or all of the
				information we have collected.
				</p>
				<p>Content and associated data you submit may be displayed in public and private
				areas of the Site, except that Content and associated data submitted in
				connection with Services will be used only per the relevant Services agreement. 
				</p>
				<p>We aggregate (gather up data across multiple user accounts) personal information
				and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to third
				parties for their analytical, development, marketing and promotional purposes.
				However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any
				information that could be used to identify you personally. 
				</p>
				<h3 class="black">Account Corrections</h3>
				<p>You may change your account settings by contacting us.  However, we may retain
				any information to the extent required by law or otherwise in connection with
				the permitted information sharing described above.
				</p>
				
				<h3 class="black">Links</h3>
				<p>The Site and Content on it may contain links to other sites and resources
				controlled by third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or
				content of these other sites or resources, and you should consult the privacy
				statements of such other sites and resources.

				<h3 class="black">Data Security</h3>
				<p>The Site and Services have security measures in place to prevent the loss,
				misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but we make
				no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss, misuse, to you or to
				any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration.
				</p>
				<h3 class="black">Changes</h3>
				<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy, including the use of your information for new,
				unanticipated purposes, at any time by posting a revised version on the Site,
				and/or sending information regarding the amendment to your email address in our
				records. You are responsible for regularly reviewing the Site to obtain timely
				notice of such amendments.  You shall be deemed to have accepted such amendments
				by continuing to use the Site and/or the Services after such amendments have
				been posted or information regarding such amendments has been sent to you.  If
				you do not agree with any of such changes, you may immediately cease all access
				and use of the Site and/or the Services. You agree that such termination will be
				your exclusive remedy in such event.  
				</p>
				<h3 class="black">International Users</h3>
				<p>The Site is hosted and the Services are provided in the United States of
				America. If you are accessing the Site or Services from the European Union,
				Asia, or any other jurisdiction with laws or regulations governing personal data
				collection, use, and disclosure, which differ from United States laws, please be
				advised that through your use of the Site and the Services, you are transferring
