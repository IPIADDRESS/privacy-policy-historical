		SitePen, Inc. (“SitePen”, “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to
		respecting the privacy rights of users of our products, services and websites,
		such as http://sitepen.com (including each subdomain, the “Site”)

		Privacy Policy to give you confidence and describe how we treat personal
		information as you visit and use our Site and Services.

		<p>See our <a href="/site/contact.html">contact page</a> to contact us.</p>

		<h2 class="title is-2">Collection of Personal Information</h2>
		<p>We collect information from users including, for the Site, email address; user
		name; password; links, tags, comments, and any other information, data, text,
		software, music, audio, photographs, graphics, video, messages and other
		materials (“Content”) submitted by the user; log file information
		(such as IP address and browser data); and cookies.  For the Services, we
		collect information including email address; user name; password; phone number;
		individual and entity names and addresses for persons obtaining the Services;
		Content regarding the user’s support issues or services needed; and
		payment/credit card information.
		</p>
		<p>Registration data.  An email address, username and password are required for
		users to register on the Site.
		</p>
		<p>Content and other submissions.  If you choose to submit Content on the Site, we
		will collect that information. We may examine it to provide better service and
		filter out any objectionable Content.  We also collect Content you submit in
		connection with the Services, as well as information otherwise volunteered by
		users of our Site, such as by emailing or mailing us.
		</p>
		<p>Log file information.  When users visit our Site, our servers automatically
		collect certain information that the browser sends when visiting websites in
		general.  This log file information may include the URLs you visited; your IP
		address; date, time, and time spent on pages visited; and information about your
		browser and platform.
		</p>
		<p>Cookies.  From time to time, our Site may use the “cookies” feature
		of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on
		your computer about your use of the same. We do not set any personally
		identifiable information in cookies.  Cookies help us learn which portions of
		our Site are useful and which need improvement, among other things. You can
		choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser.
		However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience with the Site

		<h2 class="title is-2">Use of Personal Information</h2>
		<p>Generally.  We use the personally identifiable information and aggregate
		information we collect to maintain your account and market and provide the Site,
		the Services and our other products and services to you, to improve our
		offerings and to create new offerings, as provided below.  Content and
		associated data submitted by users may be redisplayed to the public on public
		and private areas of the Site, except that Content and associated data submitted
		in connection with Services will be used only per the relevant Services
		agreement.
		</p>
		<p>Registration data.  You may receive marketing communications from time to time.
		Each communication will provide you with ability to opt out of all future marketing correspondence.
		We may send you certain service and administrative notices regarding your purchased services,
		which are not subject to opt out.
		</p>
		<p>Log file information and cookies.  We use cookies and log file information to
		remember your information so that you do not need to re-enter it when using the
		Site or the Services, to provide personalized Content; and to administer and
		monitor usage of the Site and the Services.
		</p>
		<p>Aggregate Information. We may use aggregate, non-personally-identifiable data to
		analyze usage of the Site and the Services and customize the Site’s content and
		layout, and to develop and provide our offerings. These uses improve our
		offerings and better tailor them to meet your needs.
		</p>

		<h2 class="title is-2">Information Sharing</h2>
		<p>As a matter of policy, we do not sell, rent or otherwise share any of your
		personal information with third parties without your explicit consent.
		However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information
		may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide the Site and the
		Services: We may share such information if we in good faith believe that such
		action is necessary to: (a) comply with any law, regulation or order, such as
		subpoena, court order or search warrant; (b) provide the Site and the Services
		using subcontractors under confidentiality agreement; (c) ensure compliance with
		our agreements, terms of use and policies; (d) protect and defend our rights or
		property, including investigations and defense of third-party claims; and/or (e)
		protect the rights, property and personal safety of our users, staff or the
		public.  We reserve the right, in the event all or any relevant portion of our
		stock, business or assets is transferred to, acquired by or merged with any
		third party, to transfer or assign as part of such transaction any or all of the
		information we have collected.
		</p>
		<p>Content and associated data you submit may be displayed in public and private
		areas of the Site, except that Content and associated data submitted in
		connection with Services will be used only per the relevant Services agreement.
		</p>
		<p>We aggregate (gather up data across multiple user accounts) personal information
		and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to third
		parties for their analytical, development, marketing and promotional purposes.
		However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any
		information that could be used to identify you personally.
		</p>

		<h2 class="title is-2">Account Corrections</h2>
		<p>You may change your account settings by contacting us.  However, we may retain
		any information to the extent required by law or otherwise in connection with
		the permitted information sharing described above.

		unanticipated purposes, at any time by posting a revised version on the Site,
		and/or sending information regarding the amendment to your email address in our
		records. You are responsible for regularly reviewing the Site to obtain timely
		notice of such amendments.  You shall be deemed to have accepted such amendments
		by continuing to use the Site and/or the Services after such amendments have
		been posted or information regarding such amendments has been sent to you.  If
		you do not agree with any of such changes, you may immediately cease all access
		and use of the Site and/or the Services. You agree that such termination will be
		your exclusive remedy in such event.
