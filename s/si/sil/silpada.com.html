						Thank you for visiting our website. Silpada Designs respects the
						privacy of every individual who visits our websites and online
						areas. We are committed to protecting the privacy of the visitors

							Collection of Information
						</dt>
						<dd>
							We collect personally identifiable information, like names,

							without submitting personal information). The information you
							provide is only used to fulfill a specific request, unless you
							give us permission to use it in another manner (e.g. to add you
							to one of our mailing lists). We may retain and use your personal
							information for several purposes. For instance, we may store and

						<dd>
							When you view one of our websites, we may store some information
							in the form of a "cookie" or similar file that is automatically
							downloaded to your computer. Cookies are small files that enable
							us to better customize your online experience with us. For
							instance, cookies may assist us in tailoring a web page or

							programs that can be used to damage files and your personal

							Our Use of Your Information
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of

							also use your personal information to resolve disputes,
							troubleshoot problems, inform you of services or products,
							customize your experience, or to detect and protect us against
							error, fraud or other criminal activity. We may share your
							personal information with governmental agencies or other
							companies assisting us in fraud prevention or investigation. We
							may do so when: 1) permitted or required by law; 2) trying to
							protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or
							unauthorized activity; or, 3) investigating fraud that has
							already taken place. The information provided to these entities
							is not for marketing purposes. As we develop our business, we may
							buy or sell assets or business offerings. The personal
							information we gather about you is generally considered one of
							the transferable business assets in these types of transactions.

						<dd>
							Silpada Designs cannot ensure the protection of any personal
