			<h2>Silpada Designs Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p><strong>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully prior to using this Site.  
			By using the Site, you indicate your agreement with this Privacy Policy.  
			If you do not agree to the Privacy Policy, do not use this Site.</strong></p>
			<p>Thank you for visiting our website. 
			Silpada Designs respects the privacy of every individual who visits our 
			websites and online areas. We are committed to protecting the privacy of the 
			visitors to our websites and our Independent Representatives. 
			This Policy outlines the information Silpada Designs will collect and how we 
			will use that information. It applies to your use of <a href="http://silpada.com">silpada.com</a>, 
			and any other website owned or operated by Silpada Designs. 
				</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Collection of Information</dt>
				<dd>We collect personally identifiable information, like names, postal 
				addresses, email addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted by our visitors 
				(you are free to browse our sites without submitting personal information). 
				The information you provide is only used to fulfill a specific request, 
				unless you give us permission to use it in another manner (e.g. to add you 
				to one of our mailing lists). We may retain and use your personal 
				information for several purposes. For instance, we may store and process 
				your information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our 
				products and services. We may also use your email address to send you updates
				 about new products. Silpada Designs does not intend to collect any personal 
				 information (such as name, address, telephone number, age or email address)
				  from persons under the age of 18. </dd>
				<dt>Cookies and Tracking Technology</dt>
				<dd>When you view one of our websites, we may store some information in the
				form of a "cookie" or similar file that is automatically downloaded to your 
				computer. Cookies are small files that enable us to better customize your 
				online experience with us. For instance, cookies may assist us in tailoring 
				a web page or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. 
				Information gathered through cookies may include the date and time of visits,
				 the pages viewed, the time spent at our website, and websites visited just 
				 before and just after visiting our websites. Please be assured that cookies
				  are safe. They are not programs that can be used to damage files and your
				   personal information cannot be gathered from them. You are always free 
				   to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case, 
				   you may not be able to use certain features on our site. In addition,
				   Silpada Designs may log the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of the 
				   location from where you are visiting our websites. This is a security 
				   measure to protect our company information and detect fraud. </dd>
				<dt>Our Use of Your Information</dt>
				<dd>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of 
				administering and expanding our business activities, providing customer 
				service and making available other products and services to our Independent 
				Representatives and online visitors. We may also use your personal 
				information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, inform you of 
				services or products, customize your experience, or to detect and protect 
				us against error, fraud or other criminal activity. We may share your 
				personal information with governmental agencies or other companies 
				assisting us in fraud prevention or investigation. We may do so when: 1) 
				permitted or required by law; 2) trying to protect against or prevent 
				actual or potential fraud or unauthorized activity; or, 3) investigating 
				fraud that has already taken place. The information provided to these 
				entities is not for marketing purposes. As we develop our business, 
				we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. The personal information 
				we gather about you is generally considered one of the transferable 
				business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer 
				such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, 
				or any dissolution. </dd>
			<dt>Links to Other Sites</dt>
			<dd>Silpada Designs cannot ensure the protection of any personal information 
			that you provide to a third party website that links to or from any of our 
			websites, since these third party sites are owned and operated independently. 
			These third party sites may have their own separate privacy policies that are 
			beyond our control. As such, we cannot assume responsibility or liability 
			whatsoever for practices, actions or policies of these third party sites. </dd>
			<dt>Security</dt>
			<dd>We understand that you may be concerned about the privacy and 
			confidentiality of your personal information. Rest assured that we have 
			taken precautions to ensure that this information is safe and secure. 
			Only authorized employees, agents or contractors (who have agreed to 
			keep your information secure and confidential) have access to this information.
			 That being said, please be aware that no data transmission over the 
			 Internet will be 100% secure. While we take steps to protect your personal 
			 information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you 
			 transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. </dd>
			 <dt>Revisions to Privacy Policy</dt>
			 <dd>We reserve the right to change or revise this Policy at any time. 
			 You should periodically visit this page to determine the current 
			 Privacy Policy.  Your continued use of our websites, following the posting 
			 of changes to this Privacy Policy, will signify your acceptance of those 
			 changes.</dd>
