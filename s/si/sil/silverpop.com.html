                                                            Silverpop typically asks for additional information when a customer or visitor requests information

                                                            Customers and visitors can choose to "opt out" of providing this additional information.<br><br>

                                                            Silverpop uses the collected information to set up accounts for customers and their respective 
                                                            companies. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss their interest

                                                            check qualifications of prospective customers and to invoice our customers for their usage of 
                                                            Silverpop products and services. This billing information is not used by Silverpop for marketing 
                                                            and/or promotional purposes.<br><br>

                                                            Silverpop uses a third party for credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the 
                                                            distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided except 
                                                            for the sole purpose of credit card processing.<br><br>

                                                            Silverpop uses pixel tags and other methods to gather information about the e-mails we send to our

                                                            tiny graphic files that are included in our HTML-encoded e-mail messages. When such a message is 
                                                            opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer will access Silverpop's servers 
                                                            to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing Silverpop to record and store information such as e-mail 
                                                            address, date and time the recipient viewed the e-mail message, if the recipient's e-mail program 
                                                            is capable of receiving HTML, and other logging information. Silverpop uses this information to 
                                                            optimize delivery of future messages to specific recipients and to provide information to
