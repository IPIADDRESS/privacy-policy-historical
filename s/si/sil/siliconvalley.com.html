<a href="http://www.SiliconValley.com">SiliconValley.com</a> is a part
of the <a href="http://www.realcities.com" target="_new">Real
Cities Network
(RCN)</a>, a national network of Web sites in the United States.
SiliconValley.com, along with the Real Cities Network, is committed
to protecting your privacy. The following FAQ for both SiliconValley.com and the entire Real
Cities Network should answer most of your important questions. However,
if you still have concerns, please send email to <a href="mailto:passport_feedback@realcities.com">passport_feedback@realcities.com</a>.<p>
In order to provide convenient and personalized service to our Web
site visitors, SiliconValley.com uses a variety of
systems to collect and store customer information. You can take advantage
of these systems by signing up for a Passport. As 
a Passport holder, you will enjoy a growing range of interactive features, 
including community sites, free email, 
chat rooms, shopping guide, email news dispatches,
valuable promotions and sweepstakes, premium content, and more.
</p><p>In addition to improving your online experience, knowing a bit
more about you allows <u>us</u> to display advertising to you in a
more intelligent fashion.&nbsp; Targeted advertisements are probably more
interesting for you, and they are definitely more productive for our
advertisers.
</p><p>For all these reasons, Passports are an exciting development for Real
Cities sites. We understand how important your privacy is to you, and
we hope that the following answers will&nbsp;reassure you that the information
you have given us will not be misused.

<p><a name="question1"><b>Does SiliconValley.com ask for personal information?</b></a>
<br>Yes. A Real Cities Passport consists of four basic elements: a login name,
a password, an email address, and a postal code.&nbsp;  Over time, however,
your Passport will grow with you. For example, when we introduce the ability to share
Passport information,
you may wish to create a public profile in order to let other
Passport holders get to know you better. When we introduce interactive features,
such as personalized news or classified agents, you will be able to add these preferences to
your Passport as well, so you don't have to keep retyping them. 
Also, any time you take advantage of special promotions or sweepstakes for Passport holders,
we will add any additional data collected to your Passport record.

</p><p>
</p><p><a name="question2"><b>What other information does SiliconValley.com collect?</b></a>
<br>In order to determine what the most popular areas of our site are, SiliconValley.com 
also keeps track of on-site traffic, i.e. page views and ad impressions.  Over time, in
order to anticipate your needs and to improve the product, we may link these usage patterns 
with individual customers or groups of customers.
</p><p><a href="#faq">Back to questions</a> | <a href="#top">Top</a><br>
</p><p>
</p><p><a name="question3"><b>How does SiliconValley.com use this information?</b></a>
<br>SiliconValley.com uses customer information in non-intrusive, common sense ways.
First, storing user identity and preference information allows SiliconValley.com 
to greet you when you return to the site as well as to keep track of your onsite preferences, such as
Email News subscriptions. Second, SiliconValley.com writers and product managers 
review our customer information in aggregate in order to better understand who our audience
is and what you want. Finally, tracking customer information allows us to sell targeted 
advertising. While we may not always get it right, we think that you will be more interested in 
banner ads that have something to do with your news interests and/or home Zip Code. Targeted 
ads are also far more efficient for advertisers. This is especially good because 
advertising dollars pay the bills and allow us to provide SiliconValley.com to you for free.
</p><p><a href="#faq">Back to questions</a> | <a href="#top">Top</a><br>
</p><p>
</p><p><a name="question4"><b>How does SiliconValley.com target advertising?</b></a>
<br>When a Passport holder makes use of one of our services, such as a
dispatches of sports stories delivered via email, we "remember" that the user
is interested in sports.  Then, when an advertiser wants to reach
an audience of sports fans, we simply serve the advertisements to those
users who we have been flagged as sports fans. Alternatively, if a local
grocery market wants to inform its customers of an upcoming sale, we can display
that advertisement to Passport holders with relevant Zip Codes.  It
is important to note that in such cases it is our policy NOT to share the details of
your Passport information with the advertiser. We act as the middleman
between you and the companies that want to reach you.
</p><p><a href="#faq">Back to questions</a> | <a href="#top">Top</a><br>
</p><p>
</p><p><a name="question5"><b>Will SiliconValley.com disclose any of my personal
information?</b></a>
<br>SiliconValley.com will disclose personal information in some limited circumstances.
When SiliconValley.com intends to disclose information, the purpose will be explained 
to you beforehand:<br>
- From time to time, SiliconValley.com will run sweepstakes or promotions for 
Passport holders. In most cases, you will be required to provide additional information
on in order to participate in
the event, and some of this data may be 
provided to the sponsor of the promotion.
Of course, we will explain the nature of the promotion, and
you will always have the option not to participate in it. Also, you will not 
be signed up without your express consent.<br>
- SiliconValley.com does disclose aggregated user statistics
(for example, 55% of our users come from the Southwest) in order to describe
our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties,
and for other lawful purposes.  However, aggregate data is not traceable to
a specific user.<br>
- When SiliconValley.com decides to integrate 3rd party services which depend upon
customer information, such as online email or personalized stock quotes, we 
may share some elements of our 
customer records (such as an email address) with the third party. Such partners, 
as well as Internet sites 
and services accessible through SiliconValley.com, may have separate privacy and data collection 
practices, independent of SiliconValley.com.  It is our policy to notify
you of any differences between their policies and our own. However, 
SiliconValley.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies 
or the actions of non-affiliated third parties.<br>
- It is important to note that although SiliconValley.com will use all reasonable efforts to 
safeguard the privacy of your personal information, transmissions made by means of the Internet 
cannot be made absolutely secure. SiliconValley.com will have no liability for disclosure 
of data due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties.<br>
- Finally, SiliconValley.com will cooperate fully should a situation arise where we 
are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer.

</p><p>
</p><p><a name="question7"><b>Will SiliconValley.com use my information for direct
mailings?</b></a>
<br>Only with your permission. With your express consent, we 
will send you information about our products and services, or other
products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only SiliconValley.com (or
agents working on behalf of SiliconValley.com) will send you these direct mailings. At 
any time you can easily update your Passport such that
you no longer receive such offers and mailings.
</p><p><a href="#faq">Back to questions</a> | <a href="#top">Top</a><br>
</p><p>
</p><p><a name="question6"><b>Does SiliconValley.com use Cookies and IP Addresses?</b></a>
<br>Yes.  If you choose "Automatic Login" when you sign up for a Passport, SiliconValley.com stores a scrambled version of your Passport login name in a permanent
"Cookie" file on your hard drive so that we can remember who you are from one 
visit to the next. If you do not choose "Automatic Login", we will use a temporary Cookie
after you log in (which expires after each visit) to keep track of you
as you move from page to page during a given visit to our site.  Without
these Cookies, it is impossible for us to provide any level of personalized
service or to target advertising. In addition, some of our sites
and advertising systems may set additional cookies which contain no personal
information whatsoever.
</p><p>In order to enable automatic log in as well as fast entry to our various
services, Passport keeps three key data elements in your Cookie: your
Passport Login Name, Zip Code, and Email Address. To protect your privacy,
each cookie is scrambled using a proprietary encryption algorithm.  Think
of these Cookies as "claim checks". Like a coat room clerk, we use the
Cookie to help us keep track of your information on our systems. To anyone
other than us, the information stored in your Cookies is meaningless. 
</p><p>You might wonder if another Web site or online user would be able to
steal your Passport login name from your cookie? The answer is no. Only
SiliconValley.com or other Real Cities sites can read the information about your Passport Login Name. 
Due to the design of Web servers and browsers, no other Web site has access to
your SiliconValley.com Cookie and vice versa. However, if you have chosen Automatic Login,
anyone who sits down at your computer can log on to the site using your
Passport information.  
</p><p>SiliconValley.com may also collect IP addresses for the purposes of system
administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.
</p><p><a href="#faq">Back to questions</a> | <a href="#top">Top</a><br>
</p><p>
</p><p><a name="question8"><b>Does SiliconValley.com collect credit card information or
other billing data?</b></a>
<br>Signing up for a SiliconValley.com Passport is free, as are most of the services 
that come with the Passport. In the future, we may add new features and services which
will carry a charge. If you are interested in making use of these, you may be asked to supply
credit card information or other billing data. In such case,
SiliconValley.com will provide a secure means of transferring the sensitive data
back and forth across the Internet.
</p><p><a href="#faq">Back to questions</a> | <a href="#top">Top</a><br>
</p><p></p><p><a name="question9"><b>Can I get rid of my Real Cities Passport?</b></a>
<br>Yes. If you want us to disable your Passport or remove it from our records, you 
may notify us by sending email to <a href="mailto:passport_feedback@realcities.com">passport_feedback@realcities.com</a>.
Please include your Passport Login Name. We will send you an email to confirm your request. When you have 
responded, we will remove your information from our database.

</p><p><a name="question10"><b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b></a>
<br>Please remember that the protection of your privacy begins with you.
You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your Passport
password, and you should always be careful and responsible whenever disclosing
information online.
