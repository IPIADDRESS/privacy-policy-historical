<b>HOW STATEN ISLAND LIVE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU:</b> This site does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. A user's personally identifiable information may be used by Staten Island Live and its affiliates for editorial purposes. Staten Island Live may also use such information for marketing and promotional purposes. We may share your personally identifiable information with other companies with which it conducts business. For example, if you enter our contests, make a purchase or use our e-mail services, we sometimes rely on outside companies to provide these services to you. In such cases, we need to provide your personally identifiable information to them. Or if you choose to purchase items through our commerce site, we will
forward your information to third parties for credit card processing and order fulfillment.  We also sometimes provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs. While Staten Island Live will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it was provided, Staten Island Live does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of any third parties.</p><p>

Except for purposes outlined above, we do not provide, sell or lease your personally identifiable information to any third parties, unless otherwise stated at the time of collection.
