<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review our <a href="/aboutus/0,10000092,10000088,00.htm">Terms of Use</a>, which govern your use of the Web Sites.</p>

<h3 class="sub">TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED</h3>
<p>The following are the types of information we may collect:</p><a name="2"></a>
<h3 class="sub">WEB SITE USAGE INFORMATION &amp; DEVICE IDENTIFIERS</h3>
<p>We may receive and store certain types of web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Web Sites. For example, we may collect the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view, other similar information and your IP address. We also may collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively referred to herein as a "Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, your mobile phone, or other device used to access the Internet, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may associate your Device Identifier with the personal information you provide. When analysed, web site usage information helps us determine how visitors arrive at the Web Sites, what type of content is most popular, and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising.</p><a name="3"></a>
<h3 class="sub">INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US</h3>
<p>We may ask you to provide us with two types of information: (1) personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, mobile phone number, and physical address; and (2) demographic information, such as gender, post code, or similar information. We may collect this information at various places and forms on the Web Sites, including registration forms for newsletters and other communications (e.g., whether by e-mail, mobile device, etc.), when you communicate or otherwise interact with us, when you submit information to us (whether or not the information is intended to be posted on the Web Sites), contests or sweepstakes, surveys or voting or when you purchase a product or service through the Web Sites. You may also be asked to choose a user name and password in order to identify yourself during future visits to the Web Sites. Do not use your real name or the name of any other actual person as your user name. Providing us with information about yourself is your choice, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Web Sites' features.</p>
<p>For your convenience, if you register with one of our Web Sites through which you create a user name and password, that user name and password may work on the other Web Sites where user names and passwords are utilised. The personal information you provide and any additional information we collect about you may be used by us and across all of the Web Sites.</p><a name="4"></a>
<p>We may receive information about you from other sources; for example, we may obtain geographic or demographic information, or information regarding your possible interests, from third parties, or we may receive information from a marketing partner in connection with a co-branded web site or promotion. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Web Sites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personal information.</p><a name="5"></a>
<h3 class="sub">SEND TO A FRIEND</h3>
<p>If you send a friend a communication from the Web Sites, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc.) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain additional consent.</p>
<p class="return-to-top"><a href="#aboutus">Return to top</a></p><a name="6"></a>
<h3 class="sub">HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED</h3><a name="7"></a>
<h3 class="sub">COOKIES</h3>
<p>The Web Sites use standard technology called "cookies" which are small data files that are transferred to your computer (or other Internet-accessing device) when you visit the Web Sites and allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your web browser to the Web Sites whenever you visit the Web Sites, and may make navigating and using the Web Sites easier for you. Also, by tracking how and when you use the Web Sites, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Web Sites are based on data obtained from cookies. Additionally, accepting cookies may allow you to, among other things, personalise your experience on the Web Sites. Cookies may also allow the Web Sites to present to you advertising that may be of interest to you as well as limit how often you see certain ads that may detract from your user experience on our Web Sites. If you do not want to allow information to be collected through the use of cookies, you can generally opt out of providing this information by setting your browser to reject cookies. However, please be aware that some areas of the Web Sites may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.</p><a name="8"></a>
<h3 class="sub">WEB BEACONS</h3>
<p>The Web Sites and any communications sent by the Web Sites may contain electronic images (generally, single-pixel ".gif" images) called "web beacons." These web beacons allow Company and third parties to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document, e-mail message or other communication, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the Device Identifier of the device that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Company's use of web beacons on its Web Sites, include, without limitation, the following:</p>
<ul class="misc">
<li>Counting unique users (actually, unique web browsers), visits and page views. 
</li><li>Monitoring traffic and conversion patterns through our various product and service offerings on the Web Sites. For example, web beacons may be integrated into a merchandise product page as well as the subsequent shopping cart, transaction and verification pages. 
</li><li>Personalising your experience when you visit the Web Sites, including the advertising and content you see. 
</li><li>Determining whether or not messages were opened, links were clicked or notifications/offers were acted upon. </li></ul>
<p class="return-to-top"><a href="#aboutus">Return to top</a></p><a name="9"></a>
<h3 class="sub">HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
<p>The information you provide to us may be used to:<br></p>
<ul class="misc">
<li>Send you newsletters and/or other communications for which you have registered; 
</li><li>Contact you about the Web Sites, including, without limitation, in our discretion to notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy, the Web Site's Terms of Use, or other policies that affect your use of the Web Sites; 
</li><li>Contact you or share your personal data and/or business information with third party organisations we partner with and whose content and/or other offerings you choose to download via an email offer we may send you and/or that you download from the CBS Interactive Web Sites with regard to offers or promotional materials either on behalf of ourselves or third parties; 
</li><li>Confirm or fulfil an order you have made;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</li><li>Contact you with regard to a sweepstakes, contest or promotion in which you have participated; 
</li><li>Authorise a purchase or complete a transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the products or other services that you ordered, and, if necessary, to invoice you; 
</li><li>Monitor or improve the Web Sites; 
</li><li>Administer the Web Sites' systems and for other internal business purposes; 
</li><li>Customise the advertising and content you see; 
</li><li>Comply with and monitor compliance with our Terms of Use and other applicable agreements and polices; and 
</li><li>For other purposes disclosed when you provide your information. </li></ul>
<p>Moreover, if you submit to Company and/or the Web Sites comments, photographs, videos, music, text or other content, it may be published online or offline (including on-air, on a CD or DVD, through wireless distribution, and transmission of soft copies, or any other media or format currently existing or hereafter developed), and we may publish your name, voice, likeness and other personal information in connection with publishing the content or a portion of the content, and we may use the content and any excerpt from the content in connection with advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities. Please also see "Information You Submit" in our Terms of Use, which governs any content you submit through the Web Sites.</p>
<p>Please note that information submitted to the Web Sites via a "contact us," or other similar mechanisms will not necessarily receive a response. We will not use any such information you provide to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request.</p>
<p class="return-to-top"><a href="#aboutus">Return to top</a></p><a name="10"></a>
<h3 class="sub">THIRD-PARTY AD SERVING&nbsp;AND AUDIENCE AND TRAFFIC MEASUREMENT SERVICES</h3>
<p>The Web Sites may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Web Sites and may use a traffic measurement service to analyse traffic on the Web Sites. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Web Sites and other web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Although advertisers and other companies do not have access to cookies set by the Web Sites, the Web Sites' third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser. These third party cookies are set to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. While we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Web Sites, you may wish to visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" title="Networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>, which provides information regarding the "opt-out" procedures of certain third party ad servers we may use.</p>
<p>In the UK, CBS Interactive has engaged with <a href="http://www.audiencescience.com/uk/index.asp">Audience Science</a> to help tailor ads on CBS Interactive Web Sites in the UK. Audience Science will select ads that it believes are likely to be of interest to you based on information about your activity on this and other websites. This information is collected by Audience Science through cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, either on our site or elsewhere on the internet, and is anonymous in that it does not include your name, street address, email address or telephone number. All information that Audience Science collects about your online activities is collected and processed in accordance with Audience Science's <a href="http://www.audiencescience.com/uk/privacy.asp">privacy policy</a>, and not this privacy policy. Audience Science is a signatory to the Internet Advertising Bureau's <a href="http://www.iabuk.net/en/1/iableadsbehaviouraladvertisinggoodpractice030309.mxs">Good Practice Principles for Online Behavioural Targeting</a>. For more information on online behavioural advertising in the UK, about cookies, about the good practice principles adopted by Audience Science, and about how to <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">opt out</a> of receiving targeted advertising from Audience Science, please visit <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.co.uk/">www.youronlinechoices.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h3 class="sub">SWEEPSTAKES, CONTESTS AND PROMOTIONS</h3>
<p>We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions through the Web Sites that may require registration. If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, your personal information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with the administration of such promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfilment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list. Also, by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion.</p><a name="17"></a>
<h3 class="sub">BUSINESS TRANSFERS</h3>
<p>Company shares the information collected through the Web Sites with and among the Web Sites, and may share the information with its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates. Company or any of it assets, including the Web Sites, may be sold, or other transactions may occur in which your personal information is one of the key business assets for the transaction.

<h3 class="sub">THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES</h3>

For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Web Sites onto a different web site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Web Sites' logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.
