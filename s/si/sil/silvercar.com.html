<html><head></head><body><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">This is the United States privacy notice ("Privacy Notice") of Silvercar, Inc. ("Silvercar," "we," "us," or "our").</p>

<p>We at Silvercar recognize the importance of protecting your personally identifiable information. To demonstrate our commitment to maintaining the privacy of your personally identifiable information, we have created this Privacy Notice to disclose our privacy practices for the personally identifiable information that we collect and receive through use of our products and services either offline or online. Our online operations include all websites(collectively, the "Websites") and applications (defined below as “Apps”) of Silvercar.</p>

<p>By submitting your personally identifiable information to us, you consent to Silvercar's use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as set forth in this Privacy Notice. Your use and/or continued use of Silvercar products, services and websites signifies your consent that your information may be transferred to or stored on servers and processed outside the country of your residence. Provided the data protection laws of these other countries differ from those in the United States, please be assured that we take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Notice, please do not submit any information to Silvercar either offline or through our Apps or Websites.</p>

<h3>Purpose of this Privacy Notice</h3>

<p>We recognize the importance of protecting your personally identifiable information (which includes your name, address, telephone number, date of birth, e-mail address, credit or debit card information, drivers license number, and other contact information,) that you provide to Silvercar (collectively, "PII"). The purpose of this Privacy Notice is to tell you how Silvercar strives to better serve you by keeping you informed of promotions, products and services, while, at the same time, safeguarding your PII. This Privacy Notice sets forth our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your PII both through our online and offline operations. This Privacy Notice also explains how you can correct or change the PII we hold about you, or opt-out of receiving certain marketing materials.</p>

<h3>Who is Covered under this Privacy Notice</h3>

<p>This Privacy Notice is applicable to PII that you provide to Silvercar. This Privacy Notice applies to all of the products, services, Apps and Websites offered by Silvercar or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.</p>

<h3>What Personally Identifiable Information Silvercar Collects</h3>

<p>You generally are not required to provide us with PII when visiting our Websites. However, when you create an account, make a reservation, rent a vehicle, and/or join one of our programs, we need to collect certain information about you to provide or improve our services. The service that you choose will determine what information we collect from you. Here are some examples of information we collect from you:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email Address</li>
    <li>Home and/or Business Address</li>
    <li>Telephone Numbers at which we can contact you</li>
    <li>Date of Birth</li>
    <li>Payment Information (i.e. debit or credit card and expiration date)</li>
    <li>Information from your Driver's License or other Government issued identification (e.g., Passport)</li>
</ol>

<p>When you rent a vehicle, we will also record non-personally identifiable information about your rental (e.g. where you rented the vehicle, where and when you returned the vehicle, payment arrangements, insurance preferences, gas consumption, mileage and other information related to the vehicle). This information is necessary in order to administer your rental reservation and/or process your transaction.</p>

<p>We may also need certain information from you when you request any of the following services or equipment: Special Needs/Optional Equipment; Special Offers/Discounts; Partner Member Numbers; use of a corporate or other discount number and other vehicle preferences. For example, if you wish to use a discount that Silvercar provides to members of an association/affiliate to which you belong, we may collect information about your membership to verify and provide you with the correct discount for our services.</p>

<h3>How Silvercar Collects Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

<p>The PII we collect from you will be with your express or implied consent. How we collect this information will depend on how you use our services. We may collect this information directly from you by telephone, fax, postal mail, email, at the customer suite, upon completion of an application or enrollment form, or through your use of our Websites, mobile applications (“Apps”) or the Internet. To the extent you use our Websites or Apps, we may also collect information about your use of our Websites and Apps, transactional and account information, e-mail and other information related to communications to our Websites or through our Apps. We may also collect information about you indirectly through a travel agent, an account program in which you or your employer participates or through one of our partner programs when you deal with us through those means. Additionally, our affiliates and third parties may provide us with information about you.</p>

<p>You may choose not to provide some of your PII to us, but this may prevent us from providing our services to you, or limit our ability to provide you with the level of service that you would otherwise expect from us.</p>

<p>Silvercar vehicles may be equipped with a device that allows Silvercar to use a global positioning satellite to track, locate and/or disable the vehicle and to provide such information and capability to law enforcement agencies at any time and especially if you fail to return the vehicle when and where required under your rental agreement with Silvercar or otherwise violate any provision of the rental agreement.</p>

<h3>How Personally Identifiable Information is Used and Disclosed by Silvercar</h3>

<i>Usage</i>

<p>We strive to ensure that we give you a stress-free rental experience and are dedicated to building a rewarding and lasting relationship with every customer. To provide the level of service we believe you expect from us, we may use your PII for the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Provide and administer the services that you request, and communicate with you regarding such services and offerings;</li>
    <li>Research, develop, manage, protect and improve our Websites and services;</li>
    <li>Maintain and develop our service-oriented software and other business systems; and</li>
    <li>Analyze data, or to have a third party do so on our behalf.</li>
</ol>

<p>We may also use your information - both PII and non-personally identifiable information - for other purposes. For example, PII may be needed to process and track your transactions or to send you information about our affiliates' and business partners' products and services and other information and materials that may be of interest to you. If you use our Websites, we may also use your information to evaluate what portions of our Websites are visited more often than others, determine where visitors came from, where they go, and how long they stay on a particular page, or on our Websites in general.</p>

<p>From time to time, we also may combine your PII with information obtained from other sources, including third parties, in order to provide you with more customized services and product offerings. To do this, it is often necessary to share your information with trusted vendors and business partners, such as companies that manage accounts, offer affinity, frequent-user, and reward programs, and companies that perform marketing services and other business operations for us. For more information, see below under "Disclosing."</p>

<i>Disclosing<i>

<p>We may disclose your PII to affiliated and non-affiliated organizations including, for example:</p>
<ol>
   <li> To your company or organization if you use our services under a corporate or other commercial account;</li>
    <li>To one of our program partners (e.g. if you are a member of an affiliate program, such as a relocation company or frequent traveler program and you have asked us to send details of your rental agreement with us to obtain your benefits from that program);</li>
    <li>To entities that provide services on our behalf;</li>
    <li>To any intermediary you use, such as a travel agent, broker or booking engine, in relation to any aspect of your rental;</li>
    <li>To independent licensees for use in providing the services and offerings which you have requested and to communicate with you regarding such services and offerings;</li>
    <li>To your credit card issuer;</li>
    <li>To credit reporting and fraud checking agencies;</li>
    <li>To debt collection agencies, if you fail to pay monies owed to us;</li>
    <li>To government or private organizations responsible for the processing or handling of traffic or parking related violations;</li>
    <li>To driver licensing authorities, directly or through intermediary organizations, when needed to verify compliance with Silvercar's safe driver criteria for qualified drivers and/or to verify license information; and</li>
    <li>To government, regulatory and law enforcement agencies where the disclosure is required or authorized by law, and otherwise as we believe is necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation or other governmental request, to operate our Websites and Apps properly, or to protect or defend our rights or the rights or well-being of our employees, users or others or if you are involved (or are suspected by governmental authorities or our security functions to be involved) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order.</li>
</ol>

<p>We may disclose your PII to our affiliates and non-affiliated business partners for their use both on our behalf and for their own business purposes. For example, our affiliates and business partners may use such PII to send you information about their products and services and other information and materials that may be of interest to you. You may <a href="/">opt-out</a> of us disclosing your PII for these purposes through one of the methods described in this Privacy Notice.</p>

These types of third parties are not permitted to use your PII for any secondary purposes.</p>

<p>We may also transfer or assign your PII to third parties as a result of or in connection with a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of assets, reorganization, or liquidation.</p>

<p>We may need to send your PII overseas as part of our normal business operations. Provided the data protection laws of these other countries differ from those in the United States, please be assured that we take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected.</p>

<h3>Website and Internet Privacy</h3>

<p>If you use our Apps or Websites or otherwise interact with us via the Internet, the following privacy-related policies also apply:</p>

<h3>Website Tracking and the Use of Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>

<p>If you use our Websites, certain information may be collected from your computer in the course of your use of our Websites. As with many websites, we may use both session based and persistent "cookies" and/or other technology (e.g., web bugs, e-mail bugs, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracker GIFs and "clickstream" data logs) in our Websites or in our electronic communications with you to enhance the functionality of our Websites and services. These technologies also make your transactions and other activities more convenient and efficient.</p>

<i>Cookies</i>

<p>"Cookies" are small amounts of data that a website can send to your web browser and store on your computer. It is our policy not to save sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card information in cookies.</p>

 <p>Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You have the option of disabling or refusing cookies at any time in your browser preferences. However, note that some parts of our Websites will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences, and/or may have difficulty completing transactions.</p>

<p>The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, you will find that most major websites use them. Silvercar and Silvercar's affiliates have two (2) primary uses for cookies. First, we use them to specify a user's preferences. For example, we use cookies to store information about your travel preferences or rental history so you don't have to tell us repeatedly your preferences. Second, we use cookies to track Website usage trends and patterns. This helps us understand our users' needs better and improve areas of our Websites.</p>

<i>IP Addresses</i>

<p>An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet so that your computer can be identified on the Internet. This allows us to gather useful information and data about our customers' use of the site.</p>

<p>Silvercar collects IP addresses for the purposes of: helping us diagnose problems with our main computers, for system administration, to report aggregated information to our business partners, and to audit the use of our Website. When users request Web pages from our Web Site, our Web servers log the User's IP address. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user will remain anonymous to us. For example, we collect and/or track the home server domain name, the type of computer, and the type of Web browser used by you to access this Web Site. Such collection and tracking information is gathered by us as you navigate through our Websites, and will be used by us for our business purposes only.</p>

<p>In select instances, we may use IP addresses to help us identify you when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Website <a href="/agreements/terms_and_conditions">Terms of Use</a> or to protect our service, site, users or others.</p>

<i>Third Party Use of Technology</i>

<p>Third parties (including, but not limited to, software vendors, advertisers, ad servers, content providers, and services providers) may also use similar technologies by or through our Apps or Websites or through their own websites. In connection therewith, such entities may collect information about you and your usage activity on this and other websites. Silvercar does not control these third parties and is not responsible for the actions of our third party business partners. We encourage you to check their terms of use and privacy policies for such information.</p>

<p>We may use third-party servicing technology and service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on our Apps or Websites. They may collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Websites, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to send you targeted advertisements for goods and services. This information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, or similar technology which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this non-personally identifiable information used, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>

<p>We may also share Website usage information about visitors to our Websites with selected third parties for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on our Websites and other websites. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by our third-party ad server on our Site. In connection therewith, such third parties may have access to and use non-personalized information about your online usage activity. The use of advertising cookies and web beacons sent by such third-party Web servers is standard for commercial activity in the Internet industry.</p>

<i>Web Beacons</i>

<p>Web pages may contain an electronic file called a web beacon that allows a website to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.</p>

<h3>Visiting Third-Party Websites</h3>

<p>Our Websites may contain links or references to third party websites. These websites are outside of our control, and the privacy policies of these sites may differ from our own. Please be aware that we have no control over these third-party websites and our Privacy Notice does not apply to such websites. We encourage you to check the terms of use and privacy policies of such sites before disclosing any PII via such sites.</p>

<p>Occasionally when linking to a third-party website from our Websites, you may still see Silvercar affiliate logo or a Silvercar affiliate website frame. This is to provide you with a seamless experience when visiting our Websites. In these cases, you are no longer on our Websites but the third-party website, and therefore the information collection practices of the third party's website may differ from Silvercar's. The privacy notice of the third party site will govern how information collected from you is used by the owner of the website. You can always know what website you are on by checking the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the location bar within your browser.</p>

<h3>Linking your Silvercar Accounts to Your Social Profiles</h3>

<i>Social Authentication</i>

<i>Social Sharing</i>

<p>In an effort to provide our customers with new ways of sharing content, we may enable some of our online content to be shared on social websites through hosted sharing links and icons. Users who share content and links through their social media profiles should be aware that all activities of this nature are public.</p>

<p>Please note, when you share (with or without adding your own comments) any of our content on your social media profile, that action is governed by the privacy notice of that social media platform, and not Silvercar's Privacy Notice.

<p>The security of your PII is important to us.

It is our policy to retain PII for as long as we believe appropriate for the purposes for which the PII was collected or as required by applicable law.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any such information via e-mail or to a website that is not on such domain name, please do not provide such information, and report such request to our privacy officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@silvercar.com">privacy@silvercar.com</a>.</p>
