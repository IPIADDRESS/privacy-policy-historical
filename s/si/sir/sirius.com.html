<p>
This Privacy Policy governs SIRIUS Satellite Radio Inc.’s (“we”, “us” or " SIRIUS") treatment of personally identifiable information that SIRIUS collects when you use the sirius.com website or our online media player (the "Site”) and when you provide information to us in any medium for the SIRIUS Satellite Radio Service, SIRIUS Internet Radio or any other service offered by SIRIUS (the “SIRIUS Service”).
<br><br>
Sirius.com is owned by SIRIUS. SIRIUS values your privacy and is dedicated to protecting your personal information and providing you with:
<br><br>
<b>Notice</b><br>
What personally identifiable information we collect<br>
How the information is used<br>
With whom the information may be shared<br>
<br><br>
<b>Consent</b><br>
What choices you have regarding collection, use and distribution of that information <br><br>

<b>Security</b><br>
Procedures we use to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of that information <br><br>

<b>Access</b><br>
How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information we have collected from you 
<br><br>
<b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b><br><br>

Tracking Technology.  SIRIUS logs IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Site.  We may track your movement within the Site, the third-party website pages from which you were referred, your use of the media player, access times and browser types.  We use this information to gauge the effectiveness of our Site, track information for statistical purposes and to improve the products and services we provide.  We store information that we collect through cookies, log files and other tracking technology such as clear gifs.  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies on the Site.  We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.  Persistent cookies are used to differentiate users of the Site from subscribers, to customize the content of certain sections of the Site and to enable us to track and cater to the interests of users, in order to enhance their experience on the Site.  If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas of the Site may be limited and you may not be able to use certain features of the Site, including ordering hardware, subscribing to the SIRIUS Service, listening to music online, suggesting songs or entering sweepstakes or contests.
<br><br>
Supplemental Information.  We may supplement the information you provide us by acquiring commercially available demographic and marketing information from third parties, for instance, to verify your address or to update your information and to create a profile of your preferences.  We tie your personally identifiable information to information in the profile, in order to improve the content of the Site for you or to inform you about products or services that we think will be of interest to you. We may also receive information from the retailer, dealer, or automaker from whom you obtained your satellite radio.
<br><br>
Users.  We collect information you provide to us when you purchase products from us and when you subscribe to and/or use the SIRIUS Service.  For example, you may provide us a billing address and credit card information, including your name, address, email address and telephone number, when you become a user of the SIRIUS Service or perhaps purchase a product through our online store.  When you register online to subscribe, purchase and/or use the SIRIUS Service, you must complete a registration form that may require you to provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address and telephone number. Our online registration forms may also request your date of birth.
<br><br>
You must be at least eighteen (18) years old or the age of majority pursuant to the laws in the state in which you reside to register online for the SIRIUS Service or promotions. If you are a minor please do not submit any personally identifiable information to us.  We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or sell products or services to people under 18.
<br><br>
Third Party Links. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of websites you visit that collect personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies only to information collected by us on the Site and collected when you subscribe to or use the SIRIUS Service or purchase products from us.
<br><br>
Advertisements. We may from time to time use various outside ad-serving companies and affiliates to serve advertisements on the Site.  In the process of serving advertisements, the ad serving companies may place a cookie in your browser's cookie file and may use information about your visits to the Site  and other websites in order to provide advertisements on the Site about products and services that may be of interest to you.  By delivering ads on the Site, the ad-server is able to record what ads a user -- identified by the unique cookie -- has seen, and what pages the user was viewing when the ads were delivered.  This web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information the ad-server has collected from your visits to the Site and other websites not affiliated with SIRIUS. This non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad-serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you see online at the Site and other websites not affiliated with SIRIUS.
<br><br>
Surveys or Promotions. From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes, contests or other promotions promoted on the Site, which might be sponsored or conducted by SIRIUS or by a third party.  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.  Participation in these promotions is completely voluntary and you will have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information.  If there is a third party sponsor involved please make sure to review that third party’s privacy policy.
<br><br>
<b>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>
<br><br>
Our Use.  We receive and store any personal information you enter on the Site or give to us voluntarily in any other way and may use it to contact you from time to time.  Specifically, by registering on the Site, or by subscribing to the SIRIUS Service and providing your telephone number, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of telemarketing laws.  Regardless of the fact that your telephone and/or cell number may be listed with the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry, or your local State Do-Not-Call list, you expressly consent to receive future information about products and services from us, and in, that regard, you hereby consent to our contacting you pursuant to the business relationship established using the information you provided to us.  This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, phone and/or cell number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving (e.g. video etc.).  We may also send you information or offers from time to time to the postal address or email address we have on file.  If you provide us with information when you request that a song or other content be played on the SIRIUS Service, we may use your information to announce your name and request on the air.  If you provide your name for a promotional offer to enter a sweepstakes or contest, and win a prize, we will post a winner’s list online, and will file your name with state agencies if required by law.  We do not knowingly market or sell the SIRIUS Service to, or knowingly solicit information from,  anyone who is under 18.
<br><br>
Vendors.  We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples might include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links and providing customer service.  They have access to your personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
<br><br>
Third Party Offers.  We share personally identifiable information with third parties in order to have them send you special offers and promotions or other information we think you might find of interest.  We ourselves will also occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, promotions, or information which we have found that may be of interest to our users and subscribers.  If you do not want us to use the information you provide in order to inform you of products and services we think might interest you, or provide your information to third party companies, it is your obligation to please let us know, by contacting our privacy administrator at privacyadministrator@sirius.com.
<br><br>
Other Uses.  We may use your personal information to contact you about the SIRIUS Service, or for other purposes in which you have expressed an interest, for example, if you have contacted customer service or made an inquiry.
<br><br>
Service Related Announcements. We will provide you with service and account related announcements on occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the delivery of a service or product is delayed we might send you an email, or other message, or if there is some service issue with something you might have ordered.  Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to cancel your subscription or order by calling us at 888-539-7474.
<br><br>
Exceptional Circumstances.  If SIRIUS or any of its lines of businesses or affiliated companies, is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, the relevant databases of SIRIUS could, in whole or in part, be sold as part of that transaction.  Therefore, information about our subscribers, users of the Site and the SIRIUS Service, including personal information, will be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide the Site or the SIRIUS Service, or sale or pledge of our company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.  Information about our users, including personal information, may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where SIRIUS , or an affiliate, seeks financing, investment, support or funding.  We also may have to release personally identifying information when it is necessary to comply with judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, orders, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of SIRIUS or others.
<br><br>
SIRIUS ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY WITH REGARD TO ANY THEFT, LOSS, ALTERATION OR MISUSE OF PERSONAL OR OTHER INFORMATION LAWFULLY PROVIDED BY SIRIUS TO THIRD PARTIES, OR WITH REGARD TO THE FAILURE OF ANY THIRD PARTY TO ABIDE BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THAT THIRD PARTY AND SIRIUS.
<br><br>
