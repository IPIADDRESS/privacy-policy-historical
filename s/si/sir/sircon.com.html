Some of our sites collect information about your hardware  and software in order to provide a requested service. </p>
        <h2>Use of your Personal  Information</h2>
        <p>The personal information collected on this Site will be  used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the  transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. In support of these uses,  Sircon may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer  service, to improve the Site and any related Sircon products or services. We  may use your personal information to provide you with important information  about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and  notifications. Additionally, we may send you information about other Sircon  products and services.

For example, we store the personal information you provide on  computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities.

        <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of  the registration process and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text  file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be  used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely  assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued  the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a  convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web  page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your  specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of  delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return  to the Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so  you can easily use the site's features that you customized. Web beacons, also  known as clear gif technology, or action tags, may be used to assist in  delivering the cookie on our site. This technology is a tool we use to compile  aggregated statistics about Sircon Web site usage, such as how many visitors  clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a Sircon Web page, blog  or a newsletter. We may share aggregated site statistics with partner  companies. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers  automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting  to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not  be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other Web sites  you visit. </p>
        <h2>Enforcement of this  Privacy Statement</h2>

        <p>If you have questions regarding this statement, you  should contact Sircon and <a href="mailto:info@sircon.com">info@sircon.com</a>. </p>
