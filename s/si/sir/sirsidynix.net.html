<p><b>Effective date of April 23, 2004</b></p>
<p><i>This page was last updated June 15, 2010</i></p>
<p>Sirsi Corporation, dba SirsiDynix ("SirsiDynix") is committed to protecting your privacy. We recognize your need for protection of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") shared with us. SirsiDynix has developed the following Privacy Policy in order to inform you of the care that we place on the protection, management and use of your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy Notice covers the foundation principles of fair information: Awareness, Choice, Notice, Accuracy &amp; Access, Security, Data Integrity, Enforcement, and Oversight.</p>
<p>Personal Information includes information that identifies an individual or institution; for example, a person's name, institution name, mail address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other such information used for contacting or identifying the individual or institution.</p>
<p>In order for SirsiDynix to provide the services or products that you order, Personal Information may be required to fulfill your request. The information you provide to SirsiDynix will be protected in all reasonable means from disclosure to outside parties. SirsiDynix appreciates your trust and provides this privacy policy regarding our practices for managing information. SirsiDynix also has a separate privacy statement that applies to certain personal data that SirsiDynix receives in the United States from the European Union and Switzerland, called the Safe Harbor Privacy Statement.</p>
<h3>DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES WHEN PERSONAL INFORMATION IS RECEIVED FROM CLIENT.</h3>
<p>We will ask the individual or institution ("Client") when we need Personal Information. Under most circumstances when SirsiDynix requests Personal Information the Client is registering for conferences, surveys, ordering e-mail news or information, joining limited-access sites (such as forum or list servers), signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing and/or registering SirsiDynix products. Personal Information collected by SirsiDynix is often limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service or product Client requested.</p>
<p>Examples of when Personal Information is requested:</p>
<p>SirsiDynix may collect information about Client's computer hardware and software, if it was not supplied by SirsiDynix. This information may include: Client IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of SirsiDynix.</p>
<p>If a Client has selected a service or product that requires payment, we will request Personal Information necessary for billing and/or shipping, such as: name, address, telephone number, and credit card number.</p>
<p>SirsiDynix also collects information about which pages our Clients visit within SirsiDynix. This site visitation data is never linked with Personal Information, except with the user's consent as described below.</p>
<p>You can visit most pages on our site without providing any Personal Information. However, as noted in the examples above, sometimes we do need information to provide the services you request and realize you want the information you provide to SirsiDynix to be protected. SirsiDynix appreciates your trust and offers this privacy statement to inform you of our practices for managing information. Please read the complete SirsiDynix privacy statement herein, and if you choose to provide us with Personal Information, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy Notice.</p>
<p>Personal Information</p>
<p>About Personal Information:</p>
<p>Personal Information will not be sold, leased, or otherwise distributed or disclosed to outside parties unless required by law. All individual information is considered confidential.</p>
<p>Personal Information will not be collected, sold, leased, or otherwise distributed or disclosed for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Personal Information will not be collected, sold, leased or otherwise distributed or disclosed without notice being given to the individual. At that time, the individual can request the Personal Information not be shared.</p>
<p>Personal Information will not be knowingly collected by SirsiDynix from children.</p>
<p>What information is collected without Client Registration:</p>
<p>The domain name (e.g. <a href="http://www.SirsiDynix.com">www.SirsiDynix.com</a>) of the visitor.</p>
<p>The IP address of the computer or Internet provider.</p>
<p>The date/time you accessed the site.</p>
<p>How the collected information is used:</p>
<p>Measuring traffic flow and volume.</p>
<p>Diagnosing server problems.</p>
<p>Determining which parts of the site users are visiting.</p>
<p>Delivering services, for example press releases, events information, training or software, which Client requested or purchased.</p>
<p>To notify our users of product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other services.</p>
<p>To allow Client access to limited-entry Websites.</p>
<p>The collected information does not identify individual visitors, unless the individual elects to provide SirsiDynix Personal Information. IP addresses are not linked to any personal identifiers. Statistical information is used only in aggregate (sum total) anonymous form. SirsiDynix uses this data for research purposes only and we may use this information in aggregate anonymous form to create statistical information. In some cases, with Client approval, we will combine site-visitation data with Personal Information in order to provide the Client with personalized content. If Client declines permission, we will not provide Client the personalized service and will not merge Client Personal Information with site-visitation data.</p>
<p>Disclosure of Personal Information</p>
<p>No attempt is made to identify individual users unless illegal behavior is suspected.</p>
<p>Network traffic is monitored to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage to the SirsiDynix's web services.</p>
<p>Personal Information may be disclosed when required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary when:</p>
<p>It is believed that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating SirsiDynix's Privacy Policy or to protect and defend the rights or property of SirsiDynix and its Web site(s).</p>
<p>To act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of SirsiDynix employees, users of SirsiDynix products or services, or members of the public or when someone may be causing injury to or interfering with SirsiDynix's rights or property, other users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.</p>
<p>To conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on SirsiDynix.</p>
<p>SirsiDynix may occasionally hire or use other parties to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering Client questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Third-party Information</p>
<p>SirsiDynix's Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information SirsiDynix collects from a Client.</p>
<p>Any personally identifiable information disclosed to a third party, such as other users or advertisers, is subject to that party's Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties, such as other users or advertisers, in general or in chat areas or bulletin boards may result in that information being collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others.</p>
<p>SirsiDynix encourages the individual to ask questions and read the third party's Privacy Policy before disclosing personally identifiable information to others.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Cookies are temporary files used to store and sometimes track information about a visit to the site, such as an individual's progress, the number of entries in promotions or contests. Cookies also allow access to certain functions, such as the online catalog and electronic resources. SirsiDynix may use cookies to collect information on which newsletter links are clicked by Clients. This information is used to ensure we are sending information Clients want to read. However, it is collected in aggregate form and never linked with the Clients Personal Information.</p>
<p>Cookies do not store any Personal Information, such as e-mail address or individual passwords.</p>
<p>Cookies cannot:</p>
<p>Read other data off an individual's hard drive.</p>
<p>Pass on a virus.</p>
<p>Read cookies created by other sites.</p>
<p>Temporary cookies files are automatically deleted when you close your browser.</p>
<p>Cookies can be "turned off" or disabled by changing the proper setting in your browser.</p>
<p>Changing the browser setting will disable all cookies delivered to your browser not just the ones delivered by SirsiDynix, however Client will not experience a personalized visit nor will Client be able to subscribe to the service offerings on the site.</p>
<p>iBistro/iLink will not operate properly when cookies have been disabled.</p>
<p>Registration</p>
<p>Registration allows an individual to take advantage of some features of SirsiDynix's software, utilize SirsiDynix services and allows SirsiDynix to communicate with you.</p>
<p>Registration will require you to provide various types of information such as your full name, institution name, address, e-mail address, ZIP code, a user name, and password.</p>
<p>Optional information is marked as such.</p>
<p>Providing additional, optional information helps SirsiDynix make its Web site more valuable to the individual.</p>
<p>Whenever an individual provides SirsiDynix with Personal Information, SirsiDynix will make every effort to provide a link to SirsiDynix's Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Participation in some promotions may not be possible if an individual chooses not to share Personal Information.</p>
<p>SirsiDynix occasionally allows other parties to offer our registered clients information about their products and services. If Client does not want to receive these offers, Client should check the appropriate box.</p>
<p>SirsiDynix may send out periodic e-mails informing the Client of services or security issues related to a product or service the Client requested or licensed. Client will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service the Client selected during registration.</p>

<p>SirsiDynix is not responsible for the accuracy, currency, and content of any other sites to which SirsiDynix provides hyperlinks or access.</p>

<p>SirsiDynix cannot be responsible for an individual's privacy when a patron discloses information to outside web sites.</p>

This Statement describes how SirsiDynix collects and uses certain personally identifiable information that it receives in the United States from the European Union and Switzerland ("EU and Swiss Personal Data"). In particular, SirsiDynix recognizes that the European Union and Switzerland have established strict protections regarding the handling of EU and Swiss Personal Data, and SirsiDynix therefore has elected to adhere to the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and US-Switzerland Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (together, the "Safe Harbors") with respect to such EU and Swiss Personal Data that it receives in the United States. For further background and information about the Safe Harbors, and to see SirsiDynix’s representation on the Safe Harbor List, please refer to the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>
