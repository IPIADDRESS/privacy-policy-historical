<p><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br><br>
We only collect personal information from visitors to our  web site when they voluntarily provide it to us by completing our registration  form or electing to use one of our services. We may require visitors to provide  us with information including, but not limited to, their name, physical  address, email address, birth date, username, password, and on occasion a unique identifier (such as their  mother's maiden name).</p>
<p><strong>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br><br>
When visitors access our web site, certain non-personal  information may be collected from them including, but not limited to, their  browser type (e.g., FireFox or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g.,  Windows or Macintosh), IP address, and the domain name from which they accessed  the site (e.g. google.com). In addition, we may collect information about  visitors' browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit the web site,  the areas or pages of our web site that they visit, the amount of time spent  viewing the site, the number of times the visitor returns to the site, and  click-stream data. We do not track any information about visitors once they  leave our site. We may use cookies (small text files that are stored on  visitors computers when they access our web site) to collect this information.  Information collected through cookies may be combined with visitors' personal  information. We may also allow unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers,  to serve cookies to visitors of our web site. Visitors are always free to  decline cookies, but in doing so they may not be able to use certain features  on our web site. The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers  explains how to configure a browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the  browser inform a user when they receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies  from their hard drives.</p>
<p><strong>IN WHAT WAY DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL AND  NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong><br><br>
Our goal in collecting personal information is to provide  visitors with the most personalized web experience possible and our advertisers  with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little about  our visitors, we are able to deliver more relevant content and advertisements,  and provide better services. We may use information collected from visitors to  our web site for any of the following purposes: (1) to send visitors  information and promotional materials about our company, (2) to send visitors  information and promotional materials from our marketing partners and third parties  (such as advertisers on our web site), (3) to deliver targeted display  advertisements and offers by email (by matching criteria provided by our  advertisers with information collected from our visitors), (4) to contact  visitors to our web site when necessary, (5) to allow one-click purchases or  access to proprietary content by pre-populating fields, within registration or  other transaction screens, with a visitor's name, billing address, and credit  or charge card information (among other things), as provided by that visitor,  (6) to help diagnose problems with our server, (7) to administer our web site,  (8) to conduct internal reviews of our site (e.g., to determine the number of  visitors to the site), (9) to help us better understand visitors' use of our  site, and (10) to protect the security or integrity of our site. Non-personal  information will be used for purposes of conducting internal reviews of the  site, monitoring the site, and providing a greater online experience for our  visitors.</p>
<p><strong>DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong><br><br>
As a rule, we do not share or otherwise distribute our  Subscribers' personal information, including email addresses (i.e. we do not  share, sell, or distribute our email lists to third parties). We may  transfer or disclose information collected from visitors to our web site to our  employees and independent contractors, to our parent company, subsidiaries and  affiliates, and to our consultants, other business associates, and suppliers,  if the disclosure will enable that party to perform a business, professional,  or technical support function for us, or if required to do so by law.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT SECURITY MEASURES DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR  DATA?</strong><br><br>
To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data  integrity, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place  certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure  the information we collect from visitors to our web site. We use SSL (Secure  Socket Layer) technology to protect any credit card information you provide us.  We allow access to personal information only to persons and entities engaging  in activities provided for by this Privacy Policy. Visitors should consider any  communication that they transmit to us (such as data, questions or answers,  comments, suggestions, or communications submitted to a chat room) to be  non-confidential. We will not be liable or responsible if information that  belongs to a visitor is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient.</p>
<p><strong>WE PROTECT CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong><br><br>
Protecting the privacy of children is VERY important to us.  For that reason we do not structure any part of our site to attract anyone  under the age of 18 (21 in some areas) and  we do not allow anyone under the age of 18 (21 in some areas) to register and become a member of our site.</p>
<p><strong>CORPORATE CHANGES</strong><br><br>
In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset or stock sale,  bankruptcy, or other asset transfer (regardless of legal formality), any of our  assets may be transferred to a third party, including personal information  collected from visitors to our web site.</p>
<p><strong>ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVACY TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</strong><br><br>
By visiting this web site, you are agreeing to the  practices described in this Privacy Policy. By visiting this site, you also  accept, without limitation or qualification, all terms and conditions  concerning the use of this site. We may at any time revise these terms and  conditions. You are bound by any such revisions and should therefore  periodically visit this page to review the then-current terms and conditions to  which you are bound. To the extent that any of the third-party sites accessible  through our web site (such as our advertisers) have different privacy practices  from those stated in this Privacy Policy, those third-party privacy practices  govern the collection and use of information you provide when visiting those  sites. We are not responsible for the policies, content, and practices of other  companies.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br><br>
There may be times when we need to change the terms of this  Privacy Policy. To ensure that you are aware of our current privacy practices,  please bookmark this page and check back often.</p>
