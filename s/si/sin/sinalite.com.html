    <p>Sinalite recognizes the importance of maintaining your privacy. We value your   privacy and appreciate your trust in us. This Privacy Policy applies to current   and former visitors to our website and to our online customers. By visiting   and/or using our website at www.Sinalite.com ("Website"), you agree to this   Privacy Policy.This Privacy Policy explains the information practices that apply   to personally identifiable information that we collect about you as an   individual ("Personal Information"), when you visit and/or use our Website, or   when you purchase and/or use our products or services. This Privacy Policy does <strong>not</strong> apply to information about you collected by our affiliates   or third party websites that may post links or advertisements on or otherwise be   accessible from the Website. The information collected by these affiliates or   third party websites is subject to their own privacy policies. </p>
    <p><strong>Information We Collect: </strong>This section of our Privacy Policy   describes the categories of information collected by Sinalite. All such data   that we collect is processed and stored in Markham, Canada except for certain   information that may be stored on servers located outside of Canada for back-up   and recovery purposes. Depending on where you are located, Canada may not have   data protection laws that provide an equivalent level of protection to the laws   in your home country. You have the option not to provide information; however,   withholding information may prevent you from being able to use some of our   Website features.</p>
    <p><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong> Whenever you visit our   Website, we automatically collect some information about your transactions with   us, and your use of our Website. For example, we automatically collect your IP   address, for Sinalite internal use only, such as to help us diagnose problems   with our server and administer our Website. We also automatically track certain   information about your activities on our Website such as the type of web browser   you are using and click stream data. If you are a registered Sinalite customer,   we link this automatically-collected data to the Personal Information we collect   about you described below. We use this linked information to do internal   research on your interests and to help us better understand and serve you.</p>
    <p><strong>Information You Send To Us:</strong> If you choose to provide us with   Personal Information, such as by sending us an e-mail or by filling out a form   with your Personal Information and submitting it to us through our Website, we   collect the Personal Information that you provide to us. For example, if you   register or sign up for an account with us, we collect your name, e-mail   address, and password. If you place an order with us, we collect the Personal   Information that you provide to us such as your shipping, billing, and payment   information.From time-to-time Sinalite may give you the opportunity to   participate in contests or surveys on our Website. If you participate, we will   request certain Personal Information from you. Participation in these surveys or   contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not   to disclose the requested information.<strong> Information </strong></p>
    <p><strong>About Your Transactions With Us:</strong> In addition, we collect   your order information and purchase and payment history. </p>
    <p><strong>Cookies and Similar Files:</strong> Our Website uses "cookies" and   files that are similar to cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers created   by your browser at our request and stored in an approved and standardized place   on your computer. By transferring these cookies, Sinalite assigns you a unique   customer code and record locater. Information about your activity on our Website   can then be included in your customer record, which is stored within the   Sinalite firewall. When you visit or return to our Website, we read the cookie   to identify you as one of our customers and help recall orders or preferences   you have selected. The cookie also enables us to recall your past activities,   post your account data, and tailor site elements and special offers to you. No   Personal Information about you is stored on the cookie.Most Web browsers accept   cookies by default, but allow users to reject cookies by changing the browser   preferences. If you have set up your browser to reject cookies, some aspects of   our Website, including our Shopping Cart, will not work properly.If you have   Macromedia Flash installed on your computer, we will also use a file called a   Flash Object to store your unique customer code and record locater on your   computer. Unless deactivated by you, the Flash Object provides us with a backup   method for recognizing you in the event that we are unable to identify your   cookies.This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies and similar files by   Sinalite only and does not cover the use of cookies and similar files by any   third party advertisers or websites linked to the Website.We use third-party   advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may use a   cookie or an action tag, also known as a Web Beacon or a 1 pixel .gif file, to   track your response to their advertisement and to measure the effectiveness of   their advertising or to award incentives or points to their members who respond   to their advertisements. Sinalite has no access to or control over cookies or   action tags used by these third party companies. Sinalite does not receive any   personally identifiable information collected by these advertisers using action   tags or cookies nor does Sinalite disclose any of your Personal Information such   as your name, telephone number or address with these companies except in   accordance with this Sinalite Privacy Policy. Members of the Network Advertising   Initiative (NAI) permit you to limit targeted advertising from them by using an   opt-out tool available on the NAI website at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp' \o 'blocked::http://" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a></p>
    <p><strong>Use and Disclosure of Information:</strong> We use the information   that we collect about you to maintain, improve, and administer our Website,   operate our business, provide products and services that you request, administer   your account, inform you about products and services that might be of interest   to you, and personalize your online experience.In order to carry out certain   business functions, such as order fulfillment, e-mail delivery, or marketing, we   sometimes hire other companies to perform services on our behalf. We may   disclose Personal Information that we collect about you to these companies to   enable them to perform these services, but they are required to safeguard the   Personal Information and are not authorized to use it for any other purpose than   completing their contractual requirements to Sinalite. For example, as a part of   the normal process of completing your purchase, Sinalite may provide your   Personal Information to a third party payment processor, such as Monaris,   paypal, authorized.net depending on your chosen method of payment. Please be   aware that, because of the limitations of the systems used by some financial   institutions, the statement you receive from your credit card or financial   institution may show the name of a third party payment processor, such as   Monaris, paypal, or authorized.net instead of or in addition to the Sinalite   name. In addition, we may share the Personal Information we collect with other   companies with whom we have joint marketing arrangements. If you do not wish to   have your Personal Information shared with these organizations, simply email us   at <a href="mailto:support@Sinalite.com">support@Sinalite.com</a> to remove you   from the list. We may also disclose information, including Personal Information,   we collect about you in other circumstances as required or permitted by law. For   example, Sinalite reserves the right to disclose Personal Information, including   account information, when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to cooperate   with an investigation of activities claimed to be unlawful, to enforce our   terms, or to protect the rights or property of Sinalite or others. In addition,   it is possible that in the future another company may acquire Sinalite or its   assets. It is also possible that Sinalite may partner with or purchase another   company to continue to do business as a combined entity. In the event that this   occurs, it is possible that our customer information, including your Personal   Information, may be transferred to the new business entity as one of Sinalite's   assets. In such an event, we will update this policy to reflect any change in   ownership or control of your Personal Information. </p>
    <p><strong>Links To Third Party Products and Services:</strong> While you are   visiting or using the Website, you may be presented with an opportunity to   purchase third party products or services. These products and services are   offered and supplied by independent companies not owned or operated by Sinalite.   If you click on one of the presented offers, you will be redirected to the site   of the third party, and any information you provide in response to the offer   will be collected and used by the third party and not by Sinalite. Information   you provide to the third party and any dealings you have with the third party   will be governed by the privacy and other policies of that third party. </p>
    <p><strong>Your Choices:</strong> We offer you a variety of choices with respect   to how we use and share your Personal Information. </p>
    <p><strong>Sharing Information With Others.</strong> We will not share your   Personal Information, such as your e-mail address or name, with unaffiliated   organizations for them to use to inform you about their or other companies'   products and services unless you consent to this sharing on registration or in   updating your account preferences. You may opt in by checking the appropriate   box during registration or, following registration, by logging into "My   Account," selecting "Account Update," and checking the applicable box. You may   also opt-in by sending a written request to the address below. If you send a   written request, please be sure to include your exact name, mailing address and   telephone number(s) and a statement that you would like us to share your   Personal Information with other organizations that may have special offers,   products or services that may be of interest to you. Even if you do not opt in   to this sharing, we may still share Personal Information about you with other   companies as permitted or required by law. </p>
    <p><strong>Communications from Sinalite.</strong> If you do not want to receive   e-mails from Sinalite about products and services that may be of interest to   you, simply request to be added to our Do-Not-E-Mail list, Do-Not-Call list,   and/or our Do-Not-Mail list by writing to the address below and indicating your   preferences.
