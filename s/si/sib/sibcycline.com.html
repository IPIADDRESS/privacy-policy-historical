            Information Sibcy Cline Gathers and Tracks
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                SIBCY CLINE gathers information about customers in two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Registration: Information that users provide through optional and voluntary submissions.
                    These are voluntary submissions to receive our Home Watch Service, to email a friend,
                    and for scheduling appointments. Customers also provide information on our site
                    to contact an agent to get further information on listings.</li>
                <li>Usage tracking: Information SIBCY CLINE gathers through aggregated tracking information
                    derived mainly by tallying page views (using IP address log analyses and through
                    the use of Cookies) throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor
                    our content to customers' needs and to help us better understand the demographics
                    of our audience. Under no circumstances does SIBCY CLINE divulge any information
                    about an individual user to a third party.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="subHeader">
                Usage tracking</p>
            <p>
                SIBCY CLINE tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we
                do not correlate this information with data about individual users. SIBCY CLINE
                does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's browser type, and
                MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained
                in every user's browser).</p>
            <p>
                SIBCY CLINE sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our
                Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We
                use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't
                like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read,
                but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build
                a better service for you.</p>
            <p class="subHeader">
                Cookies
            </p>
            <p>
                We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer.
                The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable
                us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and
                knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information
                you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie
                files created by other sites. SIBCY CLINE uses cookies to track user traffic patterns
                (as described above).</p>
            <p>
                You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser
                to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with
                each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However,
                you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling,
                surveys, user session customization and membership services. Some of the features
                of the site may have limited or missing, or broken functionality if you choose not
                to accept cookies.

                "E-mail this to a friend" policy</p>
            <p>
                Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to
                someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their
                email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in
                the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent
                the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>

                SIBCY CLINE uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their
                experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized
                elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests
                of our users.</p>
            <p>
                As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send
                out Home Watch Alerts and to help our customers with the home buying and selling
                process.</p>
            <p>
                We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and
                don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users
                read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to
                build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function
                as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms
                a particular user enters.</p>
            <p>
                SIBCY CLINE creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns
                for Sibcy Cline and its affiliate companies. We will not disclose any information

                Sharing of the information</p>
            <p>
                As a general rule, SIBCY CLINE REALTORS will not disclose any of your personal Information
                except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when
                we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described
                below. The following describes some of the ways that your Information may be disclosed.</p>
            <p>
                <u>SIBCY CLINE REALTORS Real Estate Brokers</u>: SIBCY CLINE REALTORS may disclose
                information about you to SIBCY CLINE’s brokers and Realtors who would like to contact
                you for general marketing purposes.</p>
            <p>
                <u>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</u>: SIBCY CLINE REALTORS may disclose some or all
                your Information to business partners or sponsors, but this use will be specifically
                described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Many
                promotions offer opportunities to request additional Information from sponsors.
                By requesting more information, you give SIBCY CLINE REALTORS permission to transfer
                your information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances,
                only your e-mail address will be shared. If more Information will be shared with
                the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.</p>
            <p>
                <u>Third Party Data and Data in the Aggregate</u>: From time to time, you may be
                offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties.
                If you opt to receive information from these third parties, SIBCY CLINE REALTORS
                will (with your permission) share your name and email address with such third parties.
                Under confidentiality agreements, SIBCY CLINE REALTORS may match Customer Information
                with third party data. Also, SIBCY CLINE REALTORS discloses aggregated Customer
                statistics (for example, 50% of our Customers are male) in order to describe our
                services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for
                other lawful purposes.</p>
            <p>
                SIBCY CLINE uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your
                needs and help us better understand our audience's demographics. We will not share
                information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable
                law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the
