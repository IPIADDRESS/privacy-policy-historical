Through Time Inc. publications, websites, and other media, you can
order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an
opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online
newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities.
You are able to visit much of this website and enjoy many Time Inc.
publications and promotions without providing any personally
identifiable information. Sometimes, however, we do need your
personally identifiable information to provide you with the products
and services that you request. The types of personally identifiable
information that may be collected at these pages and elsewhere include,
but are not limited to: name, address, e-mail address, telephone
number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your
interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. </font><p><font face="helvetica,arial" size="2">At some Time Inc.
sites and through certain promotions, you can submit information about
other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail
address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift
online or offline and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might
submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally
identifiable information that may be collected about other people at
these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and
telephone number. </font></p><p><font face="helvetica,arial" size="2">For certain
promotions, only persons who provide us with the requested personally
identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and
services or otherwise participate in the promotion's activities and
offerings. </font></p><p><font face="helvetica,arial" size="2">
We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our web pages or use our applications, such as the type of browser and operating system you are using, your IP Address, and your Internet service provider, and location-based information.

requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your
inquiries about offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or
services that we believe may be of interest to you. </font>
<p><font face="helvetica,arial" size="2">We sometimes use this
information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you
have won one of our contests or when we make changes to subscriber
agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to
contact you about your account with us. </font></p>
<p><font face="helvetica,arial" size="2">We use the

submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"), we
may publish your name, screen name, and other information you have
provided to us. </font></p>

we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used

<p><font face="helvetica,arial" size="2">We sometimes use
the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve
the design and content of our publications and websites and to enable
us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this
information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer
you products, programs, or services. </font></p>
<p><font face="helvetica,arial" size="2">We will disclose
information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in
response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such
information in response to a law enforcement agency's request. </font></p>
<p><font face="helvetica,arial" size="2">Agents and
contractors of Time Inc. who have access to personally identifiable
information are required to protect this information in a manner that

<p><font face="helvetica,arial" size="2">We may transfer
your personally identifiable information to other Time Inc. offices for
internal management and administrative purposes. Your personal data
will be transferred to other Time Inc. offices where necessary for the

your benefit. Transfers of personally identifiable information may also
be made where necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of
legal claims.</font></p>
<p><font face="helvetica,arial" size="2">Although we take
appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of
information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable
information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is
inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Inadvertent disclosures may
result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities
in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information
about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in
the data.

<b>Additional Information Regarding Children's Privacy</b><br>
Your child's privacy is important to us, and we are committed to safeguarding children's personal information collected online, and to
helping parents and their children learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet.  Therefore, we have
taken additional measures to tailor our content and offerings at those sites and portions of our sites directed to children to help them
protect their privacy while online.  These measures include asking children to use non-personally identifiable screen names rather than
their real names in certain activities and making efforts to prevent children from posting contact information. In addition, we do not ask
children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in an activity.<br><br>

Visitors to the portions of our sites directed at children may participate in many of our offerings and activities without providing
any personally identifiable information.  To participate in certain of our interactive features, however, we may ask the user to provide us
with the following types of information: first name, first initial of the last name, the visitor's e-mail address, parent's e-mail address,
and age information.  On some pages of our sites, such as where children can send postcards to their friends, we also may ask your
child to provide information (e.g., friend's first name and e-mail address).<br><br>

We use this information only for our internal purposes to enable them to enter one of our sweepstakes or contests, to express their opinions
on various topics, to send electronic postcards to their friends, to otherwise participate in one of the activities on our site, or to
respond to an e-mail message they have sent to us.  We use information about others to enable the child to communicate with them or, in the
case of the parent's e-mail address, to obtain your consent for participation in our activities (e.g., participation in a contest or
subscription to SI Kids Magazine).  We may also use information to enable parents and children to learn of additional product or service
opportunities.  We do not share children's personally identifiable information with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy
Policy.

Parents, if you would like to do any of the following, please send an e-mail to 
<a href="mailto:consumeraffairs@customersvc.com">customer service</a> for instructions:<br>
• access the personally identifiable information that this site has collected from your child,<br>
• correct factual errors in such information,<br>
• request to have this information deleted, or<br>
• request that we no longer collect or maintain such information.<br><br>

To protect your child's privacy and security online, we will take appropriate steps to help verify your identity before granting you
access to the personal information that we collect and maintain about your child.
