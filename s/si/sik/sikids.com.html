<h2>Time Warner Children’s Privacy Notice</h2></dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>

<p>Your child’s privacy is important to us at Time Warner.  We are committed to safeguarding children’s personal information collected online, and to helping parents and their children learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet.  The additional measures we have taken to tailor our content and offerings at our children’s sites to help children protect their privacy while online include encouraging children to use non-personally identifiable screen names rather than their real names and taking efforts to prevent children from posting contact information.  In addition, we do not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in an activity.  </p>

<p>To help ensure a rewarding online experience for your child, we provide you with this summary of our information practices to empower you in connection with your child’s online experiences.  This privacy notice governs the collection and use of information at sikids.com, one of Time Warner’s Web sites directed to children.</p>

<b><p>I.  <u>The Information We Collect </u></p><u>
</u></b><i>
</i><p>To enable children to participate in some of our online activities, we may ask them to provide personal information including name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, and date of birth.  </p>

<p>On some pages of our site, such as where children can send electronic postcards to their friends, we also may ask your child to provide personal information about other people.  This is usually limited to a first name and e-mail address.  We also may ask for the name and e-mail address of the child’s parent. </p>
<b>
</b><p>When children visit our site, we automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system (<i>e.g.</i>, Windows ’95 or Mac OS) and browser (<i>e.g., </i>Netscape, Internet Explorer) being used, and the domain name of the Internet service provider (<i>e.g., </i>America Online, Earthlink).</p>

<b><p>II.  <u>How We Use the Information</u></p><u>
</u></b>
<b><p>We never share children’s personal information with third parties.  </p>

</b><p>We use children’s information only for our internal purposes to enable them to enter one of our sweepstakes or contests, to express their opinions on various topics, to send electronic postcards to their friends, and to respond to an e-mail message they have sent us.</p>

<p>We also may use children’s information to offer children or parents products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to them.  </p>

<p>We use the information that we collect about others to either enable the child to communicate with them, for example, to send an electronic greeting card to a friend, or to obtain your consent for participation in these activities, such as to notify you when your child has entered one of our contests. Or would like to subscribe to SI For Kids magazine.</p>

<p>We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.  We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.  </p>

<p>We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.  We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request.</p>

<p>This Time Warner site will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways that are materially different from the ones described above without also providing parental notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different uses.  </p>

<b><p>III.  <u>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors  </u></p><u>
</u></b>
<p>Our site contains links to other sites whose information practices may be different from ours.  Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as the sites are not covered by our privacy policy.  </p>

<p>This Time Warner site sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties.  By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that children voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion.  Time Warner does not control the third-party sponsors' use of this information.  <a href="thirdparty.html">Click here</a> for a list of names and contact information of outside third parties that may collect and maintain personally identifiable information as a result of their participation in these activities.  </p>

</u></b><i>
