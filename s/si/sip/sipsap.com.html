                  We at sipsap, ("we" or " SipSap.com") 
                  have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment 
                  to protecting your personal information and informing you about 
                  how we handle it. This privacy policy only applies to transactions 
                  and activities in which you engage, and data gathered, on the 
                  SipSap.com Website, SipSap.com email communications 
                  between SipSap.com members (collectively, the "Site") 
                  but does not apply to any other Website or offline point of 
                  contact between SipSap.com, or any other company, and 
                  consumers. Please review this privacy policy periodically as 
                  we may modify it from time to time. This privacy policy was 
                  last revised on June 21, 2003. Each time you visit the Site 
                  or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting 
                  the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.

                    Your IP Address</p>
                  <p>Like most e-commerce Websites, each time you visit the Site, 
                    we automatically collect your IP address and the web page 
                    from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the 
                    Site for you and to diagnose problems with our Site, we use 
                    your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic 
                    information about you. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p><br>
                    Cookies</p>
                  <p>Like most Websites, the Site uses cookies to keep track of 
                    your purchases and other activity on the Site and enhance 
                    your experience on the Site. We also use cookies to deliver 
                    content specific to your interests, to save your password, 
                    and if you choose, to save other personal and financial information 
                    so you do not have to reenter it each time you visit the Site. 
                    If you wish to disable these cookies, the "help" 
                    portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. 
                    However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may 
                    not be able to access certain areas on the Site. </p>

                  <p><br>
                    Information We Collect From You</p>
                  <p>In order to operate the Site and to provide you with information 
                    about products or services that may be of interest to you, 
                    we may collect "personal information" (i.e. information 
                    that could be used to contact you directly (without using 
                    the Site) such as full name, postal address, phone number 
                    or email address), "financial information" (i.e. 
                    credit card numbers or passwords) or "demographic information" 
                    (i.e. information that you submit, or that we collect, that 
                    is neither personal information nor financial information; 
                    this may include, but is not limited to, zip code, postal 
                    code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, purchase 
                    history information, browsing history information, searching 
                    history information, registration history information, and 
                    the content of communications between you and other members 
                    over the Site), subject to the rest of this paragraph. Demographic 
                    information is divided into two categories: 1) "non-public 
                    information", which consists of purchase history information 
                    and one-on-one communications between you and other users 
                    of the Site; and 2) "public information", which 
                    consists of all other demographic information. We ask that 
                    you do not enter personal information or financial information 
                    into your "Profile" (for example, don't use your 
                    address or passcode as your username, or include your name 
                    or address in your written responses), because if you do then 
                    it may be posted publicly on the Site, and the information 
                    will then be treated as "demographic information" 
                    that is "public information." </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p><br>
                    Information Other Websites Collect From You </p>
                  <p>On the Site, we place links to other Websites operated by 
                    other parties. Some of these other Websites contain our brand 
                    names and trademarks and other intellectual property that 
                    we own; others do not. When you click on these links and visit 
                    these other Websites, regardless of whether or not they contain 
                    our brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property, 
                    you need to be aware that we do not control these other Websites 
                    or these other Websites' business practices, and that this 
                    privacy policy does not apply to these other Websites. Consequently, 
                    the operators of these other Websites may collect different 
                    kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that 
                    information in different ways than we would if it were collected 
                    on the Site. We encourage you to review their privacy policies 
                    and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.

                    or important news that could affect your relationship with 
                    SipSap.com), and to forward messages to you from other 
                    SipSap.com users. These types of communications, are 
                    known as "Operational Communications." In some cases, 
                    Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages, 
                    such as banner ads and special offers. </p>

                    with options to decline to receive communications from SipSap.com 
                    (other than those contained in Operational Communications). 
                    Some of these options may only be for a certain category of 
                    communications; others may be more general. By posting a profile
