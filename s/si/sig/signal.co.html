<p>Signal Digital, Inc. (dba Signal) and its subsidiary companies (collectively, “<b>Signal</b>”) provides this Website Privacy Policy to share with you how we treat personal information about you that we collect and receive in connection with Signal Websites, features, or applications owned or controlled by Signal that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, our “<b>Website</b>”). Signal also works with clients who license and use our technology and services. This Website Privacy Policy describes Signal’s privacy practices with regard to information collected through the Website. If you are a consumer and would like to understand our privacy practices in connection with the Signal services used by our clients, please review <a href="http://www.signal.co/privacy-policy-platform-privacy-policy/">Signal’s Platform Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>In general, you can visit our Website without providing us with any “<b>Personal Information</b>” (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as your name, mailing address, email address, or phone number). However, you may choose to submit Personal Information through our Website, and we may request other information about you, such as demographic information (e.g., your age, gender, ZIP code or similar information), payment information, information about your employer, and your preferences or interests. If we combine these types of other information about you with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Website Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should know that we also may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through our Website, we will treat the combined information as described in this Website Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Our Website is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we learn that we have in fact collected Personal Information from a user under 13, we will delete it.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Information about your visit to our Website</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>As described below, we and our third party service providers may use certain technologies (such as cookies and Web beacons) that automatically or passively collect certain information regarding your use of our Website (“<b>Usage Information</b>”). Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Website, any search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to our Website, the areas within our Website that you visited, and the time of day you visited our Website, among other information. Usage Information also includes the IP address or other unique identifier (“<b>Device Identifier</b>”) for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access our Website. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your device, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us with information regarding the physical location of the device you used to access our Website. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>We and our third party service providers, including third party advertisers and analytics providers, may use the following or similar technologies to collect Usage Information whenever you visit our Website:</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A “cookie” is a small data file that is transferred to and stored on your computer’s hard disk or similar device when you retrieve content from a Web server. Cookies may be stored on your device for different periods of time depending on how they are used. “Session cookies” store information that is only relevant for your current activity and are no longer accessible after you shut down your browser. “Persistent cookies” remain after you close your browser and may be accessed by your browser on subsequent visits. When you visit our Website, both session and persistent cookies may be transferred to your device. Certain Web browsers and certain browser add-ons such as Adobe Flash may provide additional data storage mechanisms that are used in a manner similar to cookies, and some of the content included on our Website may make use of this type of storage. For example, a Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device. For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for a variety of purposes, e.g., to identify your device when you revisit our Website, to recall your authentication information, or to store information related to your navigation throughout our Website, or to enable certain features on our Website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refuse to accept cookies, or remove cookies, by editing the privacy and security settings of your Web browser. For specific instructions on how to change privacy and security settings, consult the “Help” menu within your Web browser software. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Adobe Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the Website of its manufacturer.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>You do not have to accept all cookies sent to you by our Website; however, depending on the particular cookie you reject, you may not be able to use some of the features of our Website.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Web beacons</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>We may also employ software technology known as “Web beacons” or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of what content on our Website is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users. Web beacons are embedded in the Web pages you review or email messages you receive. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Website, to monitor how users navigate the Website, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>We may use information collected through our Website, including your Personal Information and Usage Information, to (a) enable you to use our Website, and to provide related user service, including responding to your questions, complaints, or comments; (b) fulfill transactions and process orders and payments; (c) administer and develop our business relationship with you and the company you represent; (d) provide you with information, products or services that you have requested or agreed to receive or that we otherwise believe will interest you, including information and special offers from us and our third party business partners; (e) tailor content, recommendations and offers we display to you, both on the Website and elsewhere online, (f) conduct internal analyses, such as surveys and market research, to improve our Website, our products and services, and for other internal business purposes; (g) process information you provide via our Website, including verifying that your e-mail address is active and valid; (h) contact you with administrative communications and, in our discretion, changes to this Website Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use, or any of our other policies, (i) assess your employment application for a position with Signal or an entity related to Signal and prepare related governmental and internal statistics reports, and (j) for purposes as disclosed at the time you provide your information, with your consent, and as further described in this Website Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Analytics Providers, Ad Servers, and Similar Third Parties</h2>

Some of these third parties may collect personal information from you over time when you visit the Website or other websites and services. &nbsp;Cookies and Web beacons, including those set by third party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share Usage Information about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for similar purposes. We may share Usage Information about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for similar purposes.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>We use a variety of service providers to perform advertising services. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You may want to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. You may also want to visit or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an “opt-out” by participating companies in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program. Please note opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while online.</p>
