<h2><a name="ourservices"></a>Our Services</h2>
<p>Signal is a service provider. We license proprietary technology and provide data solutions to our clients (the technology and services together, the “<strong>Services</strong>”).</p>
<p>Our services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration of tracking tags and other code into client websites, mobile applications and other devices that allows clients and their various third-party marketing and technology partners to collect data relating to user interactions and interests;</li>
<li>Collection and distribution of data for the purposes of measuring the effectiveness of websites, mobile applications, advertising campaigns and interactions with other marketing channels;</li>
<li>Management and storage of de-identified data that allows our clients to recognize their customers across devices and platforms, to better understand their customers and to engage their customers with more targeted marketing messages.</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><a name="datasignalcollects"></a>Data Signal Collects or Receives and Stores in Connection with the Services</h2>
<p>Signal does not have any relationship, contractual or otherwise, with visitors to its clients’ Data Sources. In order to provide the Services to our clients, we collect data from our clients’ websites, mobile applications, advertising impressions, email campaigns, retail stores and other sources (collectively “<strong>Data Sources</strong>”).</p>
<p>The information we collect or that clients provide us about their customers we call “<strong>Client Data</strong>“. “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means information that identifies the user of a Data Source as a specific individual, such as the user’s name, mailing address, email address, or phone number or other information that identifies you as an actual person.</p>
<p>Client Data collected or provided in connection with certain Services (such as analytics), may include Personal Information but we do not use Personal Information in connection with any Services that assist clients with their interest-based advertising. Note that in providing the Services, we do not collect any Personal Information on our own behalf – we collect information on behalf of our clients as service provider to those clients. We only store, use and share Personal Information collected through our Services as directed by our clients on their behalf.</p>
<p>We do not use Personal Information in connection with advertising-related Services. For advertising related Services, we do use and store data that has been de-identified, which is typically accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code that we cannot use to identify you directly. We combine this information with other de-identified information collected from or provided by other client Data Sources in order to help our clients recognize their customers and infer customer interests and preferences.</p>
<p>In order to provide the Services to our clients, we automatically collect certain information about your use of our client’s Data Sources when you visit or interact with those Data Sources (“<strong>Usage Data</strong>”). We collect a variety of Usage Data including, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address and other unique identifier for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the client’s Data Sources (“<strong>device identifier</strong>”);</li>
<li>Information about a visitor’s Web browser and device;</li>
<li>Information about visitor interactions with the client’s Data Source, such as content viewed and products purchased;</li>
<li>Information regarding a user’s preferences and interests;</li>
<li>Demographic data, such as age and gender; and</li>
<li>Location information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We consider the following “Sensitive Data,” and we do not use this Sensitive Data in connection with interest-based advertising Services:</p>
<ul>
<li>racial or ethnic origin;</li>
<li>sexual preferences or practices;</li>
<li>criminal record;</li>
<li>health information;</li>
<li>genetic information that is not otherwise health information; or</li>
<li>biometric information or templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>We further limit the collection and use of sensitive data as defined and required by applicable law in certain jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions define sensitive data to further include:</p>
<ul>
<li>political opinions;</li>
<li>membership of a political association;</li>
<li>religious beliefs or affiliations;</li>
<li>philosophical beliefs;</li>
<li>membership of a professional or trade association;</li>
<li>membership of a trade union.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also supplement Client Data with outside records from third parties, and we treat the combined data as described in this Services Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><a name="technologiesused"></a>Technologies Used to Collect Usage Data.</h2>
<p>We use many technologies to collect Usage Data. Some examples include:</p>
<p><strong><a name="cookieslocalstorage"></a>Cookies and Local Storage.</strong> Cookies and local storage are data files placed within a browser on a device when it is used to visit a Data Source.
