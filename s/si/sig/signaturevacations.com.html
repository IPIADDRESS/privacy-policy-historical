    to your inquiries and complaints regarding the protection and privacy of your 
    personal information, and deal with requests for access to your information.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    SIGNATURE VACATIONS and our affiliates may share with each other marketing 
    lists (lists of customers that meet certain general non-sensitive criteria). 
    This information may include your name, address, gender, preferred language 
    of communication, preferences, needs, interests and information about trips 
    you have booked with SIGNATURE VACATIONS and its affiliates in the past. The 
    sharing of such information is to assist our affiliates to offer products 
    and services that are most likely to be of interest to you.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Will SIGNATURE VACATIONS ever disclose my information to third parties?</strong><br>
    <br>
    We disclose your information to third parties for the purpose of completing 
    your transaction with us, providing services to you and for the purposes of 
    associated administration and obtaining professional advice.<br>

    insurer under that policy, SIGNATURE VACATIONS may provide information to 
    the insurer, if requested, with respect to cancellation charges applicable 
    to the particular product, or the date the trip was cancelled by you, or the 
    date any other relevant event giving rise to coverage under the policy occurred.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What other information is collected?</strong><br>

    note that any contact with SIGNATURE VACATIONS, either online or by telephone, 
    may be recorded for training and monitoring purposes.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Where is my personal information stored?</strong><br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What is a 'cookie'?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Cookies are small files that are sent to your browser (for example Internet 
    Explorer or Netscape) and stored on your computer's hard disk. They only identify 
    your computer and not you personally. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>How does SIGNATURE VACATIONS use cookies?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Cookies help speed up the booking process so that you do not need to re-type 
    the same information again and again. We use cookies to measure site usage 
    such as entry and exit points of visitors, how many people visit a certain 
    section or page and details of searches performed and related information. 
    If you are making a purchase we will also use cookies to keep track of the 
    transaction from one page to the next. If you choose to, we will store your 
    email address and password in the cookie, in a secure form, to allow you to 
    login automatically. Other than this, we do not store any other information 
    in the cookie, or use it for any other purpose.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What if I sign-up as a My Signature member or subscribe to a newsletter?</strong></p>
   <p>When you sign up as a My Signature member or newsletter subscriber, you 
    will receive occasional communication by email such as a Welcome message, 
    Newsletter Subscribe or Unsubscribe Confirmation, E-newsletters, Password 
    Reminder if requested, Trip Reminders, or a reminder if you account is inactive 
    for a period of time. These emails may contain your name, your user name, 
    your password or your travel itinerary if you booked through this Web site.<br>
   </p>
   <p><strong>How will I know if my online booking is confirmed?<br>
    <br>
    </strong>Each time you purchase travel through signaturevacations.com you 
    will receive confirmation of your travel itinerary by e-mail. In the event 
    that your travel plans are disrupted because of mechanical, weather, or carrier 
    business conditions, SIGNATURE VACATIONS may contact you to inform you of 
    these disruptions and help you make alternative arrangements.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Where are the credit/debit card numbers stored?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Your credit/debit card number is not stored on any file within the SIGNATURE 
    VACATIONS Web site and is only used to complete the transaction. The credit/debit 
    number is passed through to our credit/debit card company for validation and 
    debit via our booking system. Once you enter your credit/debit number it is 
    encrypted so that nobody else can read it, and is not printed out or displayed 
    on any other computer.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>How will I know if you change this privacy policy?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Any changes to the Privacy Policy will be made to this page. Your continued 
    use of this site will constitute your agreement to the changed Terms and Conditions 
    of using this site.<br>
