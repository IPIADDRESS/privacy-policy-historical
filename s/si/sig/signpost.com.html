        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        October 4, 2010

        <p>
          Your privacy is important to Signpost. We are committed to respecting your privacy and the confidentiality of
          your personal data. This Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how Signpost uses and
          safeguards the information you provide. By using the Signpost website, mobile websites, and mobile phone
          applications ("the Service"), you consent to the policies and practices described in this Policy. Please read
          this page carefully to learn about how we treat information.
        </p>

        <h2>General</h2>

        <p>
          Please remember that when you create a post using Signpost's Service, we record, store and publish the post
          and
          make it available to the public domain, and such information may be accessed by others over whom Signpost has
          no
          control. Your data will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the United States. If you access
          Signpost
          outside the United States, your usage of the Service constitutes consent to the transfer of your data out of
          your country and to the United States.
        </p>

        <h2>Collection and Retention of Information</h2>

        <p>

          To use some features the Service requires that you provide personal information, including your name, e-mail
          address, and any other information from which your identity is discernible. This information, are retained in
          order to enable a personalized experience, such as saving your user setting preferences like favorites, prior
          created list, notification preferences, process your inquiries, conduct your forward requests and/or otherwise
          improve the Service. Your personal information is not shared with the rest of the Signpost community, except
          for
          the information you choose to voluntarily provide to the public in the form of posts. We will not sell or
          share
          the personal information we collect with third parties, unless presented with a valid and binding court order
          or
          subpoena.
        </p>

        <p>
          Signpost collects or may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP code, age,
          preferences, gender, interests and favorites. Although we don't currently work with advertisers, if we did in
          the future, we would only provide them with aggregated information such as the number of times a particular
          post
          was viewed, or the number of users who searched for a particular term, or the top ranked post in order to
          display relevant advertising. Such information does not identify you individually.
        </p>

        <p>
          We collect feedback from users of the Service. In connection with such feedback, we collect names and email
          addresses. We may use this information to contact you regarding your feedback. We will not provide the names,
          email addresses, or feedback to any other party.
        </p>

        <p>

          Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in feedback is used for the purposes of reviewing this
          feedback and improving the Service. Signpost reserves the right to utilize anonymous information for marketing
          purposes, for instance by displaying selected posts on the website or in other communications. Further,
          Signpost
          may from time to time ask you to provide information on your experiences which will be used to measure and
          improve quality. You are at no time in any obligation to provide any of such data.
        </p>

        <p>
          A cookie is a small text file created by our website and stored on your computer that assists Signpost in
          providing customized services. The use of cookies is standard in the industry and used at most websites. We
          use
          cookies for login verification, session management, load balancing and personalization to enhance your user
          experience. We never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer. You are always free to decline
          our
          cookies if your browser permits, although in that case, you may not be able to use certain features on the

        </p>

        <h2>Information Security</h2>

        <p>
          We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
          disclosure or destruction of data. These include storage and processing practices and security measures, as
          well
          as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We
          restrict access to personal information to Signpost personnel, contractors and agents who need to know that
          information in order to operate, develop or improve the Service. These individuals are bound by
          confidentiality
          obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to
          meet these obligations.
        </p>

        <h2>Choices for Personal Information</h2>

        <p>
          You can decline to submit personal information to the Service, in which case Signpost may not be able to
          provide
          certain parts of the Service to you.
        </p>

        <h2>Children</h2>

        <p>

          Signpost is not intended for children under 13 years of age. Signpost does not knowingly collect personal
          information from children under 13. Signpost believes that a child should get a parent's consent before using
          the Signpost services.
        </p>

          page.
