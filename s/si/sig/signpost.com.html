          <p> We collect "Non-Personal Information" and "Personal Information."  Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you,
              such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences
              that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks.  Personal Information includes information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a
              name and/or your business' name, address, telephone number, email address, payment information and other information which you submit to us at the Site.
              Sharing Personal Information with us is entirely optional.

          <p class="mb_20"> In an effort to improve the quality of the Site and the Services, we track information provided to us by your browser when you view the Site or
              use the Services, such as your Internet service provider, the website you came from (known as the "referring URL"), the type of browser you use, your
              operating system, the device from which you connected to the Services, the time and date of access, the Site pages viewed, time spent at our Site, the
              sites visited just before and just after our Site, and other information that does not personally identify you.  We track this information using cookies,
              or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier.  Cookies are a feature of web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.) software that allows
              web servers to recognize the computer used to access a site.  They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on one site to simplify
              subsequent interactions with that site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transaction on related web pages. This makes it easier
              for a user to move from site to site and to complete transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.
          </p>

          <p> Cookies are sent to a user's browser from our servers and are stored on the user's computer hard drive.  Sending a cookie to a user's browser enables us
              to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user's preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual
              and aggregate basis.  For example, Signpost may use cookies to collect the following information:
          </p>

          <ul class="dot light mt_20 mb_30">
              <li>Website visits</li>

              <li>E-mail address</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mb_20"> Signpost may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them,
              while session cookies expire when you close your browser.
          </p>
          <p> If you do not wish to transmit cookie information about yourself, you may turn off the cookie function in your web browser; please consult
              the "Help" section of your web browser to correctly do so.  If you elect to turn off cookies, however, you may not be able to access certain features of
              the Site and your use of some portions of the Site may be affected.

          <p class="dark_gray mt_20"><strong class="regular">Web beacons</strong></p>
          <p> Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics
              to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge
