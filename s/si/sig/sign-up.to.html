      <h1>Privacy and Sign-Up.to </h1> 
      <p>We take the privacy of client and end user data very seriously. The
        entire Sign-Up.to system is designed to provide all parties with complete
        control over their data.</p>
      <p>We believe that your personal data is your own, and you should control
        it. Because of this Sign-Up.to do not rent, sell or otherwise disclose
        data to 3rd parties unless we are required to by law. </p>
      <p>As a subscriber to a company who uses Sign-Up.to you have complete access
        to data stored on you - simply log in at <a href="http://subscriber.sign-up.to">http://subscriber.sign-up.to</a>        and
        you can view, edit and delete your data completely free of charge.</p>
      <p>That's the short version. Because our lawyers like to earn their fees,
        they insisted that we also have the long version below...</p>
      <h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
      <p> Sign-Up Technologies Limited (referred to in this Privacy Policy as "SuTL", "we", "us" or "our")
        is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
        how we use the information we collect about you through Sign-UpT, how
        you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information
        and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy. This
        Privacy Policy forms part of the <a href="http://www.sign-up.to/html/consumer/terms.shtml">Terms
        of Use </a></p>
      <p><strong>1. Contact details </strong></p>
      <p>The Sign-Up website (the "Site") and the Sign-Up data processing services
        (together, the "Services") are provided by Sign-Up Technologies Limited,
        a company registered in England and Wales with company registration number
        04674316. </p>

      </p>
      <p><strong>2. Introduction </strong></p>
      <p>2.1 We are registered under, and process personal data in accordance
        with, the United Kingdom's data protection laws. <br>
  2.2 This Privacy Policy covers the provision of the Services only and not any
  other companies' websites which you may access from the Site or by using the
  Services. <br>
  2.3 If we change the Privacy Policy we will place notices on the Site and post
  the changes on this page. If you do not accept any changes to the Privacy Policy
  please stop using the Services and close your membership account. </p>
      <p><strong>3. Personal Information Collected </strong></p>
      <p>3.1 We will only collect personal information about you that you have
        given, either: <br>
  (a) when you register for the Services; or <br>
  (b) if you have previously registered your details with a company which has
  since joined the Sign-Up Services. <br>
  3.2 When you register to use the Services you will be asked to provide personal
  information such as your name, postal and e-mail addresses, contact telephone
  numbers, date of birth, gender and other lifestyle information. </p>
      <p><strong>4. Use of personal Information </strong></p>
      <p>4.1 We may use personal information for: administrative, operational
        and marketing purposes and to communicate with you about your use of
        the Services any changes to the Services. We will only pass on your information
        to other companies if it is necessary to perform the Services or with
        your prior consent. Those companies may contact you to inform you of
        their services and products. Any personal information that you choose
        to provide to us or to other companies using our Services will only be
        used in support of the intended purposes stated at the time at which
        it was collected and subject to any preferences indicated by you. <br>
  4.2 If you breach the Terms of Use your personal information may be passed
  to third parties, such as our legal advisors to the extent necessary to enable
  those third parties to resolve the matter. <br>
  4.3 If this business is sold or integrated with another business, your details
  may be disclosed to our advisors and any prospective purchasers and their advisors
  and will be passed on to the new owners of the business. <br>
  4.4 We may be obliged to disclose your personal information if required to
  do so by law. </p>
      <p><strong>5. Other Information </strong></p>
      <p>5.1 We may also collect and disclose information to third parties in
        aggregate (so that no individual members are identified) for statistical
        analysis and strategic development purposes. </p>
      <p><strong>6. Cookies </strong></p>
      <p>6.1 We may use "cookies" to collect aggregate information. A "Cookie" is
        a small piece of information sent by our web server to your web browser,
        which enables us to record anonymous details and allows you to move around
        the Site faster. We may use cookies for a number of purposes, for instance
        to enable us to simplify the logging on process, to help ensure the security
        and authenticity of members and to enable traffic monitoring. You can
        find out more about the way cookies work on <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">http://www.cookiecentral.com </a>. <br>
  6.2 Most browsers allow you to turn off the cookie function. If you want to
  know how to do this, please look at the help menu on your browser. However,
  if you turn off the cookie function your use of the Services may be impaired. </p>
      <p><strong>7. Overseas </strong></p>
      <p>7.1 We will only pass on information about you as an individual (as
        opposed to aggregate information) to third parties overseas to enable
        us to perform services requested by you. <br>
  7.2 Owing to the global nature of the Internet, the information you provide
  may be transferred in transit to countries outside the European Economic Area
  that do not have similar protections in place regarding your data and its use
  as set out in this policy. However, we do our best to ensure that your personal
  information is secure. </p>
      <p><strong>8. Security </strong></p>
      <p>8.1 As required by under UK data protection laws, we follow strict security
        procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have
        given to us, to prevent unauthorised access. We use industry standard
        technology to encrypt your personal information. However, the Internet
        is not a secure environment and we cannot guarantee the security of any
        information which you send to us. </p>
      <p><strong>9. Other websites </strong></p>
      <p>9.1 Our Site may contain links to other websites which are outside our
        control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other
        websites using the links provided, the operators of these websites may
        collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance
        with their privacy practices, which may differ from ours. </p>
      <p><strong>10. Updating your details </strong></p>
      <p>10.1 If you wish to update any of your personal details at any time,
        for example if you change your e-mail address, or you do not wish to
        receive information about a particular product or service, or if you
        wish to close your membership account, please update your membership
        details as instructed on the Site and your details will be updated as
        soon as is reasonably practicable. <br>
  10.2 If you delete your account, other companies with which you have registered
  via the Services may continue to process your data but they should not contact
  you without your consent. </p>
      <p><strong>11. Access rights </strong></p>
      <p>11.1 You have a right to access the personal data that is held about
        you. To obtain a copy of the personal information we hold about you,
        please write to: Privacy Officer, Sign-Up Technologies Limited, 60 Maltings
