    <h1>Privacy and Sign-Up.to </h1>
    <p>We take the privacy of client and end user data very seriously. The entire
      Sign-Up.to system is designed to provide all parties with complete control
      over their data.</p>
    <p>We believe that your personal data is your own, and you should control
      it. Because of this Sign-Up.to do not rent, sell or otherwise disclose
      data to 3rd parties unless we are required to by law. </p>
    <p>As a subscriber to a company who uses Sign-Up.to you have complete access
      to data stored on you - simply log in at <a href="http://subscriber.sign-up.to">http://subscriber.sign-up.to</a> and
      you can view, edit and delete your data completely free of charge.</p>
    <p>That's the short version. Because our lawyers like to earn their fees,
      they insisted that we also have the long version below...</p>
    <h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
    <p> Sign-Up Technologies Limited (referred to in this Privacy Policy as "SuTL", "we", "us" or "our")
      is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how
      we use the information we collect about you through Sign-UpT, how you can
      instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and procedures
      that we have in place to safeguard your privacy. This Privacy Policy forms
      part of the <a href="http://www.sign-up.to/html/consumer/terms.shtml">Terms
      of Use </a></p>
    <p><strong>1. Contact details </strong></p>

    </p>
    <p><strong>2. Introduction </strong></p>
    <p>2.1 We are registered under, and process personal data in accordance with,
      the United Kingdom's data protection laws. <br>
  2.2 This Privacy Policy covers the provision of the Services only and not any
  other companies' websites which you may access from the Site or by using the
  Services. <br>
  2.3 If we change the Privacy Policy we will place notices on the Site and post
  the changes on this page. If you do not accept any changes to the Privacy Policy
  please stop using the Services and close your membership account. </p>
    <p><strong>3. Personal Information Collected </strong></p>
    <p>3.1 We will only collect personal information about you that you have
      given, either: <br>
  (a) when you register for the Services; or <br>
  (b) if you have previously registered your details with a company which has
  since joined the Sign-Up Services. <br>
  3.2 When you register to use the Services you will be asked to provide personal
  information such as your name, postal and e-mail addresses, contact telephone
  numbers, date of birth, gender and other lifestyle information. </p>
    <p><strong>4. Use of personal Information </strong></p>
    <p>4.1 We may use personal information for: administrative, operational and
      marketing purposes and to communicate with you about your use of the Services
      any changes to the Services. We will only pass on your information to other
      companies if it is necessary to perform the Services or with your prior
      consent. Those companies may contact you to inform you of their services
      and products. Any personal information that you choose to provide to us
      or to other companies using our Services will only be used in support of
      the intended purposes stated at the time at which it was collected and
      subject to any preferences indicated by you. <br>
  4.2 If you breach the Terms of Use your personal information may be passed
  to third parties, such as our legal advisors to the extent necessary to enable
  those third parties to resolve the matter. <br>
  4.3 If this business is sold or integrated with another business, your details
  may be disclosed to our advisors and any prospective purchasers and their advisors
  and will be passed on to the new owners of the business. <br>
  4.4 We may be obliged to disclose your personal information if required to
  do so by law. </p>
    <p><strong>5. Other Information </strong></p>
    <p>5.1 We may also collect and disclose information to third parties in aggregate
      (so that no individual members are identified) for statistical analysis
      and strategic development purposes. </p>
    <p><strong>6. Cookies </strong></p>
    <p>6.1 We may use "cookies" to collect aggregate information. A "Cookie" is
      a small piece of information sent by our web server to your web browser,
      which enables us to record anonymous details and allows you to move around
      the Site faster. We may use cookies for a number of purposes, for instance
      to enable us to simplify the logging on process, to help ensure the security
      and authenticity of members and to enable traffic monitoring. You can find
      out more about the way cookies work on <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">http://www.cookiecentral.com </a>. <br>
  6.2 Most browsers allow you to turn off the cookie function. If you want to
  know how to do this, please look at the help menu on your browser. However,
  if you turn off the cookie function your use of the Services may be impaired. </p>
    <p><strong>7. Overseas </strong></p>
    <p>7.1 We will only pass on information about you as an individual (as opposed
      to aggregate information) to third parties overseas to enable us to perform
      services requested by you. <br>
  7.2 Owing to the global nature of the Internet, the information you provide
  may be transferred in transit to countries outside the European Economic Area
  that do not have similar protections in place regarding your data and its use
  as set out in this policy. However, we do our best to ensure that your personal
  information is secure. </p>
    <p><strong>8. Security </strong></p>
    <p>8.1 As required by under UK data protection laws, we follow strict security
      procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have
      given to us, to prevent unauthorised access. We use industry standard technology
      to encrypt your personal information. However, the Internet is not a secure
      environment and we cannot guarantee the security of any information which
      you send to us. </p>
    <p><strong>9. Other websites </strong></p>
    <p>9.1 Our Site may contain links to other websites which are outside our
      control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other
      websites using the links provided, the operators of these websites may
      collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with
      their privacy practices, which may differ from ours. </p>
    <p><strong>10. Updating your details </strong></p>
    <p>10.1 If you wish to update any of your personal details at any time, for
      example if you change your e-mail address, or you do not wish to receive
      information about a particular product or service, or if you wish to close
      your membership account, please update your membership details as instructed
      on the Site and your details will be updated as soon as is reasonably practicable. <br>
  10.2 If you delete your account, other companies with which you have registered
  via the Services may continue to process your data but they should not contact
  you without your consent. </p>
    <p><strong>11. Access rights </strong></p>
    <p>11.1 You have a right to access the personal data that is held about you.
      To obtain a copy of the personal information we hold about you, please
      write to: Privacy Officer, Sign-Up Technologies Limited, 60 Maltings Place,
