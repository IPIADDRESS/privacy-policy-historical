                      5.1 We may also collect and disclose information to third

                      information. A “Cookie” is a small piece of 

                      information sent by our web server to your web browser, 

                      which enables us to record anonymous details and allows 

                      you to move around the Site faster. We may use cookies for 

                      a number of purposes, for instance to enable us to simplify 

                      the logging on process, to help ensure the security and 

                      authenticity of members and to enable traffic monitoring. 

                      You can find out more about the way cookies work on <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com" target="_blank">http://www.cookiecentral.com</a>. 

                      <br>

                      6.2 Most browsers allow you to turn off the cookie function. 

                      If you want to know how to do this, please look at the help 

                      menu on your browser. However, if you turn off the cookie 

                      function your use of the Services may be impaired.</p>

                      7.1 We will only pass on information about you as an individual 

                      (as opposed to aggregate information) to third parties overseas 

                      to enable us to perform services requested by you.<br>

                      7.2 Owing to the global nature of the Internet, the information 

                      you provide may be transferred in transit to countries outside 

                      the European Economic Area that do not have similar protections 

                      in place regarding your data and its use as set out in this 

                      policy. However, we do our best to ensure that your personal 

                      information is secure. </p>

                      strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure 

                      of information which you have given to us, to prevent unauthorised 

                      access. We use industry standard technology to encrypt your 

                      personal information. However, the Internet is not a secure 

                      environment and we cannot guarantee the security of any 

                      information which you send to us.</p>

                    <p class="textBlack"><span class="boldBlack">9. Other websites</span><br>

                      outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy 

                      Policy. If you access other websites using the links provided, 

                      the operators of these websites may collect information
