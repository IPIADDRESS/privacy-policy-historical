      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p> Sign-Up Technologies Limited (referred to in this Privacy Policy as 
        "SuTL", "we", "us" or "our") is 
        committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how 
        we use the information we collect about you through Sign-Upâ„¢, how 
        you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information 
        and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy. This Privacy 
        Policy forms part of the <a href="terms.shtml">Terms of Use</a> </p>
      <p><b>1. Contact details</b></p>

      </p>
      <p><b>2. Introduction</b></p>
      <p>2.1 We are registered under, and process personal data in accordance 
        with, the United Kingdom's data protection laws.<br>
        2.2 This Privacy Policy covers the provision of the Services only and 
        not any other companies' websites which you may access from the Site or 
        by using the Services. <br>
        2.3 If we change the Privacy Policy we will place notices on the Site 
        and post the changes on this page. If you do not accept any changes to 
        the Privacy Policy please stop using the Services and close your membership 
        account.</p>
      <p><b>3. Personal Information Collected</b></p>
      <p>3.1 We will only collect personal information about you that you have 
        given, either:<br>
        (a) when you register for the Services; or <br>
        (b) if you have previously registered your details with a company which 
        has since joined the Sign-Up Services.<br>
        3.2 When you register to use the Services you will be asked to provide 
        personal information such as your name, postal and e-mail addresses, contact 
        telephone numbers, date of birth, gender and other lifestyle information. 
      </p>
      <p><b>4. Use of personal Information</b></p>
      <p>4.1 We may use personal information for: administrative, operational 
        and marketing purposes and to communicate with you about your use of the 
        Services any changes to the Services. We will only pass on your information 
        to other companies if it is necessary to perform the Services or with 
        your prior consent. Those companies may contact you to inform you of their 
        services and products. Any personal information that you choose to provide 
        to us or to other companies using our Services will only be used in support 
        of the intended purposes stated at the time at which it was collected 
        and subject to any preferences indicated by you.<br>
        4.2 If you breach the Terms of Use your personal information may be passed 
        to third parties, such as our legal advisors to the extent necessary to 
        enable those third parties to resolve the matter. <br>
        4.3 If this business is sold or integrated with another business, your 
        details may be disclosed to our advisors and any prospective purchasers 
        and their advisors and will be passed on to the new owners of the business.<br>
        4.4 We may be obliged to disclose your personal information if required 
        to do so by law.</p>
      <p><b>5. Other Information</b></p>
      <p>5.1 We may also collect and disclose information to third parties in 
        aggregate (so that no individual members are identified) for statistical 
        analysis and strategic development purposes.</p>
      <p><b>6. Cookies</b></p>
      <p>6.1 We may use "cookies" to collect aggregate information. 
        A "Cookie" is a small piece of information sent by our web server 
        to your web browser, which enables us to record anonymous details and 
        allows you to move around the Site faster. We may use cookies for a number 
        of purposes, for instance to enable us to simplify the logging on process, 
        to help ensure the security and authenticity of members and to enable 
        traffic monitoring. You can find out more about the way cookies work on 
        <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">http://www.cookiecentral.com</a>. 
        <br>
        6.2 Most browsers allow you to turn off the cookie function. If you want 
        to know how to do this, please look at the help menu on your browser. 
        However, if you turn off the cookie function your use of the Services 
        may be impaired.</p>
      <p><b>7. Overseas</b></p>
      <p>7.1 We will only pass on information about you as an individual (as opposed 
        to aggregate information) to third parties overseas to enable us to perform 
        services requested by you.<br>
        7.2 Owing to the global nature of the Internet, the information you provide 
        may be transferred in transit to countries outside the European Economic 
        Area that do not have similar protections in place regarding your data 
        and its use as set out in this policy. However, we do our best to ensure 
        that your personal information is secure. </p>
      <p><b>8. Security</b></p>
      <p>8.1 As required by under UK data protection laws, we follow strict security 
        procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have 
        given to us, to prevent unauthorised access. We use industry standard 
        technology to encrypt your personal information. However, the Internet 
        is not a secure environment and we cannot guarantee the security of any 
        information which you send to us.</p>
      <p><b>9. Other websites</b></p>
      <p>9.1 Our Site may contain links to other websites which are outside our 
        control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other 
        websites using the links provided, the operators of these websites may 
        collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance 
        with their privacy practices, which may differ from ours.</p>
      <p><b>10. Updating your details</b></p>
      <p>10.1 If you wish to update any of your personal details at any time, 
        for example if you change your e-mail address, or you do not wish to receive 
        information about a particular product or service, or if you wish to close 
        your membership account, please update your membership details as instructed 
        on the Site and your details will be updated as soon as is reasonably 
        practicable.<br>
        10.2 If you delete your account, other companies with which you have registered 
        via the Services may continue to process your data but they should not 
        contact you without your consent.</p>
      <p><b>11. Access rights</b></p>
      <p>11.1 You have a right to access the personal data that is held about 
        you. To obtain a copy of the personal information we hold about you, please
