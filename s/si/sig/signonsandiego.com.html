SignOnSanDiego.com and The Union-Tribune Publishing Company are committed to bringing you information tailored to your individual needs. We also recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of your personally identifiable information. In adopting this privacy policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using personally identifiable information and your reasonable expectations of privacy. Please note: this policy applies only to information collected by SignOnSanDiego.com online, as specified below, and does not govern or apply to information collected or used by The Union-Tribune Publishing Company or its affiliates through other means. This policy does not cover practices of the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper.
<p>
<b>What personal information do I provide to SignOnSanDiego.com? </b><br>
SignOnSanDiego.com asks you to provide various types of demographic information to enhance your experience on our site. During registration to read "Today's Paper", SignOnSanDiego.com asks for information such as year of birth, gender, Zip code, country, and optional email address. The more information you provide, the better we are able to customize your experience. We may also ask you for other information at other times - such as when you enter a contest or participate in a promotion, when you post an online ad, when you participate in our message boards, or when you order products from us. Whenever you provide personal information to us, we will make an effort to link to our privacy policy. See below about "cookies" and what other information is collected.

In order to provide our service free of charge, we display advertisements. SignOnSanDiego.com delivers targeted advertisements on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old).

<b>What information do web servers collect?</b> <br>
Web servers serving SignOnSanDiego.com automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as which pages each user visits and the domain name (e.g., Cox.net) of visitors.

</p><p>
<b>What are cookies and how does SignOnSanDiego.com use them? </b><br>
SignOnSanDiego.com places a "cookie" on the browser of a user's computer to store and sometimes track information about you while you are on our Web site. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted our Web site; we may also use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as measuring certain traffic patterns. For example, cookies are used to ensure that you don't see the same ad too many times in a single session and that you do not have to reenter registration information during your visit. We may also use cookies to track your progress on our site. Advertising service vendors that serve ads into our site may also use their own cookies. You may opt-out of the cookies delivered by SignOnSanDiego.com by changing the setting on your browser. Please be aware that this will disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones delivered by SignOnSanDiego.com 

<b>Children under 13:</b> Do not send any information about yourself to us - including information like your name, address or e-mail address. In general, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If, in limited circumstances, we do knowingly collect personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will do so only with verified parental consent prior to collection. In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible. 
</p><p>
<b>Changes to Privacy Policy</b><br>
Any changes to our privacy policy will be communicated to you via email if you have registered for any of our services that require you to enter your email address.
</p><p>
<b><i>Registration Questions and Answers</i></b>
</p><p>
<b>Why are you asking me to provide this information?</b><br>
The registration process allows us to track the audience profile of our Web site. This enables us to provide greater demographic targeting for our advertisers and learn a little more about our users. So you may see advertisements that are more relevant to your interest. This information also helps to plan site improvements. 
</p><p>
<b>Do I have to provide this information to view content on SignOnSanDiego.com?</b><br>
If you wish to read "Today's Paper" online then you must answer the few anonymous questions of age, gender, zip code and country of residence. Providing your email address is optional. You will only be asked to provide this information once or once per Web browser. On other areas of our site registration is voluntary. If you don't complete the information, it will appear again on future visits. 
</p><p>
<b>Will I be emailed if I provide this information?</b>
The information in the registration process is anonymous. It does not personally identify you. We will only send you email if you voluntarily opted in to receive information from us, if you signed up for one of our email newsletters, or if you are otherwise doing business with SignOnSanDiego.com or the Union-Tribune. 
</p><p>
<b>What if I don't complete the registration survey?</b><br>
If you click the "Ask Me Later Button," the registration survey will appear again next time you visit the site after a 24 hour period. On the "Today's Paper" section, you will not be able to proceed until the registration information is submitted.
</p><p>
<b>How is this information stored?</b><br>
The answers you provide are kept in a small file on your computer called a "cookie." Virtually all Web sites use cookies. SignOnSanDiego.com can use the information in the cookie to send you relevant information and advertising. 
</p><p>
<b>Comments?</b><br>
Please send us any comments you have by email to <a href="mailto:customersupport@signonsandiego.com">customersupport@signonsandiego.com</a>
