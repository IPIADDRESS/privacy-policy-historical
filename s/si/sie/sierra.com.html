                    <p>Cookies are a feature of your Web browser that allows Web 
                      sites to transfer bits of information to your computer for 
                      record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer 
                      can be used to "remember" things like your password, or 
                      that you have already registered. This allows us to speed 
                      up your future activities, saving the time you would normally 
                      spend entering information such as your password or registration. 
                      In addition, Sierra may use cookies to retrieve user information
