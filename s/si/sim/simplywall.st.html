<h5>Links To Other Sites</h5>
<p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
<p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>
<h5>Children's Privacy</h5>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). For that reason, SWS does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of the SWS Service is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the SWS Service at any time or in any manner. Any person who provides their personal information to SWS through the SWS Service represents that they are 13 years of age or older. If SWS learns that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected without verifiable parental consent, then SWS will take the appropriate steps to delete this information from our servers.</p>
<h5>In the Event of Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy</h5>
<p>In the event that SWS should ever be acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the event of SWS’s bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, we may not be able to control how information that we have collected from Users is transferred or used.</p>
<h5>European Union</h5>
<p>SWS is a data controller and processor for the purposes of the GDPR and by your consenting to this Privacy Statement SWS is able to processes your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>
