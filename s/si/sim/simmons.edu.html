<h3>Information Provided by Visitors</h3>
<p><strong><br>
  When You Register for Alumnet<br>
    </strong>In order to have access to certain features, such as Alumnet, you
    must register in Alumnet so we can verify your status as an alumnae/i of
    Simmons and personalize the site to better meet your needs.</p>
	
	<p>If you decide to register with us online, you will be asked to provide personally
  identifiable information that may include a user name and password, your name,
  email address, postal address, telephone number, and your Student ID number.
  We store this information, along with your other preferences, on our secured
  server so that you need not reenter it when you return to the site.</p>
	<p><strong>Updating Your Alumnet Information<br>
      </strong>You may review, correct, update, or change your Alumnet profile
      information, including any personally identifiable information contained

	<p><strong>When You Deposit Online<br>
  </strong>Simmons will ask you to provide personally identifiable information
  necessary to complete your deposit, that can include your name, billing and
  shipping postal addresses, telephone number, and credit card number. This is
  the same information requested when you deposit by telephone or through the
  mail. When you make a deposit online, your credit card information will be
  temporarily stored on a secured 3 rd party processing server. We will retain
  the personally identifiable information you provided with your order for our
  records, to facilitate registration, and to inform you of your status. The

    for additional information required to complete and service your request,
    such as the names of any family members for events and co-donations. </p>
<p><br>
    <strong>When You Complete an Electronic Survey<br>
    </strong>The College occasionally posts surveys on its website or through
    email. Your participation in these surveys is on a completely voluntary and
    anonymous basis unless we inform you otherwise. We use the information in
    the responses to the survey to understand our visitors better and to determine
    how best to serve them. Personally identifiable information collected in
    our surveys is never sold, rented, or shared with third parties for their
    marketing purposes. </p>
