This privacy policy only applies to transactions made, and data gathered, on Simmons College websites and does not apply to any other website. The terms of this privacy policy shall govern all interactions with Simmons College through either the school's website or email. A link to the privacy policy can be found on the College's home page and on every page of the College's websites. By using Simmons College websites, RSS feeds or communicating with the College by email, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy.

<p>If you decide to register with us online, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information that may include a user name and password, your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and your Student ID number. We store this information, along with your other preferences, on our secured server so that you need not reenter it when you return to the site.</p>
