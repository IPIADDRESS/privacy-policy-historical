<div id="introduction"><strong>1.	INTRODUCTION</strong>


			<p>FX Networks, LLC ("FX"), which operates the FXNetworks.com website, has developed this Privacy Policy to describe how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through the entertainment-related websites (the "FX Sites"), mobile sites, applications ("apps"), widgets, and other content and services that are linked to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "FX Sites").</p>
			
			<p>By providing personal information to us and using the FX Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. To see a list of our affiliated companies ("FX Affiliates") <a href="http://www.21cf.com" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

			<p>As set forth in our <a href="http://www2.fxnetworks.com/settings/terms-of-use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>, the FX Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

			<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use some of the FX Services without being registered for an FX Service and those who have registered for one or more FX Service. This Privacy Policy applies to FX's collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally FX's practices for handling non-personal information (e.g., interests, demographics and services usage).</p>
		</div>

		<div id="collection">
			<strong>2.	COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</strong>

			<p>FX and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:</p>

			<p><b>Registration Information</b> is the information you submit to register for our FX Services, for example to create an FX account, receive a newsletter or mobile alert, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code, birthday, and phone number.</p>

			<p><b>Public Information and Posts</b> consist of comments or content that you post to the FX Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, and profile information. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.</p>

			<p><b>Social Media Information and Content.</b> If you access or log-in to an FX Service through a third party social media service or another website, app, service or log-in ("Other Service"), or connect an FX Service to Other Services, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that Other Service, any information or content you have permitted the Other Service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends' lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that Other Service (collectively, "Social Media Information and Content"). When you access the FX Services through Other Services, or when you connect an FX Service to Other Services, you are authorizing FX to collect, store, and use any and all Social Media Information and Content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
			
			<p><b>Authenticated Content.</b> To access certain video content via the FX Services, you will be redirected to your television content provider's registration page where you will be required to register directly with your television content provider. Please contact your television content provider directly for questions on your account, including how to access or cancel your account. Any information that you provide to your television content provider will be subject to the applicable television content provider's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any television content provider's use of information collected via the FX Services.</p>
			<a name="advertising-choices"></a>
			<p><b>Site Activity Information.</b> When you access and interact with the FX Services, FX and our service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the FX Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the FX Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device in order to provide the FX Services to it.</p>

			<p>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier, may also be used. Websites, apps, and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or other device so the website, app or other service can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website, app or other service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the FX Services, such as pages you have visited, the videos and other content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.</p>

			<p>Third parties that support the FX Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate FX Service usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the FX Services or third party service. FX does not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/consumers</a>, and to opt-out of such ad networks' and services' advertising practices, go to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>

			<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies" target="_blank">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies</a>). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the FX Services.</p>

			<p><b>Information from Other Sources.</b> To improve the quality of the FX Services, we and our service providers may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information from social media services, commercially available sources and information from our FX Affiliates or business partners.</p>
		
			<p><b>Do Not Track Signals.</b> At this time we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="notice">
			<strong>3. NOTICE AND CHOICE</strong>

			<p><b>Linked Services.</b> The FX Services may also be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. FX is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies and once you leave the FX Services via a link, enable an unaffiliated service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the unaffiliated service.</p>
			
			<p>In addition, FX is not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, Apple, Google, Microsoft or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including in connection with any information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the FX Services.</p>
			
			<p><b>Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service.</b> In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments ("Payment Service"). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service web page. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service's use of information collected through any Payment Service.</p>

			<p><b>To contact you.</b> FX may periodically send promotional materials (e.g., newsletters) or notifications related to the FX Services to the email address you provided to us at registration or for your account. If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from an FX Service, you can change your FX account setting, or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email, or send an email to <a href="mailto:FX.Privacy@fox.com">FX.Privacy@fox.com</a>. There are certain service notification emails that you may not opt-out of, such as notifications of changes to the FX Services or policies. If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.</p>

			<p><b>To share with our Affiliates.</b> FX may share your information with FX Affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. A link to a website that lists FX Affiliates can be found at the beginning of this policy. Users who visit FX Affiliates' services should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.</p>

			<p><b>To share with business partners.</b> FX may share your information with business partners to permit them to send you marketing communications, consistent with your choices.</p>

			<p><b>To protect the rights of FX and others.</b> There may be instances when FX may use or disclose your information without providing notice or choice, including situations where FX has a good faith belief that such use or disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of FX, our FX Affiliates or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our Terms of Use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the FX Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.</p>

			<p><b>To complete a merger or sale of assets.</b> If FX sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business (including, without limitation, in connection with bankruptcy or a similar proceeding), FX may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</p>

			<p>When the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with third parties. In some instances, we may combine that information with personal information, such as combining your zip code with your name. If we combine this information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information as long as it is combined.</p>

		<div id="security">
			<strong>5.	SECURITY</strong>

			<p>FX uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information.</p>

			<strong>6.	USER CONTROL</strong>

			<p>If you would like to access, review, correct, update, suppress, or otherwise limit our use of your personal information you have previously provided directly to us, you may contact us using the mechanisms provided below. In your request, please include your email address, name, address, and telephone number and specify clearly what information you would like to access, change, update and/or whether you would like to have your personal information suppressed from our database, or if you have other questions about your personal information.

			<p>You may request that we not share your personal information on a going-forward basis with FX Affiliates or unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes by sending an email to <a href="mailto:FX.californiaprivacy@fox.com">FX.californiaprivacy@fox.com</a>, with "Disclosure Opt-out" in the subject line and your full name, email address, and postal address in the body of the email.

			<strong>7.	DATA RETENTION</strong>

			<p>We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by applicable law.</p>

			<p>Remember that even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with Other Services. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. It is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines.</p>

		<div id="sensitive">
			<strong>8.	SENSITIVE INFORMATION</strong>
