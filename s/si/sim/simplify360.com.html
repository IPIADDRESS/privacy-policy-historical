<p class="intro">Effective Date: July 30, 2010</p>
	<p>Simplify360 (“Simplify360”) provides media monitoring, analytics and engagement services (“Service”) to businesses (“Customers”). 
	In order to provide the Service, Simplify360 collects real time social media conversations from public websites, social networking 
	sites and forums.  </p>
	<p>Simplify360 recognizes that Privacy is important, and that individuals have the right to know and understand what is being done 
	with personal information that pertains to them, the choices available to them, and the steps that they can take to access this personal 
	information, and to request that inaccurate information be deleted.</p>
	<p>In this document, "personal information" means information that pertains to an identified or identifiable individual (a “Data Subject”). 
	For example, personal information may include first and last name, user name, physical or electronic mail address, telephone number, or photograph. 
	It may include statements or opinions of a Data Subject, such as a request for information or a search query, if it can be associated 
	to that individual.</p>
	<p class="intro">1. ONLY FOR INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THIS SITE</p>
	<p>This Privacy Statement applies only to the personal information that Simplify360 may collect through the website simplify360.com (the "Site") 
	and to the activities in which Simplify360 engages through the Site. It does not apply to personal information that is contained in material to 
	which Simplify360 has access in connection with its Services, or to Simplify360's other activities offline. Different privacy policies apply to 
	other aspects of our business.</p>

		of the visits, or the click through. You can choose to block access to cookies, but certain portions of the Site may not be available to you. Pixel 
		tags cannot be removed because they reside in the code of the Site, rather than on the user's computer</p>
		<p>You can also choose to have your browser delete all cookies after the end of a session. In this case, we may not recognize you when you return to our 
		Site, and you may have to provide again certain information before accessing certain areas of the Site</p>
		<li>Children</li>
		<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years old. If we determine that any personal information 
		that we hold pertains to a child under 13, we immediately delete or block such information or any document containing such information.</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="intro">4. HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
		<p>We use the personal information that we collect from users on the Site to respond to inquiries made by them, such as requests for information,

		better understand how our users use the Site, the geographic area where they reside, and generally to improve the Site usage and performance.</p>
	<p class="intro">5. WITH WHOM WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
	<ul class="sub_dots">
		<li>Service Providers</li>
		<p>Like most organizations, we use service providers, which act on our behalf, or provide us with technical and other capabilities to operate our

	<p class="intro">6. RETENTION</p>
	<p>We keep the personal information that we collect only as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was collected. In addition, 
	applicable laws or regulations, or specific requests from government authorities may require us to preserve and retain information for a longer period.</p>
	<p>When personal information is no longer required for our purposes, we will destroy, delete, erase or convert it into an anonymous form. We cannot 
	ensure the permanent removal of your information. For example, it may remain in our archives or backup copies until the next update of our archives or back-ups.</p>
	<p class="intro">7. SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY</p>
	<p>We take reasonable steps to maintain physical, procedural, and technical security in our premises, information systems, and information storage
