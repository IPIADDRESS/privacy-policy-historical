                 <p>Simplify360 (“Simplify360”) provides media monitoring, analytics and engagement services (“Service”) to businesses (“Customers”). In order to provide the Service, Simplify360 collects real time social media conversations from public websites, social networking sites and forums.</p>

                <p>Simplify360 recognizes that Privacy is important, and that individuals have the right to know and understand what is being done with personal information that pertains to them, the choices available to them, and the steps that they can take to access this personal information, and to request that inaccurate information be deleted.</p>

                <p>In this document, "personal information" means information that pertains to an identified or identifiable individual (a “Data Subject”). For example, personal information may include first and last name, user name, physical or electronic mail address, telephone number, or photograph. It may include statements or opinions of a Data Subject, such as a request for information or a search query, if it can be associated to that individual.</p>

                <p>ONLY FOR INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THIS SITE</p>

                <p>This Privacy Statement applies only to the personal information that Simplify360 may collect through the website simplify360.com (the "Site") and to the activities in which Simplify360 engages through the Site. It does not apply to personal information that is contained in material to which Simplify360 has access in connection with its Services, or to Simplify360's other activities offline. Different privacy policies apply to other aspects of our business.</p>

                <p>CONSENT AND CHOICE</p>

                <p>Consent</p>

                <p>By using the simplify360.com Site, or providing personal information through the Site, you agree and consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of all personal information that we collect from you as a result of your use of the Site in accordance with the terms below.</p>

                <p>Choice</p>

                <p>If we change our personal information collection or use practices in a material way, we will provide users with advance notice of the proposed changes.</p>

                <p>HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>

                <p>Forms and questionnaires</p>

                <p>We collect personal information through forms or questionnaires that are posted on our Site, for example, in areas where we offer users access to newsletters, white papers and other material that Simplify360 has developed for distribution to third parties. This information may include name, address, telephone number, company name, or e-mail address, or the nature of a query made. In all such cases, you choose whether to provide us with the personally identifiable information.</p>

                <p>Browser information</p>

                <p>We collect information that is provided by each user's browser, such as the IP address, user language, operating system, browser type, the presence/absence of "flash" plug-ins, screen resolution, or connection type.</p>

                <p>Information about use of the Site</p>

                <p>We use cookies and pixel tags in order to gather information about how each user uses the Site, such as the time spent on a page, the frequency of the visits, or the click through. You can choose to block access to cookies, but certain portions of the Site may not be available to you. Pixel tags cannot be removed because they reside in the code of the Site, rather than on the user's computer.</p>

                <p>You can also choose to have your browser delete all cookies after the end of a session. In this case, we may not recognize you when you return to our Site, and you may have to provide again certain information before accessing certain areas of the Site.</p>

                <p>Children</p>

                <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years old. If we determine that any personal information that we hold pertains to a child under 13, we immediately delete or block such information or any document containing such information.</p>

                <p>HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>

                <p>We use the personal information that we collect from users on the Site to respond to inquiries made by them, such as requests for information, request for a brochure or a white paper, request for a meeting, or to contact them when they have provided contact information. We also use the personal information collected through the Site in aggregated form for statistical and web analytics purposes, in order to better understand how our users use the Site, the geographic area where they reside, and generally to improve the Site usage and performance.</p>

                <p>WITH WHOM WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>

                <p>Service Providers</p>

                <p>Like most organizations, we use service providers, which act on our behalf, or provide us with technical and other capabilities to operate our business. For example: communications or hosting. We require these organizations to agree in writing to use any personal information to which they have access solely to provide their services to Simplify360, to protect any personal or confidential information to which they may have access in the course of their services, and to comply with all applicable legal requirements.</p>

                <p>Legal process</p>

                <p>We may disclose personal information to third parties (a) if we are required to do so by law; (b) if we believe that it is necessary in order to conform to the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with legal process served on us; (c) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; (d) if we believe, upon reasonable grounds, that it is necessary to protect the rights or property of Simplify360 or its customers; (e) if we believe it is necessary to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that Simplify360 may sustain, or to collect monies owed to Simplify360.</p>

                <p>Corporate transactions</p>

                <p>We may transfer personal information to another organization in the event of a merger or change of ownership of all or part of Simplify360. In this event, we will request the transferee to treat personal information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.</p>

                <p>Onward transfers</p>

                <p>If we elect to transfer or disclose personal information to a third party, we will enter into a written agreement with this third party requiring the third party to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is set forth in this Privacy Statement.</p>

                <p>Third party marketing</p>

                <p>We do not provide personally identifiable information to any third parties for their own marketing purposes. If our practices change, we will provide you with advance notices of the change.</p>

                <p>RETENTION</p>

                <p>We keep the personal information that we collect only as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was collected. In addition, applicable laws or regulations, or specific requests from government authorities may require us to preserve and retain information for a longer period.</p>

                <p>When personal information is no longer required for our purposes, we will destroy, delete, erase or convert it into an anonymous form. We cannot ensure the permanent removal of your information. For example, it may remain in our archives or backup copies until the next update of our archives or back-ups.</p>

                <p>SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY</p>

                <p>We take reasonable steps to maintain physical, procedural, and technical security in our premises, information systems, and information storage facilities in order to protect personal information in our custody from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, erroneous disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We restrict access to personal information to those individuals who need access to that information in order to assist us in providing our services.</p>

Any activity conducted under your username and password will be attributed to you.</p>

When we collect Social Media Content via our Web crawling technology, we abide by the applicable Web sites’ robots.txt protocols. We do not circumvent technical controls in place to prevent unauthorized access, such as usernames and passwords or use of CAPTCHA technology. Our Web crawlers are designed to limit crawling to portions of Web sites that are made public by the applicable Web site operator.
