<p class="arial12" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>&nbsp;A NOTE TO 
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 --OPPA)</strong></font></p>
<p class="arial12" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is 
the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the California Act.&nbsp; Various 
provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the act.&nbsp; In 
summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all 
visitors.&nbsp; This is not usually personally identifiable.&nbsp; If you purchase a 
product or service via this website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the 
purchase agreement you electronically sign prior to purchase allows the website 
to collect and archive all the personal information you provide and to transmit 
and/or transfer that personal information to third parties.&nbsp; There is no way you 
can modify this information and you have no right to do so.&nbsp; Under the terms of 
the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or receive any information 
about our database.&nbsp; In the event that the website, under advice of counsel 
agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must submit whatever 
information is demanded by the website in insure that the website is releasing 
information to the correct party.&nbsp; Other provisions of the OPPA may exempt this 
website from complying.&nbsp; While we take measures to ensure that outside parties 
do not have access to any information we have about you, we do not warranty that 
outside parties will not breach our system and thus have access to your 
information.&nbsp; (You should know that merchant service providers do not allow us 
access to your credit card information.)&nbsp; This Privacy Policy also is subject to 
change without notice.&nbsp; You are required to read it prior to using the website.&nbsp; 

By interacting with the website you agree to the terms and conditions of the 
Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By using the website or purchasing a product through this 
website, you waive the right to use state or federal court systems to address 
complaints and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration Association

<p class="arial12" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>&nbsp;ABOUT THE 
PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</strong></font></p>
<p class="arial12" align="justify"><font face="Arial">This website routinely 
collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers.&nbsp; 
This information is obtained in various ways, such as:</font></p>
<p class="arial12"><font face="Arial"><strong>VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR 
CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</strong></font></p>
<p class="arial12" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Registration means that 
the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to 
communicate information to this website.&nbsp; This can include pages or 'pop ups' 
where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can 
include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting 
information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining 
an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be 
from ordering a product.</font></p>
<p class="arial12"><font face="Arial">Occasionally complete credit card 
information may be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form rather than 
regular secure merchant service processing.&nbsp; This information is kept at the 
highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant 
service provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.</font></p>

<p class="arial12"><font face="Arial"><strong>ONLINE ORDERING</strong></font></p>
<p class="arial12"><font face="Arial">Online ordering via SSL encrypted 
communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service 
companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but does 
not provide complete credit card numbers.&nbsp; In the process of online ordering, 
the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, 
CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password.&nbsp; You should 
consider all this information available to the website.&nbsp; This information is 
used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve 
its use for general solicitation purposes.</font></p>
<p class="arial12"><font face="Arial"><strong>VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</strong></font></p>
<p class="arial12" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Website visitors who wish 
to communicate with the website do so under two conditions:&nbsp; one, they give 
their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any 
submission provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy 
Policy.&nbsp; While your email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is 
added to the website's general solicitation database.</font></p>

<p class="arial12"><font face="Arial"><strong>CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS</strong></font></p>
<p class="arial12" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>If you 
are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you communicate with the 
site by phone or mail, the website collects information about your communication 
and by communicating with the site you give your permission to collect, archive, 
retrieve, and otherwise use any information collected as the site sees fit.</font></p>

its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for 
commercial purposes.</font></p>
