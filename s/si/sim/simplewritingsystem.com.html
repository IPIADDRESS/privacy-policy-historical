                                      asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard
                                      drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own
                                      cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to
                                      protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the
                                      cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other
                                      sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would
                                      prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your
                                      browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies,
                                      it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively

                                      Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to
