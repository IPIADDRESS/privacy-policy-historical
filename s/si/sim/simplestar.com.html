            <p>Depending on how you interact with us, we process different kinds of data and in different ways.
                Some data is automatically processed if you visit our Sites or use our Products. Other data is only

            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>We process Website Usage Data to allow you to surf the Site and to ensure its functionality. We also
                process Website Usage Data to perform analyses on the performance of the Site, to continuously

            <p class="blues">Data we process if you use our Products:</p>
            <p>Corel processes Personal Data when you install and register one of our Products. Some of this
                information will be processed automatically when installing our Products. This includes the following
                “<b>Product Installation Data</b>”:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>your browser type</li>
                <li>operating system</li>
                <li>device hardware</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>We request certain “<b>Product Registration Data</b>” during installation of our Products. Although only
                email address is mandatory for registration, we may ask you to submit other information, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>your name</li>
                <li>postal address, including country</li>
                <li>telephone number</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>We use Product Installation Data and Product Registration Data to keep a record of your product
                license (that is, authenticating and periodically verifying your licensing rights in the product for anti-
                piracy purposes) and to enable the provision of maintenance or support services to you. We will also
                use this information to provide in-product messaging with information about products, features, or
                services offered by Corel.</p>
            <p>We collect information about the way you use our Products after you have installed and registered
                them. The specific “<b>Product Usage Data</b>” varies depending upon which Product you are using, but

                <li>Feature usage</li>
                <li>Page clicks</li>
                <li>Sign-in information</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>We process Product Usage Data so that we can facilitate, evaluate, and verify your use of our
                products and services. We will also use the Product Usage Data for our own internal statistical and
                analytical purposes, and to evaluate and enhance users' experience of the Products by identifying
                customer preferences and analyzing crash data.</p>
            <p>In addition, certain of our products may allow you to store, send, receive, edit, sync, share, or
                otherwise organize or manage files and folders (including any information or data stored in those
                folders) (“<b>User Files</b>”). We will record and store information regarding the size and name of all User
                Files that you make available via these Products.</p>
            <p class="blues">Data we process only if you submit it to us:</p>
            <p>When you interact with us on our Sites or using our Products, you can submit Personal Data to us in
                various situations, including:</p>
            <p><b>Account Data:</b> On some of our Sites (“Interactive Sites”), you can register for an account
                with your e-mail address and a password you create. If you register one of our Products,
                you will automatically create an account you can use to manage your licensed Products and
                communication settings, including making updates to your Personal Data. On Interactive Sites, you
                can create a profile, which may include your Personal Data. We will store your account data for you
                to be able to communicate with others on our interactive Sites. Some of our Interactive Sites offer
                publicly accessible blogs or forums. Any information you provide in these areas may be read,

                the community pages as an unregistered user.</p>
            <p><b>Transaction Data:</b> In relation to purchases you may make online or over the telephone, we will

            <p><b>Customer Support Data:</b> You can communicate with us through the different web-forms and chat
                functionalities on our Sites. For example, you can use the contact forms to request technical

                support team. In order to respond to your request, we will process your IP address and contact data
                as well as the contents of your request. We will delete this data as soon as we have complied with
                your request.</p>
            <p><b>Survey Data:</b> From time to time we may conduct surveys in respect of our products and services.
                Participation in our surveys is optional. However, if you respond to one of our surveys, you may
                provide us with personal information about you. Unless you otherwise consent, we will only use this
                information to determine the types of Products that may be of interest to you and to operate and
                improve our Product offerings.</p>
            <p><b>Email/Direct Mail Campaign Data:</b> From time to time, we may contact our customers directly by

                contact you with any commercial communications that are unrelated to the Products that you have
                purchased from us unless you have given us your prior consent to receiving such information. When
                responding to one of these campaigns, you may have the option to provide us with personal
                information, which we will use for the purpose indicated. See Section 5 below for information on
                how to change your account’s communication preferences.</p>
            <p><b>Special Collaborative Programs:</b>
                We may collaborate with another company to provide you with a
                unique product or service (a “<b>Collaborative Program</b>”). Our use of your Personal Data is limited to
                the specific Collaborative Program that you have joined or elected to use and we will disclose to you
                the specific Personal Data we will share and for what purpose before sharing with our collaboration
                partner.</p>
            <p><b>Applicant Data:</b> If you would like to apply for employment with Corel, you can apply online at

                application unless you give us your explicit consent to keep your application on file to contact you
                with further job offers in the future.</p>
            <p><b>Business Contact or Sales Prospect Data:</b> If you are a business contact or sales prospect
                that has provided us your Personal Data, we will store your data in our database so that
                we can follow up on previous business conversations we’ve had with you, provide you additional
                information about our Products, or assist you in purchasing our Products. We may also share your
                Personal Data with sales representatives employed with our local affiliates or resellers so that they
                can work with you to complete any requested purchase of our Products.</p>
            <p class="uppercase"><b>2. Sharing Personal Data with Third Parties</b></p>
            <p>We treat your Personal Data with care and confidentially and will only pass it on to third parties to
                the extent described below and not beyond. We do not share, sell, rent, or trade Personal Data with
                third parties for any promotional purposes. Where our affiliates, resellers, or service providers
                process Personal Data, they will do so solely on our instructions and have undertaken to comply with
                strict contractual requirements for the security of your data (including, but not limited to, complying
                with this Privacy Statement).</p>
            <p><b>Affiliated Companies:</b> Corel is a global company, with subsidiaries worldwide, including in the USA, Germany,
                the UK, Japan, China, and Taiwan. We share data with our subsidiaries in the ordinary course of our business.
                For example, if one of our resellers makes contact with you on our behalf, this data will be shared with the
                relevant Corel subsidiary, such as Corel GmbH in Germany. For an overview of our affiliates, you can refer to
                the Contact Us page at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.corel.com/en/contact-us/">https://www.corel.com/en/contact-us/</a> to view the mailing addresses of our local
                affiliates.</p>
            <p><b>Service Providers:</b> Corel transmits data to service providers that enable us to provide our Site and
                market, sell, and deliver our Products. This includes the parties providing our third-party cookies and
                tracking tools, as well as parties providing us with services to assist us in processing transactions,
                including credit card transactions, handling shipping and processing of orders, providing customer
                support, managing customer relationships (like Saleforce.com), hosting the Sites (like Amazon Web
                Services), collecting, storing, or removing your information, or performing statistical analysis of our
                Sites (such as Google). We occasionally also share Personal Data with independent auditors acting on
                our behalf, for anti-piracy or revenue accounting purposes in connection with the internal operations
                of our business. We sometimes need to share your information with these companies in order for
                them to provide the applicable services.</p>
            <p><b>Business Transactions:</b> In the event Corel goes through a business transaction such as a merger, an
                acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets to which this Privacy
                Statement relates, your information will likely be among the assets transferred and, in such case, you
                will be notified in advance via email and/or a prominent notice on our Sites of such change in
                ownership or a change in the use of your Personal Data, as well as any choices you may have
                regarding your Personal Data (including, if applicable, your right to object to such transfer).</p>
            <p><a>Public Authorities:</a> Although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose
                personal information when required by law, such as when we have a good-faith belief that such
                action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or litigation or other
                legal process or action (whether or not initiated by Corel) to protect Corel's, our users' or third
                parties' rights, property or safety. We will transmit data to public authorities such as law
                enforcement or tax authorities only in the case of a legal obligation to do so based on a request for
                information from the respective authority.</p>
            <p><b>Promotional Offers:</b> As a registered Corel customer, you have the opportunity to receive
                news and special offers from Corel regarding our Products or the products of third parties
                who we think may offer products or services that would be of interest to you.</p>
            <p class="uppercase"><b>3. Timeframe for Keeping Data</b></p>
            <p>We process and store your Personal Data as long as necessary for the fulfillment of our contractual or
                legal obligations. Thus, we store the data as long as our contractual relationship with you as our
                customer obliges us to do so. After termination of our contract, we will store Personal Data only to
                the extent and for as long as applicable law requires. All other data will be deleted immediately when
                you, as a customer, unsubscribe from our Products or other services. If the remaining data is no
                longer required for the fulfillment of legal obligations, it will be regularly deleted, unless its further
                processing is necessary for the preservation of evidence or the prevention of legal claims from
                becoming time-barred.</p>
            <p class="uppercase"><b>4. Reviewing and Requesting Changes to Your Information</b></p>
            <p style="text-align: center; color: red; font-weight: bold">EU users: please refer to Section 6 below for your statutory rights under the GDPR</p>
            <p>Upon request, Corel will make a reasonable effort to inform you regarding whether we hold any of

            <p>If you have signed up to receive marketing emails from Corel, you can opt-out of receiving future
                marketing emails by following the foregoing process. Customers cannot opt-out of receiving all
                transactional emails related to their Corel account, but may change their account settings (as
                described above) to reduce the frequency or eliminate certain Corel notification emails.</p>

            <p>You are not legally required to provide Corel with the Personal Data described in this Privacy
                Statement. Further, the contractual relationship that you might have entered into with us by

                this Privacy Statement. These purposes represent our legitimate interests for the purposes of
                Article 6 (1) f) GDPR. At the same time, some of the Personal Data we process is necessary for us to
                perform a contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract
                with you. For example, if you express your interest in purchasing one of our Products, such as by
                filling out a webform, we will process the Personal Data submitted to comply with your request. This
                may include sharing your Personal Data with one of our authorized resellers, who will then use your
                Personal Data to complete the purchase transaction. In addition, we are legally obliged to provide
                certain information to criminal prosecution or tax authorities in individual cases upon request. In
                these cases, the legal basis for the processing is either legal requirements (Article 6 (1) c) GDPR) or
                reasons of public interest (Article 6 (1) e) GDPR).</p>
            <p class="blues">Transferring your Data outside the EU or the EEA</p>
            <p>Corel’s principal place of business is in Canada, which is a “<b>Third Country</b>” under the GDPR. Third
                Countries are generally not considered to afford the same level of protection that you enjoy in the
                EU, but Corel still provides an adequate level of protection for your Personal Data - decision
                2002/2/EC of the EU Commission states that Canada is deemed to provide an adequate level of data
                protection regarding commercial organizations such as Corel.</p>
            <p>We have ensured that our service providers and affiliates have either certified under the EU-U.S.
                Privacy Shield Framework and will process all Personal Data received from EU member states in
                reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework or that they have been subjected to strict contractual
                provisions in their contract with us to guarantee that an adequate level of data protection for your
                data is guaranteed.</p>
            <p class="blues">User Profiles</p>
            <p>We use your data for "<b>Profiling</b>". This means that we use your data to make tailored offers based on
                your previous behavior as well as to serve you personalized ads. However, we will never process and
                analyze your Personal Data in the context of Profiling in a way would lead to an automated decision
                that has a legal effect on you or significantly impairs you in a similar way.</p>
            <p class="blues">Your rights regarding the processing of your Personal Data</p>
            <p>As a natural person, you have certain rights as “<b>Data Subject</b>”. You can assert the following rights
                against us under the GDPR:</p>
            <p>Your right to information and access under Article 15 GDPR,
                <br>
                Your right to correction under Article 16 GDPR,
                <br>
                Your right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR,
                <br>
                Your right to restriction of processing under Article 18 GDPR, and
                <br>
                Your right to data transferability under Article 20 GDPR.</p>
            <p>In addition, you have a right of objection to the competent data protection supervisory authority
                under Article 77 GDPR, but only with respect to the data processing we conduct on our own behalf,
                as a controller. In the event Corel acts as a processor of your data for a third party, you must refer to
                the entity acting as controller to assert this right.</p>
            <div class="gdpr-article">
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Information about your Right of Objection under Article 21 GDPR</b></p>
                <p><u>1. Right of objection in individual cases</u></p>
                <p>In addition to the rights already mentioned, you have the right, for reasons arising from your
                    particular situation, to object at any time to the processing of Personal Data relating to you, which is
                    processed on the basis of Article 6 (1) e) GDPR (data processing in the public interest) and Article 6
                    (1) f) GDPR (data processing on the basis of a balance of interests); this also applies to profiling based
                    on this provision within the meaning of Article 4 (4) GDPR. If you file an objection, we will no longer
                    process your Personal Data unless we can prove compelling grounds for the processing that outweigh
                    your interests, rights and freedoms or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal
                    claims. Please also note that, if we terminate the processing due to your objection, the Sites or
                    Products may no longer be available to you or only to a limited extent.</p>
                <p><u>2. The right to object to the processing of data for advertising purposes</u></p>
                <p>You also have the right to object at any time to the processing of your Personal Data for the purpose
                    of direct marketing, including any subscription to our newsletters or personalized ads; this also
                    applies to Profiling, insofar as it is associated with such direct marketing. If you object, we will no
                    longer process your Personal Data in the future.</p>
