<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal">Your privacy is very important to SIMPLEHELIX, INC. ("SIMPLEHELIX"). We want to make your experience using our services and on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence. <br>
<br>
We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how SIMPLEHELIX collects information from all end users of SIMPLEHELIX's Internet services (the "Services") - those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who pay a service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Customers") - what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Customers have concerning the collection and use of such information. SIMPLEHELIX requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. <o:p></o:p></p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Introduction</strong>. SIMPLEHELIX      collects information in different ways from Visitors and Customers who      access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites      accessible through our Services. We use this information primarily to      provide a customized experience as you use our Services and, generally, do      not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose      personal information collected if we have received your permission      beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that      such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Registration</strong>.      Customers are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign      up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, billing      information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal      computer being used to access the Services. The personal information      collected from Customers during the registration process is used to manage      each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is      not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in      special circumstances. However, in instances where SIMPLEHELIX and a      partner jointly promote the Services, SIMPLEHELIX may provide the partner      certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of      persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion      for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results      of the promotion. In this instance, personal information may not be used      by the partner for any other purpose. SIMPLEHELIX may also generate      non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Customers      provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names,      of Customers). As explained in more detail below, we may use this      aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that      appear on the Services.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Domain Registration</strong>.      Domain name registration information legally has to be available to the      public. Since domain name registration information is available to the      public, anyone can access it through "WHOIS" searches. The WHOIS      database is a publicly accessible database that lists the domain name and      contact information of each registrant. The domain name registration you      provide is hosted by us to the public. At times our customers may have      been included within searches of the WHOIS database. However, the SPAM      they receive does not in any way come from SIMPLEHELIX.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>SIMPLEHELIX Partners and      Sponsors</strong>. Some SIMPLEHELIX products and services are offered to      Visitors and Customers in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner. To      provide Visitors and Customers some of these products and services, the      partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these      instances, we will provide such data collected or transferred to our      Partners and Sponsors (e.g., domain registration). Additionally, many SIMPLEHELIX      Customers have co-branded pages that are co-sponsored by non-affiliated      partners. SIMPLEHELIX will share non-identifying and aggregate information      (except as described above), but not personal information, with such      partners in order to administer the co-branded products or services      offered.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Online Shopping</strong>. At      some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register to      receive materials, such as a catalog or new product and service updates.      In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as      your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card      information. If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online      gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide      information about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address,      and phone number. SIMPLEHELIX has no control over the third parties' use      of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please      exercise care when doing so. If you order products directly from SIMPLEHELIX,      we will use the personal information you provide only to process that      order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the      extent necessary to complete that order.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Online Advertisements</strong>.      SIMPLEHELIX displays our online advertisements. We share aggregated and      non-identifying information about our Visitors and Customers collected      through the registration process as well as through online surveys and      promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use      this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored      advertisements. For instance, an advertiser tells us the audience they      want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55 years of age) and      provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the      aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then      display the advertisement to the intended audience. SIMPLEHELIX does not      share personal information about its Visitors or Customers with these      advertisers.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Responses to Email      Inquiries</strong>. When Visitors or Customers send email inquiries to SIMPLEHELIX,      the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. SIMPLEHELIX      does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not      share the return email address with any third party.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Voluntary Customer Surveys</strong>.      We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys.      We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they      provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types      of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal      information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the      survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer      surveys is voluntary. We take the information we receive from individuals      responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the      responses of other SIMPLEHELIX customers to create broader, generic      responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence,      hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic      information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the      quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products.      This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with      third parties.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Special Cases</strong>. It is SIMPLEHELIX's      policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors of      Customers in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also      providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such      unrelated uses. However, SIMPLEHELIX may disclose personal information      about Visitors or Customers, or information regarding your use of the      Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if,      in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so,      including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy      Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information;      to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring      legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use      Policy or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to      protect SIMPLEHELIX and our Customers.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>"Cookies" and      How SIMPLEHELIX Uses Them</strong>. A "cookie" is a small data file      that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. SIMPLEHELIX      may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for      statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and      to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Member and have      created your own Personal Start Page, we will use a cookie to save your      settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. These      cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer      information. Additionally, be aware that if you visit non-SIMPLEHELIX Web      sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may      be required to accept cookies. Advertisers and partners may also use their      own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim      responsibility for information collected through them.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Statistics</strong>. We use      information gathered about you from our site statistics (for example your      IP address) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer      our Web site. We also gather broad demographic information from this data      to help us improve our site and make your browsing and purchasing      experience more enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally      identifiable information, except as necessary to prevent fraud or abuse on      our system.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>SIMPLEHELIX's Commitment      to Children's Privacy</strong>. Protecting children's privacy is especially      important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children's Online      Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws. While we      make every effort to ensure that these Web sites are fun and      age-appropriate for our younger audience, we believe that there is no      substitute for proper parental supervision. SIMPLEHELIX recommends that      children ask a parent for permission before sending personal information      to SIMPLEHELIX, or to anyone else online.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Public Forums</strong>. Please      remember that any information you may disclose in our Member Directory, or      other public areas of our Web sites or the Internet, becomes public      information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose      personal information in these public areas.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>SIMPLEHELIX's Commitment      to Data Security</strong>. Services and Web sites we sponsor have security      measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the      information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the      integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee      that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers"      from illegally obtaining this information.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>How to Access or Modify      Your Information</strong>. SIMPLEHELIX offers Customers the opportunity to      access or modify information provided during registration. To access or      modify such information contact our Customer Service Department at      billing@SIMPLEHELIX.com. <o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Where to Direct Questions      About SIMPLEHELIX's Privacy Policy</strong>. If you have any questions about      this Privacy Policy or the practices described herein, you may contact:      Customer Service, SIMPLEHELIX, INC., <st1:address w:st="on"><st1:street w:st="on">919 E.

    <li style="margin-bottom: 12pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Exceptions</strong>. As stated      previously in this policy, we will never give out your information without      your permission. The only exceptions to this are, when we are required by      law, in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to      conform to the law, or we must comply with a legal process served on our      web site. We may also need to give out your information if one of our      partners requires it, but these situations are rare and we will always ask      for your explicit permission first.<o:p></o:p></li>
    <li style="" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Revisions to This Policy</strong>.      SIMPLEHELIX reserves the right to revise, amend, or modify this policy,      our Internet Service Agreement and our other policies and agreements at      any time and in any manner. Notice of any revision, amendment, or      modification will be posted in accordance with the Internet Service      Agreement. <o:p></o:p></li>
