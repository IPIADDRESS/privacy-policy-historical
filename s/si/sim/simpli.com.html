      YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</span><br>
      Effective January 1, 2005, companies that collect personally

      a consumer, either (1) provide a list detailing the 
      categories of information shared and the entities to 
      which such information was provided or (2) provide a 
      mechanism by which a consumer may opt-out of having 
      their information shared with third parties. We have 
      elected the second option and you may request that your 
      P.I.I. not be shared with third parties (including affiliated 
      entities) by sending your request, including your full

    <p class="text">When you sign up for an advertiser or

      For publishers, we require a social security number 
      or a federal tax identification number so that we can

      this information for internal business purposes, such 
      as contacting our advertisers and publishers, charging 
      our advertiser’s credit cards as requested by 
      our advertisers, billing our advertisers, providing 
      assistance to advertisers and publishers in managing 
      their accounts, paying publishers, and otherwise serving 
      our clients in the normal course of our business. Also, 
      from time to time, we may communicate with you by email. 
      These email communications may be related to assisting 
      you with your account or providing you with information

    <p class="text"><span class="aboutsub">IV. INFORMATION 
      SHARING</span><br>
      ValueClick only shares personal information with other 
      companies or individuals outside of ValueClick in the 
      following limited circumstances:</p>
    <p class="text">We use third party vendors to help us 
      operate our business or administer activities on our 
      behalf. For example, we use a third party payment-processing 
      platform to provide us with the ability to accept credit 
      card payments from advertisers. We may share your information 
      with these third parties for the limited purpose of 
      providing us with these services. Each third-party vendor 
      with access to the personal information of our clients 
      has agreed to protect the confidentiality of information 
      provided by ValueClick.</p>
    <p class="text">We and/or our marketing partners may enhance 
      and/or merge P.I.I. with commercially available third 
      party data collected from other sources in an effort 
      to ensure that the messages being sent to the consumer 
      in online and/or offline marketing programs are relevant 
      to their interests. In the event we enhance and/or merge 
      such P.I.I. with data collected from other sources, 
      we will take reasonable steps to maintain the integrity 
      and quality of that information.</p>
    <p class="text">We may share P.I.I. (including information 
      that has been enhanced with information from other sources) 
      with co-branded partners, advertisers, third party marketers, 
      our affiliated entities for their online and/or offline 
      marketing programs. </p>
    <p class="text">We may share P.I.I. in connection with 
      the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, 
      transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation 
      of ValueClick or its affiliated entities. </p>
    <p class="text">We have a good faith belief that access, 
      use, preservation or disclosure of such information 
      is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable 
      law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental 
      request, (b) enforce applicable agreements that have 
      been entered into with us, including investigation of 
      potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or 
      otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, 
      or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, 
      property or safety of ValueClick, its users or the public 
      as required or permitted by law.</p>
    <p class="text">We share non-personally identifiable information 
      with affiliated entities in the normal course of our 
      business. Most of this information relates to the nature 
      of the searches and clicks that we receive on the Simpli 
      search engine, including, for example, the number of 
      queries, the keywords that are queried, the number of 
      clicks, the geographical origination of searches and 
      clicks, and the conversion rate of particular Simpli 
      publisher web sites. None of this information is used 
      to personally identify any users. </p>
    <p class="text"><span class="aboutsub">V. INFORMATION 
      SECURITY</span><br>
      We take appropriate, industry-standard security measures 
      to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized 
      alteration, disclosure or destruction of data and otherwise 
      protect your P.I.I. We restrict access to personal information 
      to ValueClick employees, contractors and agents who 
      need to know that information in order to operate, develop 
      or improve our services. These individuals are bound 
      by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to 
      discipline, including if they fail to meet these obligations.<br>
      No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed 
      to be completely secure. It may be possible for third 
      parties not under the control of ValueClick to intercept 
      or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. 
      While we strive to protect your PII, we cannot ensure 
      or warrant the security of any information you transmit 
      to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating 
      with us.</p>

      CHANGES</span><br>
      ValueClick may find it necessary or be legally obligated 
      to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When 
      we do, we will post those changes on this page and update 
      the effective date so that you are always aware of the 
      information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
      circumstances we disclose it. Except as otherwise required 
      by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy will not 
      affect the privacy of data collected by ValueClick prior 
      to the effective date of the policy change unless we 
      provide you direct notice and the opportunity to opt-out 
      of such proposed change.</p>
    <p class="text"><span class="aboutsub">VII. CHILDREN'S
