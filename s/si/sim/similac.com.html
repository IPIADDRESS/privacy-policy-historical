<h2>Abbott Nutrition Privacy Policy - US Residents only</h2><p>This Privacy Policy applies to residents of the United States. If you are a resident of another country, please <a data-gacategory="External-Link" data-gaaction="Privacy-Policy" data-galabel="Abbott Global Sites" href="http://www.abbott.com/global-sites.html" target="_blank">click here</a> for applicable information. This Privacy Policy explains how Abbott handles information that is collected from or about you or your device on websites and mobile applications controlled by Abbott Laboratories (including its subsidiaries and affiliates, in this case, Abbott Nutrition) which link to this Privacy Policy (referred to as “Abbott Nutrition Websites”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected from you offline, to Abbott websites that do not link to this Privacy Policy, to residents of countries other than the United States, or to third-party websites to which Abbott Nutrition Websites may link. Your use of Abbott Nutrition Websites which link to this Privacy Policy is subject to this Privacy Policy and the <a data-gacategory="External-Link" data-gaaction="Privacy-Policy" data-galabel="online-terms-and-conditions" href="http://www.abbott.com/online-terms-and-conditions.html" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.</p><p>Please read this Privacy Policy before using Abbott Nutrition Websites or submitting personal information to us.</p>                    <h2>How does this Privacy Policy define “personal information”?</h2>
 <p>“Personal information” means information that identifies you or could reasonably be used to identify you and which is submitted to and/or collected by Abbott Nutrition or its third-party partners. Examples of personal information include your name, your postal address and your telephone number. “Personal information” does not include information that is aggregated with other users’ information (other than members of your household) or is anonymized and not associated with you or your household, such as your device or usage information.</p>             <h2>What information does Abbott collect?</h2>
 <p>Abbott collects information in a few different ways:</p>  <p></p><ul><li><strong><em>Information You Submit or Give Us Permission to Obtain.</em></strong>
						 Abbott collects personal information that you enter into data fields on Abbott Nutrition Websites. This may include, for example, your name, postal address, e-mail address, and/or other personal information. If you’re accessing Abbott Websites on your mobile device, you may also choose to provide us with location data. To protect your privacy, you should not provide Abbott with any information that is not specifically requested.

						<br><br>
						
You may also give us permission to access certain personal information maintained by other service providers. For example, you may link your social media or Google account to Abbott, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (such as your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from these services often depends on your settings or the applicable provider's privacy policies, so please check these policies before granting us access. You agree that we are not responsible for any acts or omissions by these social media service providers. If you give us permission to access this information, we will use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
					</li><li style="list-style: none"><br></li><li><strong><em>Passive Collection of Information.</em></strong>
						 Abbott, its vendors and partners, may collect information about you without you actively submitting such information. Abbott does this on Abbott Nutrition Websites and in emails we or our third-party partners send you. Information may be collected automatically over time and across websites and devices using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags, pixels, and web beacons. This information can make your use of Abbott Nutrition Websites easier and more meaningful by allowing Abbott and our partners to provide better service, customize sites based on consumer preferences, compile statistics, provide you with more relevant advertisements based on your interests, analyze trends, and otherwise administer and improve Abbott Nutrition Websites. As discussed in the “How do Abbott and its partners use cookies for advertising?” section below, such information may also be collected by Abbott’s advertising vendors and other third-party partners. Here are some of the types of information collected when visiting Abbott Nutrition Websites:

						<ul><li><em><strong>Log data.</strong></em>
								 When you use Abbott Nutrition Websites, our servers automatically record information (“log data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit an Abbott Nutrition Website or your mobile app sends when you’re using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the webpages you visited that had Abbott Nutrition Website features, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used Abbott Nutrition Websites, and cookie data.
							</li><li><em><strong>Cookie data.</strong></em>
								 Depending on how you’re accessing Abbott Nutrition Websites, we and our approved third-party partners may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our sites, unique to your Abbott account or your browser) or similar technologies, to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you and/or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to remember your personal preferences, such as sections of that Website that you visit frequently, your user ID, or other settings so you don’t have to set them up every time you visit Abbott Nutrition Websites, and we may use cookies to serve you relevant advertising tailored to your interests. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Abbott account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not. Please see the “How do Abbott and its partners use cookies for advertising?” section below for more information.
							</li><li><em><strong>Social Media Plugins and Data.</strong></em>
								 In addition, Abbott Nutrition Websites may use social media plugins (e.g., the Facebook "Like" button, '"Share to Twitter"' button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit Abbott Nutrition Websites, the operator of the social plugin can place a cookie on your computer, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Abbott Nutrition Websites. If you are logged into the social media website (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google+) while browsing on Abbott Nutrition Websites, the social plugins allow that social media website to receive information that you have visited Abbott Nutrition Websites. The social plugins also allow the social media website to share information about your activities on Abbott Nutrition Websites with other users of their social media website. Abbott does not control any of the content from the social plugins. For more information about social plugins from other social media websites you should refer to those sites' privacy and data sharing statements.
							</li><li><em><strong>Device information.</strong></em>
								 In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you’re using to access Abbott Nutrition Websites, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device may make available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
							</li></ul></li><li><em><strong>Information Provided by Abbott Partners.</strong></em>
						 Third parties, such as our vendors and other business and service partners, may share with Abbott the information they collect about you. For example, our vendors may share information with us regarding Abbott ads on websites or applications where such ads run to measure and/or improve those ads. Abbott may receive this information, which may include information like whether clicks on ads led to purchases or a list of criteria to use in targeting ads. We may combine information we get from a third-party with information we already have, and we may combine information that we have collected offline with information we collect on Abbott Nutrition Websites.
					</li></ul><p></p>             <h2>HOW DOES ABBOTT USE YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
 <p></p><p>Abbott will use the personal information you provide through Abbott Nutrition Websites to respond to your questions and to provide you with efficient customer service.</p><p>Abbott may also use your information for other purposes, such as to:</p><ul><li>Provide our products and services to you and make them better, and to develop new products and services.</li><li>Send you notices and information regarding Abbott’s products or services, including notifying you about special promotions or offers.</li><li>Invite you to participate in surveys about our products or services.</li><li>Furnish and maintain Abbott Nutrition Websites.</li><li>Protect Abbott and our users.</li><li>Secure our network and Abbott Nutrition Websites.</li></ul><br><p>Abbott may also use information collected from you or about you to offer you customized content, including to:</p><ul><li>Recognize new or past visitors to Abbott Nutrition Websites.</li><li>Remember your personal preferences.</li><li>Show you more relevant and meaningful advertisements based on your interests.</li><li>Better understand the interests of our customers and visitors to Abbott Nutrition Websites.</li><li>Conduct research and analyze the use of our Abbott Nutrition Websites, products, services, and advertisements.</li></ul><p></p>  <p></p><p>Abbott may also use your information for other purposes disclosed to you from time to time.</p><p>In addition, some of our applications and mobile-optimized sites may have location-based features. To deliver these features, we may collect and use location data provided by your mobile device. For example, we may offer shopping features that allow you to get information about local merchants. By using such applications, you consent to the collection and use of your mobile device location data for purposes of delivering these location-based features.</p><p></p>             <h2>How do Abbott and its partners use cookies for advertising?</h2>
 <p>Abbott, its vendors and partners, use common tracking tools, such as cookies, pixels, web beacons, and similar technologies (discussed in the <em>“What information does Abbott collect online?”</em> section above), to automatically collect information about users for purposes of enhancing their online experience and delivering more meaningful advertisements. Like many companies, Abbott may also utilize third-party advertising vendors and other partners to collect this information.</p>  <p>One way in which we deliver more meaningful advertisements is through a common form of online advertising known as “retargeting” or “remarketing.” Retargeting works by serving ads on one site based on an individual’s online activities on a different, unrelated site. For example, if you look at Similac<sup>®</sup> products on an Abbott Nutrition Website, you may later see an advertisement for Similac<sup>®</sup> products when you visit third-party sites. To do this, Abbott or its advertising vendors may use a device ID, cookie, pixel, web beacon, or similar technology placed by Abbott or our third-party vendor when you visit Abbott Nutrition Websites or third-party websites or apps. The placing of these cookies or other technologies on your device may enable you to be identified across multiple websites. You should consult the privacy policies of our vendors and other websites that you visit to understand how they collect and use your data.</p>  <p>Your ability to control the use of tracking tools such as cookies and to opt-out of retargeting activities is described in the <em>“What choices do I have about how Abbott collects and uses information about me?”</em> section below.</p>             <h2>DOES ABBOTT COMBINE INFORMATION?</h2>
 <p>Abbott may combine the information we gather about you on one Abbott Nutrition Website with the information we gather about you on other Abbott Nutrition Websites. Abbott may also combine information we gather about you online with our offline records, as well as records provided by third parties. We use this consolidated information to help us better design Abbott websites and Abbott products, to communicate information to you, to enhance our marketing and research activities, to serve you more relevant advertising, for other purposes that we may disclose to you from time to time, and to facilitate the other business functions described in the <em>“In what circumstances might Abbott use information?”</em> section above.</p>             <h2>What choices do I have about how Abbott collects and uses information about me?</h2>
 <p>You may limit the amount and type of personal information that Abbott receives about you by choosing not to enter any personal information into forms or data fields on Abbott Nutrition Websites. Some of our online services can only be provided to you if you provide us with appropriate personal information. Other parts of Abbott Nutrition Websites may ask whether you wish to opt-out or opt into our contact lists for offers, promotions and additional services that may be of interest to you.</p>  <p>In addition, you can control the use of tracking tools and limit retargeting activities as follows:</p>  <p></p><ul><li><em><strong>Controlling Tracking Tools.</strong></em>
						 Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. You can also control Flash cookies which we may use on certain Abbott Nutrition Websites from time to time by clicking 
						<a data-gacategory="External-Link" data-gaaction="Privacy-Policy" data-galabel="macromedia.com" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">here</a>
						. Why? Because Flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.
					</li><li><strong><em>Opting-Out of Retargeting Activities.</em></strong>
						 The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded across time and across websites and used for online behavioral advertising purposes. Click

						 to opt-out of having your online behavior collected for advertising purposes and receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from our advertising partners. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific. Also, certain versions of the iOS operating system permit you to “

						 ” in the system settings. Options you select are browser and device specific.
					</li><li><em><strong>Abbott Do Not Track Policy.</strong></em>
						 Some browsers have Do Not Track (“DNT”) features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform, and some browsers may not be set up to honor such requests. Abbott honors the AdChoice DNT signals. Options you select are browser and device specific. Please be aware that limiting the ability of websites to set cookies, however, may worsen your overall user experience, and in some cases the sites will not work properly without cookies, local storage and similar technologies.
