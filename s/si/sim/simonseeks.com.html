<p><a href="#page-top">Skip to top</a></p>
<h2><a name="5"></a>5. Where We Store Your Personal Data</h2>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Website site; any transmission is at your own risk.

<p>We may provide your personal details to a third party for legal or regulatory reasons in order to comply with our legal obligations, or in order to enforce or apply our <a title="View terms of use" href="terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> or to protect the rights, property, or safety of simonseeks.com Limited, our customers, or others.

We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries.</p>
