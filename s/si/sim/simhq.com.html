                    <p class="subhead_red"><a name="history" id="history"></a>Site History</p>
                  <p class="bodytext_black">Since 
                    1997, SimHQ has existed to provide the 
                    simulation community with the best articles, news, message 
                    boards, and tips to make our common passion more enjoyable. 
                    What started out as one man’s personal website has quickly 
                    risen to become the community’s leader for sim information.</p>
                  <p class="bodytext_black">This didn’t happen by accident… 
                    it took dedicated volunteers, the support of our readers, 
                    and a continuing desire to be the best. Many of our writers not only have “been there 
                    and done that” around the world, but continue pushing 
                    the envelope today. They are our inspiration and our ‘reality 
                    check’ that we are, after all, gaming, but their deep 
                    knowledge of the topics they write about shines through in 
                    their articles.</p>
                  <p class="bodytext_black">Another ‘SimHQ difference’ 
                    is our technical knowledge. We’re all tinkerers…the 
                    kind of people who understand what makes our PCs tick, and 
                    who always seek to make our sims run the fastest, most stable, 
                    and with the highest quality that it can. Several of our staff 
                    either currently work for the world’s leading technology 
                    companies, or have in the past. We’re the best of both 
                    worlds…a site focused on simulations, but deeply interested 
                    in the hardware that makes it happen.</p>
                  <p class="bodytext_black">Many 
                    of us have written for other commercial or fan sites, and 
                    the experience hasn’t always been a good one. That desire 
                    to be accurate, truthful, and respectable comes through in 
                    any of our articles, and it’s the core of our <a href="#pledge" class="bodylink">Pledge 
                      to our Readers</a>. Check the pledge out, and think about 
                    it the next time you’re reading an article trying to 
                    decide whether to spend your hard-earned money on a software 
                    title or piece of hardware. We mean what we say, and for good 
                    reason.</p>
                  <p class="bodytext_black">If you’re a long-time SimHQ reader, 
                    you already know all of this, and hopefully have seen it in 
                    action. If you’re new to our site, welcome, and thanks 
                    for choosing us. Be sure to read our <a href="#faqs" class="bodylink">Frequently
