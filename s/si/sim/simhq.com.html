                <p class="subhead_red"><a name="history" id="history"></a>Site History</p>
                <p class="bodytext_black">Since 
                  1997, SimHQ has existed to provide the 
                  simulation community with the best articles, news, message 
                  boards, and tips to make our common passion more enjoyable. 
                  What started out as one man’s personal web site has quickly 
                  risen to become the community’s leader for sim information.</p>
                <p class="bodytext_black">This didn’t happen by accident… 
                  it took dedicated volunteers, the support of our readers, 
                  and a continuing desire to be the best. Many of our writers not only have “been there 
                  and done that” around the world, but continue pushing 
                  the envelope today. They are our inspiration and our ‘reality 
                  check’ that we are, after all, gaming, but their deep 
                  knowledge of the topics they write about shines through in 
                  their articles.</p>
                <p class="bodytext_black">Another ‘SimHQ difference’ 
                  is our technical knowledge. We’re all tinkerers…the 
                  kind of people who understand what makes our PCs tick, and 
                  who always seek to make our sims run the fastest, most stable, 
                  and with the highest quality that it can. Several of our staff 
                  either currently work for the world’s leading technology 
                  companies, or have in the past. We’re the best of both 
                  worlds…a site focused on simulations, but deeply interested 
                  in the hardware that makes it happen.</p>
                <p class="bodytext_black">Many 
                  of us have written for other commercial or fan sites, and 
                  the experience hasn’t always been a good one. That desire 
                  to be accurate, truthful, and respectable comes through in 
                  any of our articles, and it’s the core of our <a href="#pledge" class="bodylink">Pledge 
                    to our Readers</a>. Check the pledge out, and think about 
                  it the next time you’re reading an article trying to 
                  decide whether to spend your hard-earned money on a software 
                  title or piece of hardware. We mean what we say, and for good 
                  reason.</p>
                <p class="bodytext_black">If you’re a long-time SimHQ reader, 
                  you already know all of this, and hopefully have seen it in 
                  action. If you’re new to our site, welcome, and thanks 
                  for choosing us. Be sure to read our <a href="#faqs" class="bodylink">Frequently 
                    Asked Questions</a> (FAQ) page to learn more about the history 
                  and current operations of the site, and please drop us a line 
                  if you have any suggestions, comments, or questions!</p>

                    each month is well into the hundreds.</p>

                  <p class="bodytext_black">Nothing, except your time. :) SimHQ always has been and always will be 100% free. Some specific content is restricted to registered members to say thanks for registering on our web site.</p>

                <blockquote>
  <p class="bodytext_black">Right now, yes we do. </p>
  <p class="bodytext_black">Because SimHQ remains 100% free, the site depends 
                    primarily on advertising revenue to exist.</p>
  <p class="bodytext_black">We ask that you consider allowing our ads to run and not block them, and support our advertisers whenever you can. We make a big effort to try and provide advertising that we think our readers would be interested in, and while some non-sim ads display occasionally, we continue to make an on-going effort to tune, tweak and refine. Believe it, if we didn't need to run ads, we wouldn't. It is more work for us.</p>
