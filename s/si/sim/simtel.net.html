<p><em>Information You 

Volunteer.</em>&nbsp; We collect the personal information you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use this Website, for 

example, the information you 

provide when you request information about products or services.&nbsp; This information may include your name, street and email 

address, phone number, credit 

card information, and information used to verify your identity or to prevent fraud.&nbsp; </p> <p><em>Information Sent to Us by 

Your Web Browser.&nbsp; 

</em>We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser.&nbsp; This information typically includes your 

IP address, the address of 

the web page you were visiting when you accessed this Website, the name of your operating system (such as Windows<sup>®</sup> 

or 

Macintosh<sup>®</sup>), the name and version of your browser (such as Netscape<sup>®</sup> or Internet 

Explorer<sup>®</sup>), and the date and 

time of your visit.&nbsp; The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser.&nbsp; Please check your browser 

if you want to learn what 

information your browser sends or how to change your settings.&nbsp; </p> <p>The information provided by your browser does not 

identify you personally.&nbsp; 

We use this non-personal information primarily to create statistics that help us improve the Digital River Websites and make them 

more compatible with the 

technology used by our visitors.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this Website, 

we may link the information 

provided by your browser to information that identifies you personally and use it for the purposes described below.&nbsp; In 

addition, we may review our 

server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network.&nbsp; If we suspect criminal activity, we might 

share our server logs -- 

which contain visitors’ IP addresses -- with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to 

trace and identify 

individuals. </p> <p><em>Information Collected Using “Cookies” and Other Web Technologies.</em>&nbsp; We use 

“cookies,” and similar 

technologies, such as Web Beacons (also referred to as “tracking pixels,” or “action tags”), to collect 

personal information and 

support the functionality of this Website.&nbsp; For more information about our use of cookies and Web Beacons, see below.</p> 

<p><strong>Cookies and Web 

Beacons</strong></p> <p><em>Cookies and Web Beacons</em>.&nbsp; A “cookie” is a small text file that is transferred to 

your computer by our Web 

server.&nbsp; We may use two types of cookies -- “session cookies” and “persistent cookies.” </p> 

<p><em>Session Cookies</em>.&nbsp; 

A “session cookie” is a temporary cookie that expires when you close your browser.&nbsp; A session cookie assigns a 

randomly-generated, unique 

identification number to your computer when you access one of our Sites.&nbsp; Assigning your computer a number facilitates the 

proper functioning of the 

features of our Websites, by permitting us to maintain a persistent “state” for your session, such as, maintaining the 

contents of your shopping 

basket during checkout.&nbsp; We also use session cookies to collect information about the ways visitors use this Website – 

which pages they visit, 

which links they use, and how long they stay on each page.&nbsp; We analyze this information (known as “click-stream 

information”) to better 

understand our visitors’ interests and needs and to improve the content and functionality of this Website.&nbsp; </p> 

<p>Sessions cookies do not 

contain your personal information.&nbsp; If, however, you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this Website, we 

may link the session cookie 

identification number to information that identifies you personally.</p> <p><em>Persistent Cookies.</em>&nbsp; When you visit this 

Website, we may place one 

or more “persistent cookies” on your computer.&nbsp; Unlike a “session cookie,” a persistent cookie does 

not expire when you close 

your browser.&nbsp; It stays on your computer until it expires (for example, at the end of the calendar year) or until you delete 

it.&nbsp; </p> <p>Some 

persistent cookies simply “tag” your computer so that the next time you visit (or someone using your computer visits), 

our server will recognize 

you, not by name, but by the “tag” on your computer.&nbsp; This will enable us to provide you with a personalized 

experience even if we do not 

know who you are.&nbsp; It will also allow us to collect more accurate information about the ways people use this Website, for 

example, how people use this 

Website on their first visit and how often they return.&nbsp; If, at some point, you create a user identity, we may link the 

information collected by these 

persistent cookies to information in our database that identifies you personally.&nbsp; We may also transfer this information to a 

cookie and place it on 

your computer’s hard drive so that our web server can read this information each time you visit this Website.&nbsp; In 

either case, using persistent 

cookies permits us to provide you with a more personalized shopping experience and, in some cases, may save you the trouble of 

re-entering information 

already in our database.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or 

to alert you when a cookie 

is placed on your computer.&nbsp; You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave our Website.&nbsp; Although you are not 

required to accept our 

cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this 

Website.&nbsp; For example, you 

will not be able to purchase products and services on this Website.</p> <p><em>Web Beacons</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Web beacons (also 

referred to as “tracking 

pixels” or “action tags”) are graphic images, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, placed at various 

locations on our Site.&nbsp; Web 

beacons help us recognize the cookies on your browser.&nbsp; Like cookies, Web beacons help us collect information about the ways 

visitors use our 

Sites.&nbsp; They also help us identify browser types, IP addresses, search terms that bring visitors to our Sites, and the domain 

names of the Web sites 

that refer traffic to us.&nbsp; The information collected by Web beacons does not identify you personally.&nbsp; However, if you 

have created a user identity 

on one of your visits to this Website, for example, by making a purchase, we may link the information we collect using Web beacons 

to the information that 

identifies you personally and use it in the same ways as we use the information we collect using cookies.&nbsp; Lastly, we utilize 

web beacons to provide us 

with more information on any emails we send out, in particular, the web beacons will send us information to let us know that you 

have received and opened any 

email you have chosen to receive from us.</p> <p><a name="use_of_info"></a><strong>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?

Crimes, and Protect Legal 

Rights, Property, You and Others.&nbsp; </em>There are other limited circumstances in which we may share the personal information

when we, in good faith, 

believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a regulatory requirement; to comply with a subpoena or court order; to 

cooperate with law 

enforcement or other governmental investigations (without necessarily requiring the law enforcement or government agency 

requesting the information to 

formally serve us with a subpoena); to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce a 

contract; to protect the legal 

rights, property or safety of Digital River, our affiliates, our employees, agents, other users or the public in general or to 

protect your vital 

interests.&nbsp; We also reserve the right to report to appropriate law enforcement or government agencies any activities that we, 

in good faith, believe to 

be unlawful without providing notice to you.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> <em>In Connection With Corporate Events</em>.&nbsp; We may

any applicable Privacy Notices, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.&nbsp; </p> <p><a name="your_choices"></a><strong>Your
