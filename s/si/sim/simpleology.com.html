    What Information Is Collected And How Is It Used?</b></p>
    <p>Information 
    is collected from users in the following areas of this site:</p>
    
    <p>Registration</p><p><b>:
    </b>Information is collected from members when they register for Simpleology. 
    In order to create a membership account with us, members are required to 
    provide their first and last name, their email address, and country and 
    postal code. This information is used to:</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    (a) 
    verify the legitimacy of the registration (for more information, 
    please see “Communications From This Site” below); and</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    (b) 
    identify the member when they log into the Simpleology Control Panel 
    (where the courses are located), and to customize their experience based on 
    what courses they have purchased; and</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    (c) geographical information is collected for our own research purposes 
    and is not connected to member’s Personally Identifiable Information 
    following its collection.</p>
    
    <p>2. 
    Upon registration, members also have the option to subscribe to receive 
    newsletters and communications from <a style="color: blue;" href="http://www.simpleology.com">www.simpleology.com</a>. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="color: blue">
    <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.simpleology.com">www.simpleology.com</a></span></p><p> 
    runs two mailing lists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
    Simpleology 
    Weekly – our main list to inform members of important events and service 
    announcements; and <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
    Simpleology 
    Daily - a daily service of reminders and motivational information.<p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>3. <b>Support Desk: </b>Information such as name and email address is required 
    when members submit a ticket to our support desk. This information is 
    required so that the customer care team may respond to that query, and the 
    member may track the progress of their complaint online. The information 
    collected is used solely for purpose of resolving the member’s complaint or 
    query. </p>

    <p>3. <b>Refer-a-Friend: </b>When new members register for Simpleology, we present 
    them with the option of selecting to tell two friends about Simpleology 
    also. If the new member elects to use the Refer-a-Friend service for passing 
    on information about our web site to a friend, we ask the referrer for their 
    friend’s first name and email address for the purpose of sending the friend 
    a one-time email containing a link to our web site. The communication sent 
    via the new member includes an explanation of how the friend came to receive 
    the email and a link to our support desk if they have any concerns. Mark 
    Joyner, Inc stores the information collected via this tool on a log file, 
    but does not use it for any purpose other than to send this one-time email.
    </p>

    <p>4. <b>Discussion Community: </b><a href="http://www.simpleology.com">
    www.simpleology.com</a> runs a Discussion Community. Simpleology members 
    gain instant access to the Community upon registration and may use their 
    Simpleology login details to log into the forum. However, actual 
    participation in the Discussion Community is voluntary.<br>
    <br>
    Members may request to be informed of new posts in a forum thread. 
    Notifications of new posts are delivered by email to the email address 
    provided by the member upon their Simpleology registration. An unsubscribe 
    function is included in this communication in the event the member decides 
    they do not wish to receive such notifications any longer. Forum members may 
    also unsubscribe from threads by using the tools located in their community 
    user profile. To find out more about how to update/correct community profile 
    information, please see ‘Correcting/Updating Information’ section below.</p>
    <p>5. <b>Testimonial Form: </b>Mark Joyner, Inc invites all members to post a 
    testimonial about Simpleology using our Testimonial Form located here:
    </p>

    <p>
    <a style="color:blue;" href="http://www.simpleology.com/testimonials.html">http://www.simpleology.com/testimonials.html</a> </p>

    <p>Personally 
    identifiable information submitted by members via the testimonial form may 
    include: name, website address, phone number and contact information, and 
    any pictures of the member that the member wishes to add. </p>
    <p>The 
    information provided in this form is completely voluntary and at the 
    discretion of the member. When submitting personally identifiable 
    information via a testimonial, members should be aware that their 
    information may be published by Mark Joyner, Inc or used in our marketing, 
    and that such information may be read, collected, or used by other 
    Simpleology members or members of the public. Simpleology is not responsible

    <p>We use an 
    independent service provider to record and store member testimonials called
    InstantAudio.com. For more 
    information, please see “Service Providers” for more information.</p>
    <p><b>
    Communications From This Site</b></p>
    
    <p>Once the 
    registration form is completed, the new member is sent a verification email 
    requesting them to confirm their registration. If this verification process 
    is not completed, the Simpleology membership account is not created and the 
    verification link expires and their personal information is discarded from 
    our database after one day</p>
    
    <p>Once the 
    verification process is successfully completed, the new member receives a 
    welcoming email which confirms their membership login details, and supplies 
    a link to the Control Panel and to our support desk.</p>
    
    <p>For 
    every requested communication sent to members (as detailed in 2 above), we 
    include an explanation of how the member came to be on that the mailing list 
    and present an unsubscribe option.</p>
    
	<p><b>Service Announcements</b></p>
    
    <p>On rare 
    occasions it may be necessary to send out a service-related announcement. 
    For instance, if the website is temporarily unavailable or undergoing 
    maintenance, we might send members an email. Members may not opt-out of 
    receiving these specific kinds of communications, but they are not 
    promotional in nature.</p>

    <p>This 
    information is logged beside your account profile in our system and stored 
    for 14 days, after which it is then discarded from our system. It is 
    therefore is linked to your personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
    
    <p>A cookie is 
    a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping 
    purposes. It allows information entered in one webpage to be “remembered” 
    when you enter a new webpage.</p>
    
    <p>We use both 
    session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when 
    you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for 
    an extended period of time.</p>
    
	<p>We use 
    session cookies to remember login information entered in our Control Panel 
    area and our Support Suite as you click through our web pages. The session 
    cookie will expire once you logout. If you voluntarily select for our system 
    to “remember” you next time you login, we will set a persistent cookie on 
    your machine in place of the usual session cookie, and this cookie will 
    store your login information and recall it next time you login.</p>
    
	<p>For 
    the <b>Control Panel</b>, the persistent cookie simply recalls your login 
    information (i.e. your username and password) and is not linked to your 
    personally identifiable information.</p>
    
	<p>In the <b>Support Suite</b>, your email address is used to form the username part of your 
    Support Suite login, therefore both the session and persistent cookies in 
    this section are linked to that personally identifiable information.</p>
    
	<p>On the <b>Discussion Community</b>, 
    persistent cookies are used to enable functions such as showing whether or 
    not a thread or forum you are viewing has received new posts since your last 
    visit, or to automatically log you back in when you return to the site after 
    being away for a while. When you register, you are provided with the option 
    to 'Automatically login when you return to the site'. This will store your 
    username and password in a cookie, stored on your computer. If you are using 
    a shared computer, such as in a library, school or internet cafe, or if you 
    have reason to not trust any other users that might use this computer, we do 
    not recommend that you enable this.</p>
    
	<p>The Discussion Community also 
    gives you the option to use a session ID cookie to track your current 
    session, ensuring that you remain logged-on while browsing the site. If you 
    choose not to store this information in a cookie, the session data will be 
    sent through each link you click. Choosing not to use a cookie may cause 
    problems if your computer's connection to the Internet uses a proxy-server 
    and you share links with other users behind the same proxy.</p>
    
	<p>Information about how to clear 
    your forum cookies can be found

    <p>If you 
    reject cookies, your ability to use our site will be limited. If your system 
    does not allow cookies for example, you will find that every time you access 
    a new webpage inside our Control Panel, you will be prompted to login again.<br><br>
    Some of our
