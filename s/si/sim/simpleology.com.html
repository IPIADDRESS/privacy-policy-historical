small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. 
It allows information entered in one webpage to be “remembered” when you enter a 
new webpage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-NZ" style="font-size: 11.0pt">We use both 
session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you 
close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an 
extended period of time. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">We use session cookies to 
remember login information entered in our WebCockpit and DesktopCockpit<b> </b>
areas, and our Support Suite as you click through our web pages. The session 
cookie will expire once you logout. If you voluntarily select for our system to 
“remember” you next time you login, we will set a persistent cookie on your 
machine in place of the usual session cookie, and this cookie will store your 
login information and recall it next time you login.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">For the WebCockpit and 
DesktopCockpit, the persistent cookie simply recalls your login information 
(i.e. your username and password) and is not linked to your personally

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">In the Support Suite, your 
email address is used to form the username part of your Support Suite login,
