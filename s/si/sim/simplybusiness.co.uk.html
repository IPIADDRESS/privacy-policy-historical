								<h1>Our Privacy Policy - what we will and won't do with your personal information</h1>
								<p><strong><br> </strong></p>





								





	



						
							<h2>We are an online company and trade with regard to specific data legislation.</h2>
						
						<p><strong>Please read this privacy policy with the Data Protection Act 1998.</strong></p> <p>We are registered with Data Protection Commissioner and our registration number is Z6948126.</p>


	



						
							<h2>The personal information we collect</h2>
						
						<p>If you fill in one of the Request for Quotes (RFQ) on our Site you  provide personal information to us. The purpose of our site is to  provide you with as wide a range of quotations from different Partner  organisations. In order to do this we will pass the data you have  provided to our Partners.</p> <p>In addition, we enable you to return to  the Site at any time to retrieve past quotes from Partners and, in the  case of insurance policies, to download your policies and associated  documentation. In order to provide this service, and keep it secure, we  ask you to register with us. We store your personal information, along  with information on any quotes you've received, on our servers.</p> <p>We  have kept to a minimum the amount of "required" information you need to  provide us across our Site. If you do not want to provide us with  certain information it may therefore be impossible for us to provide all  aspects of our service to you<em>&nbsp;</em></p>


	



						
						<p><em><strong>We ask you for information to assess your insurance needs.   This information is then used to give you a quote. Without this   information it is hard to give you an accurate quote.</strong></em></p>


	



						
							<h2>The anonymous information we collect</h2>
						
						<p>We also collect information from across our Site. This enables us to see  how people use our Site, and helps us in continually refining and  enhancing our service. We may also use aggregated customer information  to provide potential Partners with a general profile of people using our  Site, and to analyse the effectiveness of our service to customers.  None of this information can be related back to you as an individual.</p> <p><em><strong>We also take information like how long youâ€™ve been on the  site and which pages you've visited. This helps us to improve the services we provide to our customers.</strong></em></p>


	



						
							<h2>How we use cookies</h2>
						
						<p>The Site uses cookies to keep track of your identity and selections.  Cookies may be used to deliver content specific to your interests and  for other purposes. Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies. If you  want to know how to do this please look at the help menu on your  browser. However, switching off cookies will restrict your use of the  Site.<br> Please note - We require "cookies" to be enabled for you to  receive a quotation for insurance and for You to access and view your  insurance policy.</p> <p><em><strong>Not quite biscuits but small pieces of data that can  identify your computer to us. Please note that new laws about cookies  come into force in May 2012.</strong></em></p>


	



						
							<h2>What information we pass to other people and why</h2>
						
						<p>The success of the Site is based on us finding companies that can  meet your financial needs. To do this we need to share the information  you provide to us as part of the RFQ process on the Site. We therefore  may disclose your information to third parties participating in the Site  who wish to provide you with quotes for products or services directly  related to a request you have submitted on the Site. We will also  disclose your information to any successors in title to our business and  to suppliers we engage to process data on our behalf. We will also use  information internally in the administration of this Site. We may also  provide marketing information to Partners who have introduced your  enquiry to us.</p> <p>The financial information you provide as part of  the Needs Assessment Process on the Site is used by us and our Partners  to check your suitability for certain finance and insurance products. It  may be necessary for us to verify certain types of financial  information before processing your request or order. We will not share  your financial information with any other parties unless they need to  know the information to process your order.</p> <p>We will not, without  permission, willfully disclose a participant's financial information to  any third party except as provided herein, or when we believe in good  faith that it is required by law or regulation (including any consumer  credit or Financial Services Authority rules).</p> <p>Whilst we only  seek to work with trustworthy Partners with robust data protection  policies, we cannot guarantee the way in which our Partners will use  your information. The information provided to our Partners will be used  by them in accordance with their own privacy policies, which may differ  from ours but they are also under an obligation to process personal data  in accordance with the Data Protection Act of 1998.</p> <p><em><strong>We share some of your information with our insurers. We  have contracts in place with each of them, as required by our regulator the FSA. <br> </strong></em></p>
