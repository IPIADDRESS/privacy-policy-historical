            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Simplifi Holdings, Inc. ("Simpli.fi") is a company based in Fort Worth, Texas that provides online advertising services. This Privacy Policy describes our company's overall privacy practices as they pertain to the advertising services that we provide, and to visitors to our web site (www.simpli.fi).</p>
            <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
            <ul class="identifiable-info">
              <li>
                <h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
                <p>In performing our advertising services, we collect non-personally identifiable consumer information in multiple ways, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>on our own web sites</li>
                  <li>on the web sites of publishers that call our pixels (or "beacons")</li>
                  <li>when we serve online advertisements, and</li>
                  <li>from third party providers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  This anonymous data includes, but is not limited to, information such as a web visitor's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web visitor, date and time, domain type, and responses by a web visitor to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. As the Internet evolves, we may use different types of technologies to collect these types of anonymous, non-personally identifiable information. The collection of this anonymous data allows us and our advertisers to better target advertising to user interests. The data also allows us provide improvements to our services, for example, improving the effectiveness of the advertisements delivered to users and limiting the number of times a person sees a given advertisement. If you do not want us to collect or store anonymous data that relates to your use of the Internet, please click here:
                  <a href="/opt-out">Opt-Out</a>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h3>
                <p>It is our policy not to collect or store personally identifiable information for the purposes of targeting ads to users.</p>
                <p>However, we do collect personally identifiable information if that information is necessary to provide a specific service requested by a user (e.g., an address or email so that we can respond to a request for information from that user, billing information so that we may invoice a customer for our services, etc.). If in the future we start to collect PII for advertising purposes, we will make changes to this Privacy Policy to address its protection.</p>
                <p>Please note that at some of Simpli.fi's partner or advertiser properties, users may be asked to register and provide personally identifiable data. Although Simpli.fi is committed to making sure that our partners provide notice and choice to all consumers, the collection and use of such PII is controlled by the policies found on those sites. Since Simpli.fi cannot control those third party sites, we recommend that you to take appropriate steps to control the use of PII on third party sites.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How Do We Use the Information?</h2>
            <p>Simpli.fi use non-personally identifiable information to improve advertisement targeting, make and create offers, provide reporting to advertisers and clients, and to improve our advertising systems and products.

We may also share non-personally identifiable information with our subsidiaries and third party partners and agents for similar use.</p>
            <p>Simpli.fi may also disclose any information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Simpli.fi; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Simpli.fi; (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Simpli.fi, its websites or the public; or (4) to provide updates and services that may be of interest to the customer.</p>
