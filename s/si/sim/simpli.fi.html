            <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
            <ul class="privacy-info">
              <li>
                <h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
                <h4>Cookies</h4>
                <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don't have to enter it more than once. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
                <p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.</p>
                <h4>Third Party Cookies</h4>
                <p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company or service providers is not covered by our privacy statement.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.</p>
                <h4>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h4>
                <p>We employ, and our third party analytics partners, employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
                <p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Correspondence."</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h3>
                <p>We collect personally identifiable information if that information is necessary to provide a specific service requested by a user (e.g., name, phone number, an address or email so that we can respond to a request for information from that user, billing information so that we may invoice a customer for our services, etc.).</p>
                <p>Please note that at some of Simpli.fi's partner or advertiser properties, users may be asked to register and provide personally identifiable data. Although Simpli.fi is committed to making sure that our partners provide notice and choice to all consumers, the collection and use of such PII is controlled by the policies found on those sites. Since Simpli.fi cannot control those third party sites, we recommend that you to take appropriate steps to control the use of PII on third party sites.</p>
