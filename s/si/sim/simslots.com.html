<font size="5" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Privacy Policy</b></font><br><br>
<b>General Information</b><br>
At FreeSlots we respect the privacy of our users. Here you will find details on our privacy policy.<br>
<br>
FreeSlots provides online information and services related to gaming and any other subjects considered to be of interest to its audience. The term "FreeSlots" refers to any and all pages located on all sections of the FreeSlots and FreeVideoPoker web sites (http://www.freeslots.com and http://www.freevideopoker.com).<br>
<br>
<b>Standard User Data</b><br>
The standard data we collect about our users is not personally identifiable information. This means it is not information which identifies them as an individual. By using any of FreeSlots' services or reading its content, you agree that you understand the nature of this data collection.<br>
<br>
When you log onto FreeSlots, certain standard information is normally collected by our servers. This information may include, but may not be limited to, the location or web site from which you came; the time you spend on parts of FreeSlots or its related sites; the operating system you use on your computer (for example, Microsoft Windows 98); the software you use to browse the Internet (for example Microsoft Internet Explorer); the amount of information you access from FreeSlots; the advertisements you click on; your geographical location (specific only to country and/or state); the account from which you are accessing the Internet and subsequently FreeSlots; and your IP address. This data collection is standard and common to most web sites on the Internet.<br>
<br>
This information does not identify you as an individual, and none of this information will be disclosed in any form that is specific to you as a user of FreeSlots, unless otherwise stated. FreeSlots may use this information to generate aggregate statistics and demographic data about our user community or for security purposes, and may provide such information to advertisers and/or other partners.<br>
<br>
<b>Personal User Data</b><br>
The only ways in which FreeSlots may receive personally identifiable information about you is if you knowingly and willingly provide the information through our online entry forms, including, but not limited to, monthly contests and promotions. In such areas, the information you disclose is done so knowingly and willingly, and at your sole discretion. Personal information collected may include your name, home address, phone number, e-mail address, age, gender and/or birth date. We do not require this information to gain access to our site, however, you will not be able to access certain areas which require registration, be eligible for sweepstakes drawings, or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.<br>
<br>
Users may provide personally identifiable information, knowingly and of their own accord. The personal information you provide FreeSlots will allow us to alert you of new features, or enhancements, and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, contests, prize fulfillment, or special events. FreeSlots may enhance or merge the personal information collected at FreeSlots with data from third parties. FreeSlots may also provide your personal information to other companies or organizations which offer products or services which may be of interest to you. In such cases, we will notify you that the information will be shared and provide you with an opportunity to opt-out.<br>
<br>
FreeSlots may disclose your personal information to third party vendors to fulfill prizes, to process our newsletters or e-mail campaigns, or to analyze and/or store data. In special circumstances, we may also disclose such information if there is a violation of our Terms of Service or Use Agreements or if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process.<br>
<br>
Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as FreeSlots.<br>
<br>
<b>Protection</b><br>
No computer system is one hundred per cent protected, and although the means through which data is submitted to FreeSlots are reasonably safe, we cannot guarantee that data will not be unlawfully retrieved by third parties. When data is submitted to FreeSlots, it may come via a number of networks and/or machines, and although we use our best endeavors to make sure that the data is not intercepted, we cannot guarantee that this will be the case.<br>
<br>
<b>Opting Out</b><br>
From time to time, FreeSlots may send information to its users on various subjects including, but not limited to, contests, promotions, and announcements of new services or features. Users who sign up for these e-mails by completing a sweepstakes entry form always have the choice to opt out from such opportunities by sending e-mail from the address they signed up with to newgames@freeslots.com with the word "Remove" in the subject line. Alternatively, remove requests containing the specific e-mail address and all pertinent information may be submitted to: FreeSlots Remove Request, PMB 234, 370 N. East Camano Dr STE 5, Camano Island WA 98282-7279.<br>
<br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
Parts of FreeSlots use cookies to better provide our services and information. On the Internet, a "cookie" is a file that a website transfers to the user's computer for record-keeping purposes. This is a common feature of many websites on the Internet and is employed by FreeSlots to maintain unique information and user preferences, including but not limited to, credit and sweepstakes information.<br>
<br>
<b>Children</b><br>
Although the main demographic of FreeSlots does not encompass children below the age of 18, we welcome users of all ages to our content and services. If you are under the age of 13, we do, however, specifically request that you have the permission of your parents or legal guardian to view any content at FreeSlots and to take part in any and all services we offer.<br>
<br>
<b>Notes to Parents</b><br>
Users under the age of 18 are ineligible to enter contests or drawings on FreeSlots, and should therefore have no cause to provide personal information. If, however, such information is provided, parents who wish to have their child's name removed from any and/or all FreeSlots services may send a letter specifically stating that request to: FreeSlots Privacy Policy, PMB 234, 370 N. East Camano Dr STE 5, Camano Island WA 98282-7279. The request must contain all pertinent information including the name and e-mail address of the account in question.<br>
<br>
By using the FreeSlots Web site listed herein, you signify your assent to the FreeSlots Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this site. The Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.<br>
