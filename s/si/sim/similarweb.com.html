    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We respect your privacy because we treasure ours</p>
<p>We here at SimilarWeb treasure our privacy and that’s exactly why we made every effort to create a service that would live up to user privacy standards we would be comfortable with. </p>
<h2>User Consent</h2>
<p>When you use this site and its services you consent to collection, use and disclosure of your information as described in this privacy statement.
SimilarWeb LTD, (“SimilarWeb”, “We” or “Us”) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by SimilarWeb when you make use of the SimilarWeb site, sidebar and related services (the “Service” or "Sidebar") and how the information will be used. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. 
This Policy may be updated from time to time and therefore we ask you to check back periodically the most updated form of Policy as indicated below. Your continued use of the Products and this Site after this Policy has been amended and the "Last Updated" date has been modified, shall be deemed to be your continued acceptance of the terms of this Policy, as amended. </p>
<h2>Information that we collect</h2>
<p>Information collected online can generally be categorized as either non-personal information or personally identifiable information. Non-personal information is information that cannot by itself be traced back to a specific individual. For example, we know how many search queries we receive each day but we do not know the names and email addresses of the persons submitting the queries. 
We respect and protect the privacy of our users and take appropriate steps to safeguard your personal information. The use of this website and its related software, upgrades or updates and all related services and special offers (the "Product") are subject to the here under provisions of this Policy. </p>
<h2>Information you give us</h2>
<p>Currently, we don’t ask you to register for SimilarWeb because we simply don’t need you to. When you send email or make a vote in our Sidebar, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</p>
<h2>Automatic Tracking</h2>
<p>Our server automatically collects additional information about your use of our website (navigational data). Navigational data includes the type of browser you are using, your IP address, the URL you have come from and the time spent at that URL, cookies and your domain type and server. This kind of information is collected by many sites and used to monitor use of the relevant site. 
If you use our Sidebar, it will contact our servers periodically or in response to certain actions you take in your browser. Each of those contacts generates the same kind of information generated when you visit our website, as described above. Additionally, the Sidebar will transmit whatever data is necessary to provide particular features of the Sidebar and to monitor their use. 
Our Sidebar will be able to and may track certain information including online navigational information about you and your correspondence in order to perform internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior. This non-personal information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. Non-personally identifiable information may be analyzed by us for the purpose of improving and expanding the functionality of our Product. In addition, the Product checks regularly for product update on our servers and download such updates when needed. </p>
<h2>Disclosure of Users’ Data to Third Parties</h2>

Otherwise, we do not disclose personal information, such as your email address, unless we are required to do so by law, regulation, an applicable industry code, for safety reasons or where we reasonably believe that you are in breach of the terms and conditions of use of the Site or are engaged in illegal activities.</p>
<h2>Links and Displayed Sites</h2>
<p>As part of our core functionality, the Product may discover and recommend content that the Product determines may be of interest to you. We do not have control over third-party websites or their information collection practices and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such linked or otherwise displayed sites.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Information in the Event of a Merge</h2>
<p>We may merge or be acquired by another business entity or may sell all or substantially all of our assets to an acquirer. In the event of such merger, acquisition or sale, We may share some or all or your personally identifiable information with the acquiring company in order to continue serving you. In such event and if applicable, We will provide notice that such information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </p>
