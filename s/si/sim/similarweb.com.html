                Personal Information</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, we do not ask you to register for our products because we simply do not
                need you to. We do not require the submission of any information that identifies
                you personally, such as your name, address and other ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>").
                However, when you commence direct communications with us, we may retain such communications
                and the accompanying Personal Information in order to process your inquiries, respond
                to your requests and improve our services.</p>
            <h3>
                Statistical Information</h3>
            <p>
                We collect and aggregate non-identifying information regarding users use of our
                Products, including, inter alia, advertisements viewed, pages browsed, search inquiries,
                offers and services that interest you, the type of browser you are using, your IP
                address, the URL you have come from and the time spent at that URL, cookies and
                your domain type and server ("<strong>Statistical Information</strong>").</p>
            <h3>
                Browsing History and IP</h3>
            <p>
                In order to facilitate, improve, refine, personalize and match the identification
                and presentation of our products and SimilarWeb.com results to your browsing preferences
                and habits, we collect information regarding your use of our Product including URL
                and Statistical Information of websites you may be browsing while Product is installed
                ("<strong>Browsing History</strong>" and together with the Statistical Information
                "<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>").
            </p>
            <p>
                While we would never collect any Personal Information submitted to such websites,
                note that Browsing History is aggregated separately for each specific IP, in order
                to continuously improve our products and provide the most relevant accurate technology and data
                results for each different location to better understand Internet trends statistics.</p>
            <p>
                That said, IP addresses, while identifying a device connected to the Internet, and
                its general location, are in themselves anonymous and contain no information regarding
                the identity of the ultimate person using the device â€“ such identity is known solely
                to your ISP.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, IP addresses assigned by ISPs are generally dynamic and subject to frequent
                change â€“ static IP addresses are generally assigned only at subscriber's specific
                request and frequently require an additional fee.</p>
