  <h2>Cookies</h2>

  <p>We may use small text files called cookies to improve overall Site experience.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.  Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you.  Some advertisements that appear on this Site are delivered to you by our advertising partners.  Our advertising partners may download cookies to your computer.  Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement.  In this way, they may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked.  This information allows an advertising network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.  We do not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers.</p>

  <p>Our Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, IP addresses, External Web Sites (defined below) linked to, search terms and the domain names of our users' Internet Service Providers, and we may analyze these data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information.  We also may collect aggregate labor statistics from public records.  Such aggregate information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.  We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer our Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  We may share this aggregate information with third parties, including for various reasons related to our business to assist them in targeting advertisements to appropriate audiences.</p>
