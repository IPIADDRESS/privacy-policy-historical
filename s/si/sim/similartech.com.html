				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>
					SimilarTech Ltd. and SimilarTech Inc. (collectively "<b>SimilarTech</b>" or "<b>Company</b>" or "<b>we</b>"
					or "<b>us</b>" or "<b>our</b>") is the sole owner of an analysis tool which enables its business
					partners or potential clients to receive insights (i.e., market research, trends, leads, etc.) to
					leverage and grow their businesses ("<b>Platform</b>"). SimilarTech interacts with current and
					prospective clients and the general public via its Website, available at: <a href="/">https://www.similartech.com</a>
					("<b>Website</b>") or Service. This privacy policy ("<b>Privacy Policy</b>") describes our practices
					of processing data from visitors to the Website or from our clients and partners ("<b>Business
					Partners</b>") once they register to receive our API, analytic data, insights and filtered dashboard
					tool (all, collectively the "<b>Service</b>").
					<br>
					<br>
					For more details regarding the terms and conditions of our Services and Platform, please read our
					Terms of Use, available at: <a href="/terms">https://www.similartech.com/terms</a>. Note that, this
					Privacy Policy is an integral part of the Terms of Use (collectively the "<b>Agreement</b>").
					<br>
					<br>
					We have included below information about which data is collected, how we process and use your data,
					but before we would like to explain the basis on which we do so:<br>
				</p><ol>
					<li>Where you sign up for any of our services, we process your personal data in order to perform our
						contract with you;
					</li>
					<li>If we have a legitimate interest in processing data, such as for direct marketing or online
						identifiers when you access our Website; or
					</li>
					<li>We will also process your personal data where you have provided us with consent to do so.
				</li></ol>
				<p></p>

				<h3>What Type of Information We Collect</h3>
				<p>
					Depending on your interaction with us (meaning, if you are just browsing our Website, or if you have
					registered to our Services and opened an account, etc.), we may collect two types of information
					you, as follows:
				</p><ul>
					<li>Non-Personal Data: The first type of information is non-identifiable information which may be
						made available or gathered through your use of the Services. To clarify, we are not aware of
						your identity due to such information ("<b>Non-Personal Information</b>"). The Non-Personal
						Information which is being collected may include your aggregated usage information and technical
						information transmitted or automatically collected such as (but not limited to): the time and
						date you access our Website, your actions within our Services (e.g., registration, pages viewed,
						etc.) and approximate geo-location (country level).
					</li>
					<li>Personal Data: The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely
						information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual
						("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes either: (i) contact information such as
						your name, email address, etc., which you have submitted voluntarily; or (ii) your Internet
						Protocol ("<b>IP</b>") addresses (the addresses of computers on the Internet). Note that, while
						IP is considered personally identifiable information in many jurisdictions (such as the EEA),
						there are some jurisdictions in which such data is not considered as Personal Information.
						Therefore, we treat such information as Personal Information, in accordance with applicable
						laws, however we do not attempt to analyze or determine your identity based on such information
						or otherwise combine it with any Personal Information such as your name or email address. The IP
						is collected by our third party analytic partners that offer ways to opt-out, all as detailed
						below.
					</li>
				</ul>
				You are not required by law to provide us with any information. You can always avoid from providing us
				certain Personal Information; however, you acknowledge that it may prevent you from engaging in certain
				Services. For example, if you are a Business Partner, we will not be able to provide you with access to
				the Platform if you do not provide us with the information required through the registration process.

				In the event we combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information, the combined information
				will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.
