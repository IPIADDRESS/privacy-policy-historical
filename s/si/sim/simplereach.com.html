We analyze the personal information that we obtain only at the direction of our customer, and only on that customer’s behalf.</p><p>We may collect information about individuals who visit the digital media properties that have installed our technology at the direction of our customers (“end users”). SimpleReach, Inc. collects information under the direction of its customers on certain digital media properties. SimpleReach has no direct relationship with its customers’ end users. Our customers determine the scope of the information we receive, and the information we receive may vary by customer. If you are a customer of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our service, please contact the company that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.</p><p> Typically, when end users access our customers’ webpages, we automatically collect information about end users’ devices, as described further in the section titled “Cookies and Other Information Collected by Automated Means.” </p><p>We acknowledge that you have the right to access your personal information. SimpleReach has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the relevant customer of SimpleReach’s (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p><p>We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide services to our customers. SimpleReach will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p><p>COOKIES AND OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED BY AUTOMATED MEANS</p><p>We, our service providers, and our business partners, may collect certain information about the use of our websites by automated means, such as cookies, or similar technologies. Likewise, as part of our services, we may offer our customers the ability to install these types of technologies on their websites; and if a customer does so, we collect information on its behalf. </p><p>A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. We use both “session” and “persistent” cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track various types of information on our website and on our customers’ websites. A session cookie is one that disappears after you close your browser. While a persistent cookie remains after you close your browser (and may be used by your browser when you later return to the Service), persistent cookies generally can be removed. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to transmit information back to a web server. Web browsers may offer individuals the ability to disable receiving certain types of cookies; however, if cookies are disabled, some features or functionality of our websites or our customers’ websites may not function correctly. We and our service providers and business partners may collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites when you use our websites.</p><p>Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based do-not-track (“DNT”) mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time. Please see the “Privacy Preferences, Rights and Choices” section below for information about how you may opt out of, or limit the use of, your browsing behavior for online behavioral advertising purposes.</p><p>The information we collect by automated means varies based on whether we are collecting information for our own business purposes or whether we are collecting information from or on behalf of our customers to provide our services.</p><p><strong>Automated Data Collection for SimpleReach’s Own Business Purposes</strong></p><p>The information collected by automated means for our own business purposes includes:</p><p>•	Details about the devices that are used to access our websites (such as the IP address, and type of operating system and web browser)</p><p>•	Dates and times of visits to, and use of, our websites</p><p>•	Information about how our websites are used (such as the content that is viewed on our websites, how users navigate on and between our webpages, and the date and time of access)</p><p>•	Details about how individuals interact with our emails (such as whether the email is opened and which links are clicked in the email) </p><p>•	URLs that refer visitors to our websites</p><p>•	Search terms used to reach our websites</p><p><strong>Automated Data Collection on Behalf of Our Customers</strong></p><p>The information collected by automated means on behalf of our customers includes:</p><p>•	Details about the devices that are used to access our customers’ websites (such as the IP address, and type of operating system and web browser)</p><p>•	Dates and times of visits to, and use of, our customers’ websites and pages or articles on our customers’ websites</p><p>•	Information about how our customers’ websites are used (such as the content that is viewed on our customers’ websites, the links that are clicked, how users navigate on and between webpages, and the date and time of access)</p><p>•	URLs that refer visitors to our customers’ websites</p><p>•	Search terms used to reach our customers’ websites</p><p>INFORMATION USE</p><p><strong>Our Use of Personal Information for SimpleReach’s Own Business Purposes</strong></p><p>SimpleReach may use personal information to:</p><p>•	Provide our services to our customers</p><p>•	Communicate about the products and services we offer, and respond to requests, inquiries, comments, and suggestions, Analyze and enhance our communications and strategies (including by identifying when emails sent to you have been received and read)</p><p>•	Operate, evaluate and improve our business, our websites, and other products and services we offer (including to improve our algorithms and develop new products and services)</p><p>•	Invoice and collect payment for our services</p><p>•	Establish and maintain an individual’s profile on our website</p><p>•	Tailor the content we display in our communications and on our websites</p><p>•	To conduct research about SimpleReach or our services,</p><p>•	To notify you of technical updates or changes in policy,</p><p>•	To contact you for marketing and promotional purposes,</p><p>•	In response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security</p><p>or law enforcement requirements.</p><p>•	Comply with legal requirements, judicial process, and our company policies (including to verify users’ identity in connection with access or correction requests),</p><p>•	Protect against, identify, investigate, and respond to fraud, illegal activity (such as incidents of hacking or misuse of our websites), and claims and other liabilities, including by enforcing the terms and conditions that govern the services we provide,</p><p>•	Process employment applications,</p><p>•	Monitor recruiting statistics, to inform our recruitment activities.</p><p>In addition, we may aggregate and/or de-identify any information that we collect, such that the information no longer identifies any specific individual.

We use personal information only as directed or authorized by our customer. Typically, we are directed or authorized to use personal information collected on behalf of the customer to provide analytics regarding use of our customers’ websites and end user interactions with our customers’ content.</p><p>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</p><p>We will not sell or rent customers’ or end users’ personal information to third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.

If we engage in such a sale or transfer, we will – where required by applicable law – make reasonable efforts to direct the recipient to use your personal information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice. After such a sale or transfer, you may contact the recipient with any inquiries concerning the processing of your personal information.</p><p>In addition, we may share your information to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and protect against and prevent fraud, illegal activity (such as identifying and responding to incidents of hacking or misuse of our websites and mobile applications), and claims and other liabilities.</p><p>CAREERS</p><p>If you submit your information in connection with job opportunities at SimpleReach, we will use and disclose the information to process your application (including to contact you and/or your references and former employers if appropriate), to monitor recruitment statistics, and to comply with government reporting requirements. We also retain statistical information about applicants to help inform our recruitment activities. We will process this information based on our legitimate interest of evaluating job candidates or, when you provide us with sensitive information, based on your consent.</p><p>SimpleReach uses RecruiterBox to manage a pipeline of job candidates including interview scheduling, evaluations, interview stages, messaging, and candidate profiles. RecruiterBox acts at our direction when it hosts our jobs page containing job descriptions, where candidates can submit applications for consideration for employment with SimpleReach.</p><p>PRIVACY PREFERENCES, RIGHTS, AND CHOICES</p><p><strong><em>Marketing emails</em></strong></p><p>You may unsubscribe from receiving marketing or other commercial emails from SimpleReach by following the instructions included in the email.
