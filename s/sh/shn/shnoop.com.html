<h3>
	What Information We May Collect</h3>
<p>
	Generally, our customers and investors can visit our Website without providing or revealing any personal or Personally Identifiable Information. We receive and store certain types of information whenever visitors interact with our Website. We may track the Internet domain address from which our visitors visit our Website and analyze this data for trends and statistics. Unless a visitor to our Website voluntarily provides Personally Identifiable Information to us, each individual customer remains anonymous.</p>
<p>
	We receive and may store certain Personally Identifiable Information that our visitors enter when visiting our website or provide to us in other ways. For instance, we collect the information you provide to us when you place an order, register with us, send an email or call us, enter a sweepstakes or contest, subscribe to a service, enroll in a club, request to receive a catalog, or participate in a promotion. This information may include your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, product purchases, birth date, gender, occupation, personal interests, and other similar personal or preference data that you provide to us. It may also include information you submit about other people such as the name and address of a gift recipient. Whether or not you provide such information to us is completely your own choice.</p>
<h3>
	How We Use Your Information</h3>
<p>
	We use the personal and/or Personally Identifiable Information you provide for our internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products (including products of our affiliates), services and offers, and providing you with information from and about our stores, catalogs and websites.</p>
<p>
	From time to time, we may also work with other organizations that we believe are trustworthy and offer products or services that may be of interest to you. In such instances, we might share limited information (such as your name and postal address) that we have collected from you, including Personally Identifiable Information, so that such organizations may contact you with offers that may interest you. However, we will not share your information with these organizations if you have requested that we refrain from doing so.</p>
<p>
	To serve you better, we may combine the information you give us online, through our catalogs, and from our retail locations; publicly available information; and information we receive from others. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes.</p>
<p>
	Also, we may contract with third-party service providers to provide certain services for our business, such as credit card processing, computer system services, shipping, data management, or promotional services. We provide the information needed for these service providers to perform these services. The information we provide may include some of our customers' personal and Personally Identifiable Information. However, these service providers are not authorized to use any of the information we share with them for any purposes other than to provide services to us.</p>
<p>
	We may share information that we have collected with governmental agencies and other organizations assisting us in fraud prevention or for investigative purposes. We may do so when permitted or mandated by law; trying to protect against or prevent fraud; attempting to prevent unauthorized or improper transactions; or investigating fraud or improper conduct that has already taken place. In these instances, the information is not provided to these agencies or organizations for marketing or any other unrelated purposes.</p>
<p>
	Additionally, we may share your email address, name, telephone number, and postal address within the blingdaily.com family of businesses. Also, when you purchase from us through our catalogs or Websites we may need to contact you via phone, email, or mail to address issues specific to your order, even if you have opted to not receive communications from us.</p>
<p>
	From time to time we may also market certain third-party services through our Website. Should you choose to accept an offer from a third-party, we will pass your relevant Personally Identifiable Information, including your name, postal address, credit/debit card number and any other required billing information to that specific third-party.</p>
<p>
	Finally, if some or all of the business assets of any our company are sold or transferred, we generally would transfer the corresponding information regarding our customers and visitors to the purchaser. We also may retain a copy of that information.</p>
<h3>
	Changes to Your Information</h3>
<p>
	You may update your registered Personally Identifiable Information at any time. This includes your name, password, email, and postal address. You may also manage your mailing preferences and email formats.</p>
<p>
	If at any time you would like us to update your Personally Identifiable Information or remove you from our email or postal mailing lists, or if you need assistance with the modification of your information, send us an email with your request.</p>
<h3>
	Opting Out of Sharing Information</h3>
<p>
	You may opt out of future unaffiliated third-party disclosures of your information. Such opt-out will not affect disclosures otherwise permitted by law including but not limited to:</p>

<h3>
	Protecting Your Child's Privacy</h3>
<p>
	Our Website is not designed for use by anyone under the age of 13 (a child), though we realize we may have users under this age. We do not verify the age of our users nor do we have any liability for verifying a user's age. Furthermore, if you are under the age of 18, please seek the permission of a parent or guardian before placing an order. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child is using our Website, please contact us. If a child submits information to us and we know that the individuals submitting the information are indeed children, we will delete the information as soon as we discover it, we will not use the information for any purpose, and we will not disclose the information to third parties. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child is using our Website, please contact us. We may ask you for proof of identification before we remove any information to prevent malicious removal of account information.</p>
<h3>
	Our Email Policy</h3>
<p>
	Our affiliates and we fully comply with the international laws prohibiting SPAM. You can always opt out of receipt of further email correspondence from us.

<h3>
	Payment Methods</h3>
<p>
	You may have to provide a payment method (i.e. credit card or PayPal) to purchase Products from our Website. We use third-party billing services and HAVE NO CONTROL over these services. We will use our best efforts to make sure that your credit card number is kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL by using only third-party billing services that use industry-standard encryption technology to protect your payment method from unauthorized use. However, you understand and agree that we are in no way responsible for any misuse of your payment method.</p>
<h3>
	Cookies</h3>
<p>
	Our Website may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage your system.

Most browser software can be set to reject Cookies. However, if you reject our Cookies, certain functionality on our Website may not work correctly or at all. We do not place Personally Identifiable Information in Cookies.</p>

We do not link Non-Personal Information from Web Beacons to Personally Identifiable Information without your permission.</p>
<h3>
	Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
