<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="choices" id="choices"></a>Your Information Choices</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How to Tell Us to Limit the Sharing of Information Within the BB&amp;T Corporate Family</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you ask us to limit the sharing of information within our corporate family, you may miss learning of financial products and services offered by these companies that might be of benefit to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you prefer that we not share application information and credit-related information obtained from you and others with companies within the BB&amp;T Corporate Family, you may direct us not to share (opt out) by calling us at 1-888-800-3420 between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m., ET, 7 days a week. We will process your request as soon as we reasonably can. If you have already directed us not to share, you do not need to opt out again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Your choice to limit the sharing of information only covers application information and credit-related information obtained from you and others that we might otherwise share within our corporate family. We may continue to share other information about you within the BB&amp;T Corporate Family as permitted by law, such as information about your transactions with us and certain identifying information, including name, address, telephone number, and Social Security Number. Each company within the BB&amp;T Corporate Family will continue to contact its consumer clients with offers of its own products and services. You will continue to receive product messages via your statement(s), as well as telephone and mail offers from BB&amp;T companies with whom you have relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How to Tell Us to Limit Marketing Within the BB&amp;T Corporate Family</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Federal law gives you the right to limit some, but not all marketing from the BB&amp;T companies. Federal law also requires us to give you this notice to tell you about your choice to limit marketing from the BB&amp;T companies. This federal law is effective October 1, 2008.</li>
        <li>You may limit the BB&amp;T companies, such as the banking, lending, credit card, insurance, and securities companies, from marketing their products or services to you based on your personal information that they receive from other BB&amp;T companies. This information may include your income, your account history, and your credit score.</li>
        <li>Your choice to limit marketing offers from the BB&amp;T companies will apply for at least five years from when you tell us your choice. Once that period expires, you will receive a renewal notice that will allow you to continue to limit marketing offers from the BB&amp;T companies for at least another five years.</li>
        <li>Beginning October 1, 2008, you may limit marketing offers by contacting us by telephone: 1-888-800-3420 between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m., ET, 7 days a week.</li>
    </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Joint Accounts — For a joint account (one account held by two or more consumers), each of the joint accountholders may exercise the right to opt out. We will treat an opt-out direction by one joint accountholder as applying to all of the joint accountholders with respect to that joint account. For example, if Pat and Kim have a joint account, Pat's opt-out direction will also apply to Kim with respect to the joint account, but not to Kim's individual accounts. Kim may separately exercise the right to opt out as to Kim's individual accounts. In this example, Pat's opt out will also apply to all of Pat's individual accounts.</p>

Our employees are bound by our Code of Ethics and policies to access consumer information only for legitimate business purposes and to keep information about you confidential.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="other" id="other"></a>Other Privacy Protections</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have other privacy protections under some state laws. We will comply with applicable state laws as to information about you. For example, certain state laws may restrict the types of information we may disclose about you or require us to provide you with an additional notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accounts with California addresses will be treated as if you opted out of joint marketing arrangements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accounts with Vermont addresses will be treated as if you opted out of sharing of information among the BB&amp;T Corporate Family and opted out of joint marketing arrangements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will not use or share personally identifiable medical information for any purpose other than the underwriting or administration of your insurance account, policy, or claim, unless otherwise required or permitted by law.</p>
