	<h1>Privacy policy</h1><br>
<div id="content_box"><br>
<p>At SheerLuxe.com ("SheerLuxe"), we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices and policy regarding the collection <br>
and use of information (including personally identifiable information) made available to us through the www.sheerluxe.com website (the "SheerLuxe Site"). <br>
<br>
</p><p>You are, of course, free to use the majority of the SheerLuxe Site without providing any information to us. However, to the extent that you or other <br>
users do provide or make available any information to us, that information can generally be categorized as either anonymous or personally identifiable. <br>
Anonymous information is information that cannot be traced back to a specific individual. Personally identifiable information is information from which you <br>
or another individual can be identified. This information can include your name, email, address, postcode, age, etc. <br>
<br>
</p><p><b>Opt In</b><br>
</p><p>When you register as a member of SheerLuxe.com or sign up for any of the services that we offer to members or other users on a subscription basis, for <br>
example, newsletters and/or email communications about news and events ("Services") you will be asked to 'opt in' to our Privacy Policy i.e. to confirm <br>
that you agree to our use of any personally identifiable information that we may collect from you or be provided with by you in connection with your use of <br>
the SheerLuxe.com Site. By 'opting-in' you agree to our use of your information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not provide <br>
your consent, you will not be able to become a member of SheerLuxe.com and/or use the Services. If you do subscribe to any of our Services you may also <br>
unsubscribe from the relevant distribution list(s) at any time. You may also withdraw your consent to our use of any other personally identifiable <br>
information that we hold on you at any time. If you wish to unsubscribe from our Services or withdraw any consent that you have previously provided to our <br>
use of your personally identifiable information, please see paragraph 12 below (Unsubscribing, Correction and Deletion of Personally Identifiable <br>
Information). <br>
Our privacy policy is simple.<br>
<br>
</p><h3>1. Collection of Personally Identifiable</h3><br>
<p><b>Information</b><br>
</p><p>SheerLuxe collects the details provided by you when you register as a member of SheerLuxe.com or sign up for any of our Services together with any <br>
personally identifiable information we learn about you through your use of the Services. For example, we may collect additional personally identifiable <br>
information through your participation in any promotions and competitions offered by us. <br>
</p><p>We will notify our members when we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy that affect the use of any personally identifiable information we <br>
collect. We will not make new use of any personally identifiable information which SheerLuxe gathered from individual members or users prior to any such <br>
change in our Privacy Policy without first obtaining the member's or user's consent for any new uses. <br>
<br>
</p><h3>2. Security</h3><br>
<p>The security of your personally identifiable information is a priority to us. Unfortunately, no security system, or system of transmitting data over the <br>
internet, can be guaranteed to be 100 per cent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot <br>
guarantee the security of our servers, the means by which information is transmitted between your computer and our servers, or any information provided to <br>
us or to any third party through or in connection with the SheerLuxe Site. You provide all such information at your own risk.<br>
<br>
</p><h3>3. Newsletter and Email Communications Subscribers</h3><br>
<p>If you decide not to become a member of SheerLuxe.com but wish to subscribe to one or more of our newsletters or email communications services, we will <br>
need to collect your email address in order to send our newsletters and/or email communications to you. We will not use your email address for any purpose <br>
except in connection with sending you the newsletters and/or emails you have requested, maintaining our subscription and unsubscription lists, <br>
communicating with you in the event of a change in the ownership of SheerLuxe or its business, or notifying you of changes to the SheerLuxe Site, business <br>
practices, Terms of Service or Privacy Policy, unless (i) we are required to do so by applicable law or pursuant to a court or similar order; (ii) as <br>
deemed necessary, in SheerLuxe discretion, to protect the legal rights or the property of SheerLuxe, a member or third party, or to prevent personal <br>
injury; or (iii) you have provided your consent for us to do so.<br>
<br>
</p><h3>4. Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information</h3><br>
<p>It is possible that the selections you make or information that you provide when using our Services may indicate information about you that is sensitive <br>
such as the state of your health or your sexual orientation. As with all of the personally identifiable information you provide to us, you can be assured <br>
that any sensitive information you choose to supply to us will be used only in accordance with this Privacy Policy and/or applicable law.<br>
<br>
</p><h3>5. How we use the Personally Identifiable<br>
Information you provide</h3><br>
<p>We use the personally identifiable information we collect to supply our Services to you. We may also use your contact details to communicate with you <br>
(including without limitation in the event of a change in ownership of SheerLuxe or its business, our business practices, or our Terms of Service or <br>
Privacy Policy). Except where you have asked us not to, we may contact you by email, post, text message or telephone. We may also use your personally <br>
identifiable information to send you information, special offers, promotions, coupons and free samples whether on behalf of ourselves or our group <br>
companies or on behalf of carefully selected third parties.<br>
<br>
</p><h3>6. Disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information</h3><br>
<p>We may disclose your personally identifiable information in the following instances: (i) if we are required to do so by applicable law or pursuant to a <br>
court or similar order; (ii) as deemed necessary, in SheerLuxe discretion, to protect the legal rights or the property of SheerLuxe, a member or third <br>
party, or to prevent personal injury; and/or (iii) in connection with a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a <br>
portion or all of the assets or stock of SheerLuxe or its affiliated entities (including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar <br>
proceedings). In addition, SheerLuxe reserves the right to allow access to its systems to third parties providing necessary technical services when such <br>
access is required in order to provide those services and to provide your personally identifiable information to third parties who provide services on <br>
behalf of SheerLuxe, provided that such third parties are bound by SheerLuxe Privacy Policy. <br>
<br>
</p><h3>7. Other Web Sites</h3><br>
<p>Where we provide links to third party web sites (whether or not they are affiliated with SheerLuxe and even if SheerLuxe branding appears on these <br>
sites), such sites are not controlled by us and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. These links are provided for your convenience only. If you access <br>
these sites by using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their <br>
privacy policy. Although where possible we endeavour to ensure that the site operators abide by our Privacy Policy, we cannot guarantee that they will and <br>
you are advised to check the privacy policy of such third parties before providing information to them. <br>
<br>
</p><h3>8. Cookie</h3><br>
<p>Use of Cookies on our Site <br>
</p><p>A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the <br>
website can remember who you are. <br>
</p><p>A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the 'lifetime' of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly <br>
generated unique number. <br>
</p><p>Two types of cookies are used on this website: <br>
session cookies - temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site; <br>
persistent cookies - these remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). <br>
</p><p>Cookies can help a website to arrange content to match your preferred interests more quickly. Most major websites use cookies.<br>
 <br>
</p><p>How we use cookies on our website and what information we collect<br>
Session cookies: <br>
</p><ul><br>
<p>To allow you to carry information across pages of our site and avoid having to log-in many times. <br>
</p><p>Within registration to allow you to access stored information. <br>
Persistent cookies: <br>
</p><p>To help us recognise you as a unique visitor (just a number) when you return to our website and to allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match <br>
your preferred interests or to avoid showing you the same adverts repeatedly. <br>
</p><p>To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. We <br>
cannot identify you personally in this way. <br>
</p><p>Within research surveys to ensure you are not invited to complete a questionnaire too often or after you have already done so. <br>
</p><p>To store registration information so that if you are a member you only have to re-enter your password (instead of all your registration information) <br>
each time you visit the site, and so that the site can recognise you as a member. <br>
</p></ul><br>
<br>
<p>We do not pass any personally identifiable information obtained by cookie use to third party advertising companies. <br>
<br>
</p><p>Third-party cookies: <br>
</p><p>Third parties serve cookies via this site. These are used for the following purposes:<br>
<br>
</p><ul> <br>
<p>To serve advertisements on our site and track whether these advertisements are clicked on by users. <br>
</p><p>To control how often you are shown a particular advertisement. <br>
</p><p>To tailor content to your preferences. <br>
</p><p>To count the number of anonymous users of our site. <br>
</p><p>To aggregate anonymised information for marketing purposes.<br>
</p></ul> <br>
<p>Use of web beacons <br>
<br>Some of our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes known as clear gifs) that allow us to count users who have visited <br>
these pages. Web beacons collect only limited information which including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on <br>
which the web beacon resides. We may also carry web beacons placed by third-party advertisers. These beacons do not carry any personally identifiable <br>
information and are only used to track the effectiveness of a particular campaign. <br>
 <br>
</p><p><b>Disabling or enabling cookies</b><br>
</p><p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive <br>
features of our site if cookies are disabled. <br>
<br>
</p><h3>9. Bulletin Boards, Chat Rooms and Other Public Forums</h3><br>
<p>Please note that our forums are open to the public and if you choose to disclose personally identifiable information in these areas you are consenting <br>
to its unrestricted distribution in a public forum throughout SheerLuxe.com and to and by other SheerLuxe.com members. We therefore cannot be responsible <br>
for the protection or security of such information, regardless of its sensitivity. You disclose all such information on our bulletin boards or in our chat <br>
rooms or other public forums entirely at your own risk. <br>
<br>
</p><h3>10. Third Party Personally Identifiable Information</h3> <br>
<p>You must not disclose personally identifiable information relating to any third party on our bulletin boards or in our chat rooms or other public forums <br>
or in conjunction with any Service (for example, when using our postcard service) unless you have their express consent to do so.<br>
<br>
</p><h3>11. General</h3><br>
<p>Your personally identifiable information will be held and used by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy and UK data protection legislation. You have <br>
a right to access the personally identifiable information that is held about you. To obtain a copy of the personally identifiable information SheerLuxe <br>
holds about you please contact us via email with your name and address. <br>

by this reference. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the SheerLuxe Site and do not register for any of the Services. Subject to <br>
the provisions above regarding material changes to this Privacy Policy, which we will notify you of, we may change this Privacy Policy from time to time <br>
without notice (including, without limitation, on the introduction of new services to our users which affect our privacy practices). Any such change will <br>
take effect once the revised privacy policy is available on SheerLuxe.com. You will be bound by any such changes to the Privacy Policy. Therefore, we ask <br>
that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure your continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy Policy. Your <br>
continued use of the SheerLuxe Site following such changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept those changes. You can determine when this policy was <br>
last revised by checking the "Last Revised" legend at the top of this Privacy Policy.<br>
