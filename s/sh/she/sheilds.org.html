<p><b><big><big><big>Privacy policy <span lang="en-gb">SHEilds</span> </big></big></big></b></p>
<font face="Arial">

</font><p><font face="Arial"><br>
</font><big>The basic principles of <span lang="en-gb">SHEilds</span> privacy policy are: </big>

</p><ul>
  <li><big><span lang="en-gb">SHEilds</span> shall not make use of your Personal 
  Details without your permission, except where necessary to supply the services 
  expressly requested by you. (e.g. by way of using one of the SHEilds services) </big></li>
  <li><big>SHEilds shall give you the opportunity to check and correct
    the information relating to you. </big></li>
</ul>
<b>

</b><p><b><big>Definitions</big></b><big> </big></p>

<p><big>"Personal Details" refers to every detail concerning an identified or
identifiable natural person. Examples of these details are: name, date of birth, e-mail
address, postal address, etc. </big></p>

<p><big>"Anonymous Data" are data that cannot be traced back to natural persons.
In other words, these are data that cannot be used to identify you. They include details
relating to the way you use the SHEilds websites. Anonymous Data also
include the domain names and/or IP addresses of internet browsers that consult the 
SHEilds websites, the times at which the websites are visited, and other
data that cannot be used to identify natural persons. Anonymous data help 
SHEilds to improve its website and service on the basis of user behaviour. </big></p>
<b>

</b><p><b><big>Collection and use of personal details</big></b><big> <b>Registration</b> </big></p>

<p><big>You can visit our website and use SHEilds's services without
providing your Personal Details to SHEilds. You will only be asked to
provide certain Personal Details to SHEilds if you register as a SHEilds
<span lang="en-gb">newsletter subscriber</span>, or a user of any
forthcoming on-line resources. You will also be asked for some Personal Details if you
request information about our services or general information. </big></p>

<p><big>For instance, SHEilds requests Personal Details (such as your
first name and surname, e-mail address, website address, etc.) so that 
<span lang="en-gb">we</span> can contact you.
</big></p>

<p><big>SHEilds uses this information for the following purposes: to
provide you with support in the use of its products and services; to use your first name
and surname in e-mail messages and newsletters that SHEilds sends to
users of its services; to inform you about new services. </big></p>
<b>

</b><p><b><big>Sharing Personal Details with others </big></b></p>

<p><big>SHEilds shall not share any Personal Details with third
parties without your consent. </big></p>
<b>

</b><p><b><big>Publication of your identity </big></b></p>

<p><big>SHEilds occasionally receives requests to publish the
identity of the users of the SHEilds website and services. SHEilds refuses all such requests, unless it is obliged by law to comply
with them. </big></p>

<p><big>If a government agency (for example the public prosecution department or the
courts, etc.) orders SHEilds to publish your Personal Details, SHEilds shall comply. </big></p>
<b>

</b><p><b><big>Anonymous Information </big></b></p>

<p><big>SHEilds collects Anonymous Data when users visit its website
or use its services, even if the users are not registered as users with SHEilds. 
SHEilds uses this information to improve the overall
level of service. </big></p>
<b>

</b><p><b><big>Cookies (and how they are used by SHEilds)</big></b><big> </big></p>

<p><big>A "cookie" is a package of information that is sent by a webserver to
your browser and then stored on the hard disk of your computer. Cookies do not damage your
computer. Cookies make it easier to surf the Internet, because they save your preferences
while you are visiting the SHEilds website. This allows SHEilds to adapt the site to your needs. By adjusting the settings of your
browser you can say whether or not you want to accept cookies. If you decide not to accept
any cookies, your may benefit less from the use of our site and some elements will not
work as intended. </big></p>
<b>

</b><p><b><big>Use of IP addresses</big></b><big> </big></p>

<p><big>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a series of numbers which is automatically
assigned to your computer when you log in via your internet service provider or via your
organisations network. This can be via a single-location network, or Local Area Network
(LAN), or via networks at various locations which are connected to each other, a Wide Area
Network (WAN). Webservers, the powerful computers which make it possible to display
websites, identify your computer through its IP address while you are online. </big></p>

<p><big>SHEilds may collect IP addresses for the following purposes: </big></p>

<p><big>to survey user behaviour and the geographic origin of users of the 
SHEilds website and to provide anonymous user information to SHEilds's advertisers. 
SHEilds does not match any IP
addresses of users to Personal Details. </big></p>
<b>

</b><p><b><big>Security</big></b><big> </big></p>

<p><big>SHEilds protects its databases with firewalls and passwords.
SHEilds has introduced security measures to safeguard that customer
information available to SHEilds cannot be lost, abused and/or
altered. Only specific employees of SHEilds have access to the
databases containing your Personal Details. Although SHEilds cannot
guarantee that the Personal Details will not be lost, abused or altered, SHEilds does everything possible to prevent any such problems. </big></p>
