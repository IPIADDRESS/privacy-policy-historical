<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you.

If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<p><strong><a name="part6">6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</a></strong></p>
<p>Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by implementing safeguards:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will only transfer data to a country on the EU Commission’s list of countries or territories providing adequate protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in connection with the processing of their personal data.</li>
<li>We will ensure appropriate safeguards can be provided for by model contract clauses or binding corporate rules (BCRs).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <a href="https://www.sheffieldforum.co.uk/support/" style="text-decoration:underline;">contact us</a> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
<p><strong><a name="part7">7. DATA SECURITY</a></strong></p>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p><strong><a name="part8">8. DATA RETENTION</a></strong></p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by using the details on our <a href="https://www.sheffieldforum.co.uk/support/" style="text-decoration:underline;">contact us page.</a></p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see 9. Your legal rights below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<p><strong><a name="part9">9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</a></strong></p>
<p>Unless subject to an exemption under the data protection laws, you have the following rights with respect to your personal data:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to request a copy of the personal data which we hold about you;</li>
<li>The right to request that we correct any personal data if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date;</li>
<li>The right to request your personal data is erased where it is no longer necessary to retain such data;</li>
<li>The right to withdraw your consent to the processing at any time, where consent was the lawful basis for processing your data;</li>
<li>The right to request that we provide you with your personal data and where possible, to transmit that data directly to another data controller, (known as the right to data portability), where applicable i.e. where our processing is based on consent or is necessary for the performance of our contract with you or where we process your data by automated means);</li>
<li>The right, where there is a dispute in relation to the accuracy or processing of your personal data, to request a restriction is placed on further processing;</li>
<li>The right to object to our processing of personal data, where applicable i.e. where processing is based on our legitimate interests (or in performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority); direct marketing or processing for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please&nbsp;contact our Data Protection Officer using the details found on our <a href="https://www.sheffieldforum.co.uk/support/" style="text-decoration:underline;">Contact Us page.</a></p>
<p><strong><u>No fee required – with some exceptions</u></strong></p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable admin fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong><u>What we may need from you</u></strong></p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p><strong><u>Time limit to respond</u></strong></p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p><strong><a name="part10">10. CHANGES TO THIS NOTICE AND YOUR DUTY TO INFORM US OF CHANGES</a></strong></p>
<p>This version was last updated on 24/05/2018.</p>
<p>Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us. It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current.</p>
<p><strong><a name="part11">11. QUERIES, REQUESTS OR CONCERNS</a></strong></p>
<p>To exercise all relevant rights, queries or complaints in relation to this policy or any other data protection matter between you and us, please in the first instance contact our Data Protection Officer using the details found on our <a href="https://www.sheffieldforum.co.uk/support/" style="text-decoration:underline;">Contact Us page.</a></p>
