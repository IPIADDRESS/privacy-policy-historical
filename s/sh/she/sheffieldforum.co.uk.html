<br><br>
<b>Data Controller</b><br>

<br><br>
<b>Personal Data</b><br> 
4.	In accordance with our Terms of Use, (the “Terms”) you will need to register on the Website in order to use the X-Line services set out in the Terms.<br> 
5.	The information you give may us via the online registration form or otherwise may include personal data, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, contact preferences, age, sex, or those of any minor for whom you are parent or legal guardian.<br> 
6.	You may also submit material comprising sensitive personal data under the Data Protection Act 1998, such as information on your racial or ethnic origin, your political opinions, your religious beliefs, any trade union activity you are or have been involved in, your physical or mental health or condition, your sexual life, the commission of any offences by you or any proceedings relating to a criminal offence.<br> 
<br><b>Use of Personal Data</b><br>
7.	We collect your personal data for the purpose of providing the services described in the Terms, in relation to which you have registered your interest.<br> 
8.	We do not collect additional information about you from other sources, such as public records or bodies, or private organisations.<br>
9.	We may use your personal data to better understand who uses our Website and the pages they access so as to be able to improve the Website.<br> 
10.	We may use your personal data to communicate with you and provide information about our services and the services of others pursuant to your requests.<br> 
11.	From time to time, we may use your personal data to contact you for market research or client care survey purposes, but we will always give you the opportunity to opt-out of such market research and client care surveys. We will otherwise ensure that your personal data will not be disclosed to other organisations, institutions and authorities unless required by law.<br> 
12.	X-Line will not send you any marketing emails unless you give us your consent, or we have it already.<br> 
13.	You agree to the use of your personal data or other personal data you have provided to us for the above purposes.<br><br>
<b>Use of Sensitive Personal Data</b><br>
14.	With regard to any sensitive personal data which you submit, you hereby expressly consent to our processing of such sensitive personal data for the purpose of the inclusion of that sensitive personal data on the Website. If we wish to use your sensitive personal data for any different purposes, we will seek your explicit permission first. We take seriously the trust you place in us.<br>
15.	Your personal data and sensitive personal data will be available online if you include any such data in items uploaded to the Website or included in your public profile. By uploading such content you acknowledge that such information may be seen and used by third parties. You hereby expressly consent to such use.<br><br>
<b>Disclosure of Data</b><br>
16.	We will not disclose your personal data or sensitive personal data provided by you to us to any third party except as set out as follows:<br>
a.	We will disclose your data to our agents inside or outside of the European Union for the purpose of the technical operation of the website; and<br>
b.	We may disclose any information in compliance with a court order, or threat of a court order, or to law enforcement authorities, as we deem appropriate.<br><br>
<b>Automatic Collection of Data</b><br>
17.	The Website automatically captures and stores the following data when you visit the Website: your IP address, when you last visited the Website and when you last posted.<br>
18.	All networks connected to the Internet communicate in “IP” (Internet Protocol), which is a technical standard that allows data to be transmitted between two devices. “TCP/IP” (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is responsible for making sure messages get from one host to another and that the messages are understood. An IP address is a string of code which identifies your personal computer and tells the Internet that you are connected.<br> 
19.	We use Google Analytics to analyse traffic on the Website, including the number of visitors to the Website and the number of page views. This helps us gauge traffic and the popularity of certain pages.<br>
20.	We may use cookies for collecting information on the Website. Cookies are messages given to an Internet browser by an Internet server. The browser, in a text file called cookie.txt, then stores the message. Each time the browser requests a page from the server, this message is sent back. A cookie's main objective is to identify users and personalise their visit by customising web pages for them, for example by welcoming them by name next time they visit the same website.<br> 
21.	We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use anonymous information (i.e. not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and would like to know your options in relation to not having this information used by these companies, click here.<br> 
<b>Security of Personal Data</b><br>
22.	We set strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal data once we have received it and wherever possible we will use adequate security software and working procedures to ensure the security of your personal data. To prevent unauthorised access, maintain accuracy, and ensure proper use of personal data, we have employed physical, electronic, and managerial processes to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.<br> 
23.	However, transmission of data and information via the Website is not a secure or encrypted transmission method for sending your personal data, unless otherwise indicated on the Website. Accordingly, your attention is drawn to the fact that any information and personal data carried over the Internet is not secure. Information and personal data may be intercepted, lost, redirected, corrupted, changed and accessed by other people.<br><br>
<b>Accuracy of Data</b><br>
24.	It is both in our interest and yours to store and process accurate personal data. If the data we hold about you is inaccurate in any way, where appropriate, you may have your personal data corrected by us on request by having it completed; amended; and/or erased.<br>
25.	Please contact us to update any of your personal data or to request access to your personal data by addressing the “Information Officer” via <a href="http://www.sheffieldforum.co.uk/misc.php?do=form&amp;fid=2">this contact form.</a><br><br>
<b>Subject Access Rights</b><br>
26.	Under the Data Protection Act 1998, we have to provide you, as a “data subject” with a readable copy of all personal data which we may hold about you, within 40 days of receiving your written request for us to provide it. The Data Protection Act 1998 allows us to charge a fee of £10 pounds for this. Evidence or proof of your identity (for example, a copy of your passport, driver’s licence or current bills) will be required.<br> 
27.	We reserve the right to refuse to provide you with a copy of your personal data based on the exemptions set out in the Data Protection Act 1998, but if we do refuse we will give full reasons for our refusal and allow you to challenge our decision.<br><br>
<b>Third Party Websites</b><br>
28.	Parts of our Website contain links to third party websites (“Third Party Websites”) for your convenience and information. If you use these links, you will leave the Website. When you access a Third Party Website, please understand that we do not control the content of that Third Party Website and are not responsible for the privacy practices of that Third Party Website.<br>

Third Party Websites may send their own cookies to users, collect personal data, or solicit personal information. Third Party Websites may operate very different privacy practices to this Website.

32.	You agree that if we transfer ownership or management of the Website or X-Line to a third party we may also transfer personal data provided to us, including all sensitive personal data and any other information about you to such third party, provided such third party agrees to observe this policy.<br><br>
<b>Feedback</b><br>
