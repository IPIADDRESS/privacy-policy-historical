<h2>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT:</h2>
<p>
Starwood collects information about our guests and visitors to our web sites 
so that we can provide an experience that is responsive to our guests' and 
visitors' needs. Information may be collected as part of: (i) fulfilling 
reservation or information requests, (ii) purchasing products, (iii) 
registering for program membership, (iv) submitting a job application, or (v) 
responding to communications from us (e.g., surveys, promotional offers, or 
reservation confirmations). We endeavor to collect information only with your 
knowledge and with your permission if necessary. The types of personally 
identifiable information that we collect may include your name, home, work and 
e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers, credit card information, date of 
birth, gender, and lifestyle information such as room preferences, leisure 
activities, names and ages of children, and other information necessary to 
fulfill special requests (e.g., health conditions that require special room 
accommodations).
</p>
<p>
Starwood may also collect non-personally identifiable information about you, 
such as your use of our web sites, communication preferences, travel habits, 
aggregated data relative to your stays, and responses to promotional offers 
and surveys.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
</p>
<a name="purpose"></a>
<h2>PURPOSE FOR COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND DISCLOSURE:</h2>
<h3>Collection &amp; Use</h3>
<p>
Starwood is fully committed to providing you with information about the 
collection and use of personally identifiable information (PII) furnished by, 
or collected from, visitors while using our web sites, products and services. 
It is our practice not to ask you for information unless we need it or intend 
to use it. Some of the primary purposes for collecting your PII are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
providing services such as processing a transaction (e.g., making a 
reservation, fulfilling a request for information, or completing a product 
order)
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
marketing and communications with you in relation to the products and services 
offered by Starwood, our strategic marketing partners, and other trusted third 
parties
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
performing market research via surveys to better serve your needs, improve the 
effectiveness of our web sites, your hotel experience, our various types of 
communications, advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities
</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
You will always be offered the choice not to submit your PII or to decide what 
communications you want to receive from us. However, doing so may cause 
certain transactions to become affected. For example, not providing a name 
will prevent the processing of reservations.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
</p>
<h3>Processing and Disclosure</h3>
<p>
In most cases, the information you provide is added to a local or global 
database. In the course of processing your information, it may be necessary to 
transfer your PII to Starwood's affiliates, properties within the Starwood 
system and/or third party service providers located in the United States and 
throughout the world for the purposes outlined within this Privacy Statement. 
As a general practice, Starwood does not sell, rent, or give physical 
possession of your PII to unaffiliated third parties outside the Starwood 
system. Situations in which Starwood may disclose your information to others 
include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
when we have received your consent to do so
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
in situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in 
order to offer you products or services you desire (e.g., a vacation package)
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
when companies or services providers that perform business activities on 
behalf of Starwood require such information (e.g., credit card processing, 
customer support services, market research administration or database 
management services)
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
when a hotel or other property leaves the Starwood system and access to your 
PII is necessary to facilitate business operations or meet contractual 
obligations
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
in the event Starwood is merged or acquired by another company
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance 
with applicable law or court order
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
in case of emergency such as to safeguard the life, health, or property of an 
individual
</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
If information is shared as mentioned above, we seek to limit the scope of 
information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of 
the specific function. Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require 
third parties to protect your PII and abide by applicable privacy laws and 
regulations.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
</p>
<a name="consent"></a>
<h2>CONSENT:</h2>
<p>
As part of our commitment to keep you informed, we may mail, e-mail, 
telephone, or contact you by other means to notify you of new Starwood 
products and services, or upcoming Starwood special offers, events, 
enhancements, or other relevant information that may be of interest to you.&nbsp; 
You may also receive mailings or other communications from carefully selected 
third parties. We always offer you the option to decline any or all of these 
communications by following the directions included in our e-mails or other 
communications, or by contacting Starwood directly.
</p>
<p>
If you are a Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) program member, you may also 
change your communication choices by updating your e-mail preferences in your 
individual membership profile.
</p>
<p>
We would like to keep all of our guests and visitors informed and equally able 
to take advantage of the benefits offered by Starwood and its strategic 
marketing partners. However, if you reside outside of the United States, 
certain data privacy regulations may require us to obtain your permission 
before we send you information that you have not requested from us.
</p>
<p>
In some cases your permission will be implied from the nature of the service 
requested or transaction undertaken. For example, Starwood may collect and use 
personally identifiable information that you volunteer, or behavioral data or 
information collected in the aggregate. In addition, your permission will be 
deemed given for communications from us that are necessary to fulfill 
transactions and services that you request.
</p>
<p>
In certain circumstances, we will seek your express permission when we collect 
information that is regarded under certain data privacy regulations to be 
sensitive in nature (e.g., information revealing racial or ethnic origin, 
political opinions, or health conditions).

<h2>DATA TRANSFERS ACROSS INTERNATIONAL BORDERS:</h2>
<p>
As a global company, we endeavor to provide you with the same outstanding 
service in New York City, as you would find in Paris or Beijing. To achieve 
this goal, we have established a global network comprised of properties, 
offices, data centers, trusted marketing partners, service providers, customer 
contact centers, and trained associates around the globe. The nature of our 
business and our operations require us to transfer your information, including 
personally identifiable information (PII), to other group companies, 
properties, centers of operations, data centers, or service providers that may 
be located in countries outside of your own.&nbsp;Although the data protection and 
other laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those in 
your own country, Starwood will take appropriate steps to ensure that your PII 
is protected and handled as described in this Privacy Statement. Japan 
residents, please <a href="javascript:void window.open('http://www.starwood-japan.jp/privacy_e/','terms','width=800,height=600,screenX=150,screenY=150,top=150,left=150,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes');">click

<h2>ACCESS TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION:</h2>
<p>
To ensure that your personally identifiable information (PII) is accurate and 
up to date, we encourage you to regularly review and update your information 
as appropriate (e.g., in the event your home or e-mail address changes, or you 
wish to add an additional method for us to communicate with you). If you are a 
Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) program member, you can review and update your 
individual membership profile on-line or with the assistance of a Starwood 
customer service representative. If you are not a SPG program member you can 
review and update your PII by contacting our Consumer Affairs Privacy Office 
and requesting an access form. Please note that in an effort to prevent the 
unauthorized disclosure of your PII, you may be asked to provide proof of 
identity (or other authentication materials) together with the completed 
access request form. Access to PII from non-SPG program members cannot be 
provided by telephone.
</p>
<p>
If, upon review, you wish to deactivate your SPG program member profile, or 
update your PII, we will endeavor to do so in a timely manner. Occasionally, 
information that you request to be removed will be retained in certain files 
for a period of time in order to properly resolve disputes or to troubleshoot 
problems. In addition, some types of information may be stored indefinitely on 
"back up" systems or within log files due to technical constraints, or 
financial or legal requirements. Therefore, you should not always expect that 
all of your PII will be completely removed from our databases in response to 
your request.

<h2>SECURITY SAFEGUARDS:</h2>
<p>
Starwood recognizes the importance of information security, and is constantly 
reviewing and enhancing our technical, physical, and logical security rules 
and procedures.&nbsp;All Starwood owned web sites and servers have security 
measures in place to help protect your personally identifiable information 
against loss, misuse, and alteration while under our control. Although 
"guaranteed security" does not exist either on or off the Internet, we 
safeguard your information using both procedural and technical safeguards, 
including password controls, "firewalls" and the use of up to 128-bit 
encryption based on a Class 3 Digital Certificate issued by VeriSign, Inc.&nbsp; 
This allows for the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption method 
used to help protect your data from interception and hacking while in transit.

<h2>ON-LINE TECHNOLOGIES:</h2>
<p>
Starwood may use cookies, invisible pixels, and web beacons to obtain 
information about you while visiting our web sites. A cookie is a very small 
text file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your 
computer's hard drive. It assigns the computer with a unique identifier, which 
in turn, becomes your identification card whenever you return to a Starwood 
web site.
</p>
<p>
Cookies are designed to save you time because they help us to provide you with 
a customized experience without you having to remind us of your preferences 
each time you return to our web pages. Starwood cookies are not designed to 
damage your files, nor can they read information from other files on your 
computer hard drive.
</p>
<p>
Cookies can also help us provide you with a personalized on-line experience in 
the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
they remember your user name and password for future visits so log-in is 
easier and faster
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
they ensure you are provided with the appropriate frames and content
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
they ensure you obtain all requested information
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
they help us deliver communications that are relevant and responsive to your 
interests and location
</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Starwood cookies are limited to our web sites only, and are not designed to 
follow you when traveling on the Internet after leaving Starwood owned web 
sites. We track the usage of our web sites in order to better meet your needs 
and to help make it easier for you to find information in the future. Please 
note that in addition to Starwood cookies, various third parties may also 
place cookies on your computer's hard drive. Starwood is not responsible for 
the presence or absence of third party cookies, or for the technological 
capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third 
party cookies.
</p>
<p>
If you would prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your Internet browser 
can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the type of 
browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) 
you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis or (ii) 
you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You 
should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your web browser for specific 
details about cookie security. However, you should also understand that 
rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain transactions on 
our web sites and our ability to recognize your browser from one visit to the 
next.
</p>
<p>
Starwood also uses invisible pixels, sometimes called web beacons, to count 
how many people visit certain web pages. Information collected from invisible 
pixels is used and reported in the aggregate and does not contain personally 
identifiable information. Starwood may use this information to improve 
marketing programs and content.

<h2>LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES:</h2>
<p>
In order to anticipate your needs, Starwood provides links to other web sites 
for your convenience and information. Starwood is not responsible or liable 
for any content presented by or contained on any independent web site, 
including, but not limited to, any advertising claims or marketing practices. 
Please note that while Starwood will protect your information on Starwood 
owned and operated web sites, we cannot control and will not be responsible 
for the privacy policies of third party web sites, including web sites owned 
or controlled by independent franchisees, third party owners of hotel, resort, 
interval ownership, or residence properties that may use the name of a 
Starwood brand, or web sites not controlled or authorized by Starwood. Third 
party web sites that are accessed through links on our web sites have separate 
privacy and data collection practices, and security measures. We have no 
responsibility or liability for the practices, policies and security measures 
implemented by third parties on their web sites. We encourage you to contact 
them to ask questions about their privacy practices, policies and security 
measures before disclosing any personally identifiable information. We 
recommend that you review the privacy statements and policies of linked web 
sites to understand how those web sites collect, use and store information.

determine the age of persons who access and use our web sites. If a minor (as
