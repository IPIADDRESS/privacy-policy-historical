From time to time in the future we may offer additional features, services, and promotional opportunities that may require you to submit additional information to participate.<br><br>
								
								<b>Contacting Shmoki</b><br>
								You may also contact Shmoki by filling out and submitting a form through the Site. When you contact Shmoki through a Site, your full name and email address are transmitted to Shmoki. Any other information you choose to include in the form you submit would also be transferred to and stored on Shmoki's servers.<br><br>
								
								<b>Anonymous Information</b><br>
								We also collect "Anonymous Information", such as traffic statistics and general usage patterns regarding page views, dates and times you use the Site, the website that referred you to the Site, and the method by which you accessed the Site, files accessed through the Site, responses sent to the browser, the length of data sent to the browser, and other data used in the communication between browser and Sites.

								<b>Cookies &amp; 3rd Party Advertisements</b><br>
								Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.<br>
								We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.

								<b>How We Use the Information we Collect</b><br>
								We call information you provide that can be used to locate or identify you "Personally Identifiable Information." We use it to provide our Services and to communicate with you regarding such Services. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide information you have requested or products you have purchased (e.g., membership updates, e-mail newsletters), to resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems. We also may use your Personally Identifiable Information: to respond to specific inquiries made by you; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Service; and to customize, measure, and improve our Services, content, and layout. In addition, the Shmoki Network analyzes and uses your Personally Identifiable Information and supplements it with other information we obtain to notify you and target advertising to you regarding special offers, products, services, and information that we think may be of interest to you, and to measure the advertising effectiveness of advertisements on our Sites and Publisher Properties.<br><br>
								
								We use your Anonymous Information for the purposes of system administration, providing certain site functionality and content, targeted advertising, site tracking, and collecting and reporting aggregate usage information. We may combine Anonymous Information with your personally identifiable information to notify you of special offers and target advertising and other content to you.<br><br>
								
								<b>Phishing</b><br>
								We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your username, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Shmoki. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is our top priority. For more information about phishing, you may want to visit the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts phishingalrt.htm<br><br>
								
								<b>Information Sharing</b><br>
								Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties.<br><br>
								
								<b>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</b><br>
								We may choose to disclose some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to the government, law enforcement officials, or private parties if we, in our sole discretion, believe it necessary or appropriate to comply with the law, to respond to legal complaints, to comply with legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the rights of Shmoki or a third party, to ensure the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally questionable activity.<br><br>
								
								<b>Accessing and Changing Your Information</b><br>
								You may always access and modify certain of your Personally Identifiable Information you provide through Shmoki's self-service e-commerce platform by visiting the "sign in" area at the Shmoki Domain.
