This allows us to process your order and submit it to the publisher, and protects you from fraudulent use of your credit card. In case of problems processing your order, we can contact you using this information.

In addition, these evaluations are used for marketing, promotion and other purposes. We will never make available information that allows personal identification of individuals.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b>
<br>
"Cookies" are small data files that are temporarily stored in a designated file in your browser. You can decline cookies at any time if your browser allows you do this.

However, we will only share this information if we are provided with justified and documented indication of abuse of our services.</li>
</ol>
