          	</p>
          <p>DR MyCommerce, Inc., as well as all of its subsidiaries and divisions, (hereinafter "Digital River") 
            require that all of our vendors abide by a code of ethics and performance even if the code is not part 
            of a written contract. Digital River's continuing use of a vendor will be contingent on the vendor's 
            satisfactory compliance with this Code. This Code applies equally if the customer is Digital River or
            a third party. The term Vendor includes suppliers of any product or service, including software contractors
            and sub-contractors. </p>
          <strong class="pad-t-sm-2">Results-</strong>
          	<p>Vendor will strive to finish tasks efficiently in the allotted time and within the allotted budget. </p>
          <strong class="pad-t-sm-2"> Attitude</strong>
          	<p>Vendor will strive to work smoothly with other team members, and help integrate their efforts into
              the project as a whole. Vendor will maintain a good attitude while waiting for the customer to pay for 
              invoices, for example, and will be easy to do business. </p>
          <strong class="pad-t-sm-2">Value</strong>
      		<p>Vendor will strive to deliver work product that is free of defects, adheres to 
              standards, is of a professional quality, and works as expected and agreed upon. </p>
          <strong class="pad-t-sm-2">Planning</strong>
  			<p>Vendor will plan ahead and solve the business problem first, design before 
              developing, and test before deploying. Vendor will document the work product 
              so others can take over the effort should circumstances require. </p>
          <strong class="pad-t-sm-2">Communication</strong>
			<p>Vendor will communicate their status in a timely and regular way on the work product 
              even if it might negatively affect its position. Vendor will notify the relevant parties
              when a project is outside of its area of expertise or skill level, or if a reasonable 
              person who is fully aware of the situation would understand that Vendor needs help to get back on track. </p>
          <strong class="pad-t-sm-2">Integrity</strong>
			<p>Vendor will not knowingly misrepresent facts. Vendor will not knowingly 
              use unlicensed software. Vendor will fully divulge all conflicts of interest prior to 
              contract, or as soon as is reasonably possible after discovery. Vendor will abide by
              the terms of its contracts and the law. Vendor will not divulge (unless required by law)
              or make use of confidential or proprietary information belonging to others. Vendor will
              take care to invoice only for hours actually worked or milestones fully attained. </p>
          <strong class="pad-t-sm-2">Commitment</strong>
			<p>Vendor will demonstrate loyalty to Digital River and not interfere in the 
              relationship of Digital River and any Digital River customer. Vendor will not 
              do anything to disparage the reputation of either himself /herself, Digital River, 
              nor any Digital River customer. </p>
