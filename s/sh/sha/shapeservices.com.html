                about yourself in order to receive or use services on www.shapeservices.com. 
                Such services include receiving newsletters, competitions, registering 
                for events, completing questionnaires, downloading software and

              <p><span class="a_titlemagenta">Updates to this Privacy Policy and 
                Notification of Changes</span><br>
                This policy may change without notice from time to time and we 
                will post these chances to this privacy statement, the homepage, 
                and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware 
                of what information we collect and how we use it.</p>
              <p><span class="a_titlemagenta">The information collected</span><br>
                Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide

                We ask for personal information when you subscribe to our updates/news 
                newsletters and when you want to submit a question about our products/services 
                to our customer support staff. The types of personal information 
                that we may collect on these pages are: name, company name, title, 
                e-mail address and model of your mobile device. </p>
              <p>Registering on SHAPE Services sites is optional. If you choose 
                not to register or provide personal information, you can still 
                use the SHAPE Services website. However, you will not be to receive 
                email alerts. Separately, you may choose to sign-up to receive 
                updates/news information from SHAPE Services by selecting the

                SHAPE Services currently does not have a method for completely

                the cookie stored on your computer will cause you to be perceived

                in your browser, instructing it not to accept cookies, but this 
                could prevent you from receiving some SHAPE Services’ services.</p>
