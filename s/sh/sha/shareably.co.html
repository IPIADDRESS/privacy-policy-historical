					<b>Personal Data Export.</b>
					If we export your personal information from the European Economic Area to a country outside of it and are required to apply additional safeguards to that personal information under European data protection legislation, we will do so.  Such safeguards may include applying the European Commission model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries described <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en#international-data-transfers-using-model-contracts">here</a>. Please <a href="#how-to-contact-us">contact us</a> for further information about any such transfers or the specific safeguards applied.
