                    <h2>Use of your Personal Information</h2>

                    <p> SharpSpring collects and uses your personal information to operate its websites and deliver the
                        services you have requested.
                        SharpSpring may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other
                        products or services available from SharpSpring and its affiliates. SharpSpring may also contact
                        you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new

                    <p><strong>SHARPSPRING DOES NOT SELL, RENT or LEASE its CUSTOMER LISTS TO THIRD PARTIES.</strong></p>

                    <p> SharpSpring may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about
                        a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally
                        identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is transferred to the third
                        party. SharpSpring may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send
                        you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third
                        parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to
                        SharpSpring, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
                        SharpSpring may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within our Sites, in order
                        to determine what SharpSpring services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver
                        customized content and service within SharpSpring to customers whose behavior indicates that
                        they are interested in a particular area.</p>

                    <p> SharpSpring will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so
                        by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: </p>

                        <ul class="disc">
                            <li>conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on SharpSpring or the site; </li>
                            <li>protect and defend the rights or property of SharpSpring; and, </li>
                            <li>act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of SharpSpring, or the public.</li>
                        </ul>


                    <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

                    <p> The SharpSpring website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience.
                        A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be
                        used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
                        and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. In addition,
                        you enable SharpSpring to obtain any other cookies used on your website in conjunction with the
                        SharpSpring service.</p>

                    <p> One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
                        The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
                        example, if you personalize SharpSpring pages, or register with SharpSpring site or services, a
                        cookie helps SharpSpring to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies
                        the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
                        and so on. When you return to the same SharpSpring website, the information you previously
                        provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the SharpSpring features that you customized.</p>


                    <h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>

                    <p> SharpSpring secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
                        We routinely scan our source code to check for weaknesses or vulnerabilities. When personal
                        information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected
                        through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>


                    <h2>Children Under Thirteen</h2>

                    <p> SharpSpring does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under
                        the age of thirteen. If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for
                        permission to use this website.</p>


                    <h2>Opt-Out &amp; Unsubscribe</h2>

                    <p> We respect your privacy and give you an opportunity to opt-out of receiving announcements of
                        certain information. Users may opt-out of receiving any or all communications from SharpSpring
