              any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this

            <p>The Shaw's website contains links to the web sites of sponsors, 
              advertisers and other providers of goods and services of interest 
              to our customers. Shaw's and Star do not provide these companies 
              with your personally identifiable information when you link into 
              their websites from the Shaw's website. When you choose to interact 
              with any Third Party website by purchasing products and services, 
              interacting with an on-line or offline promotion, survey, questionnaire, 
              contest or sweepstakes, remember each website has its own privacy 
              policy, which may or may not be similar to this Shaw's Privacy Policy. 
              At your option, you may choose to supply personally identifiable 
              information to these Third Parties. Shaw's and Star do not assume 
              any responsibility for actions of Third Parties. Any questions you 
              may have regarding any Third Party privacy policy should be directed 
              to that Third Party.</p>
            <p> Shaw's web site may offer the services of Third Parties to purchase 
              groceries at Shaw's and Star or to obtain manufacturer coupons. 
              Shaw's and Star assume no responsibility for the actions of Third 
              Parties with respect to any data that you choose to provide to them 
              in connection with the use of their services to purchase groceries 
              at Shaw's and Star. You should review the privacy policies of Third 
              Parties to learn about their specific practices with respect to 
              their handling of the data that you provide to them.</p>
            <p> Whenever you make purchases at Shaw's and Star using Third Party 
              services Shaw's and Star will provide information to the Third Parties 
              concerning such purchases. Shaw's and Star provide such information 
              solely to enable the Third Parties to complete those purchase transactions. 
              By using Third Parties in connection with such purchases, you authorize 
              Shaw's and Star to provide such information to those Third Parties.</p>
            <p> Often, manufacturers will fund offers that are made available 
              to Shaw's Rewards Cardholders on specific products; however, we 
              do not share personally identifiable information with them. As is 
              described below, we may share aggregate data about our customers' 
              overall purchasing patterns.</p>

            <p class="subtitle"><a name="6"></a>6.0 Collection And Use Of General/Aggregate 
              Information By Shaw's And Star</p>
            <p> In addition to the personally identifiable information and purchase 
              information discussed above, Shaw's and Star collect aggregate information 
              concerning the purchases by all of the people who are Shaw's Rewards 
              Cardholders. On a program-wide basis, Shaw's and Star keep track 
              of the certain types of aggregate statistical information about 
              the Shaw's Rewards Cardholders (for example, amounts and types of 
              groceries purchased by a typical Shaw's or Star customer). Shaw's 
              and Star use this general, anonymous information to obtain a better 
              understanding of Shaw's Rewards Cardholders. This information helps 
              Shaw's and Star to identify the effectiveness of their promotional 
              activities, provide better service to their customers, offer a competitive 
              range of products and new items and pass on savings to customers 
              by operating a more efficient business. Also, we use this information 
              to provide special savings offers such as free samples, coupons, 
              rebates and other promotions to those Shaw's Rewards Cardholders 
              who have elected to receive such offers. If you have elected to 
              receive such offers from us, these offers may be mailed to you at 
              home, sent to you electronically or given to you in store.</p>
            <p> Shaw's and Star share some of the aggregate information described 
              above with Third Parties in order to allow them to measure the effectiveness 
              of programs and advertisements aimed at Shaw's Rewards Cardholders. 
              Such aggregate information will be in the form of grouped statistics. 
              No personally identifiable information is provided to Third Parties 
              with such aggregate information. The procedures for sharing such 
              information with Third Parties are designed to make it impossible 
              for Third Parties to extract personal information from the aggregate 
              information that is provided to them.</p>

            <p class="subtitle"> <a name="7"></a>7.0 Third Party Data Practices</p>
            <p> Occasionally, Third Parties are utilized for the purpose of data 
              verification and supplementation. For example, Shaw's and Star may 
              receive census data files in order to determine the percentage of 
              residents in a select area who own their own homes. Shaw's and Star 
              employ these processes to provide members with offers and content 
              that best meet their specific interests. When Third Parties are 
              employed for such purposes, the confidentiality of members' personal 
              information is maintained in strict conformity with this Privacy 
              Statement.</p>

            <p class="subtitle"> <a name="8"></a>8.0 Your Right To Limit Communications 
              And To Change Your Options</p>
            <p> Shaw's and Star will not send you any e-mail messages, direct 
              mail offers or other communications regarding products or services 
              unless you explicitly ask Shaw's and Star to do so when you apply 
              for your Shaw's Rewards Card. In addition, you can ask Shaw's and 
              Star at any time not to send you such e-mail messages, direct mail 
              offers or other communications. If your cardholder status does not 
              currently call for you to receive such email, direct mail or other 
              communications, you may request at any time to begin receiving such 
              communications.</p>
            <p> If, at any time, you elect not to be a Shaw's Rewards Cardholder, 
              Shaw's and Star will delete your information from its active database. 
              Even though you may have cancelled your membership, residual information 
              remains on the Shaw's and Star archived database and records.</p>

            <p> To safeguard all information that we collect, we have instituted 
              strict physical, electronic, and managerial policies and procedures 
              to prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data accuracy and to 
              ensure the appropriate use of all data. At any time, however, you 
              may request to review or correct your data.</p>
            <p> Shaw's and Star operate secure data networks protected by industry 
              standard "firewalls" and password protection systems that 
              are intended to keep unauthorized persons from accessing the data 
              on the Shaw's/Star network. Only authorized individuals have access 
              to the information provided by Shaw's and Star customers. Each such 
              individual is aware of the Shaw's Privacy Statement and is obligated 
              to keep confidential all customer information in the Shaw's and 
              Star data network.</p>
            <p> Whenever Shaw's and Star handle personal information, they will 
              take steps to ensure your information is treated securely and in 
              accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission 
              over the Internet is ever 100% secure, and so Shaw's and Star cannot 
              warrant the security of the information you transmit to us. Shaw's 
              and Star do, however, make a best effort to ensure the security 
              of the Shaw's/Star system. We have established a Data Privacy Committee, 
              which meets periodically to review matters related to data privacy 
              and security.</p>
