<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the SharesPost <a href="/legal/terms-of-use/" target="_blank">User Agreement</a>. The term “<strong>SharesPost</strong><strong> Financial</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” and “<strong>us</strong>” includes SharesPost Financial Corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries. The Privacy Policy explains how SharesPost may:</p>

<ul><li>collect,</li><li>use, and</li><li>disclose</li></ul>

<h2>From Third Parties</h2>
<p>We may collect information from our vendors and service providers who provide the Service functionality and other services for us. For example, we may collect information about your account profile and investment activity from the vendors we use to provide the Service functionality. We may obtain information from third parties, such as consumer reporting agencies, to verify the information you provide and determine whether you qualify to use certain parts of the Service. For example, we may use fraud screening services to verify that your provided information matches the bank account information on file with the bank. We may also collect your credit history and credit score from consumer reporting agencies.</p>

<h2>Using Cookies, Automatic Data Collection, and Related Technologies</h2>
<p>The Service collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you use it, including anonymous usage statistics. We may correlate such usage statistics with your Personal Information.</p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we and our third-party service providers receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, and from cookies and similar technology. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Service may not work properly.</p>
<p>By using the Service, you are authorizing us to gather, parse, and retain data related to the provision of the Service.</p>

<h2>How SharesPost Uses Your Information</h2>

<p>We may use aggregate information for any purpose.</p>

<h2>Internal and Service-Related Usage</h2>
<p>We use information, including Personal Information, for internal and service-related purposes and may provide it to third parties to allow us to facilitate the Service. We may use and retain any data we collect to provide and improve our services.</p>

<h2>Information Validation and Assessment</h2>
<p>We may use the information you provide to assess its accuracy and your financial condition, including by performing credit checks.</p>

<h2>Communications</h2>
<p>We may send email to the email address or call you at the telephone number you provide to us for informational and operational purposes, such as to provide updates about the Service and perform customer service.</p>

<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>We may use information, including Personal Information, to provide online advertising on the Service from us and our partners and to facilitate transmittal of information we think may be useful or relevant to you.</p>

<h2>Aggregate Data</h2>
<p>We may anonymize and aggregate data collected through the Service and use it for any purpose.</p>

<h2>SharesPost May Disclose Your Information</h2>
<p>We may share your information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>with our third-party service providers;</li>
	<li>for fraud and misconduct prevention;</li>
	<li>to comply with legal obligations;</li>
	<li>to protect and defend our rights and property; and</li>
	<li>with your permission</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not rent, sell, or share Personal Information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes, unless we have your permission or pursuant to a joint marketing agreement with a financial institution.</p>

<h2>We Use Vendors and Service Providers</h2>
<p>We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers retained in connection with the provision of the Service, including third parties that service, maintain, or process transactions and accounts and perform financing, insuring, sale, securitization, assignment, marketing, or other transfers of assets. For example, when you choose to use the NASDAQ Private Market website as part of our services, we may share information about you with NASDAQ Private Market to provide you the service.</p>

<h2>Fraud and Misconduct Prevention</h2>
<p>To protect you and us from fraud or other misconduct and to validate the information you have provided to us, we may share information about you with third parties, such as consumer reporting agencies and information verification services, to verify the information you provide. We also may report any debit balance or negative credit information pertaining to your account with consumer and securities credit reporting agencies.</p>

<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>We do not rent, sell, or share Personal Information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes, unless we have your permission or for joint marketing pursuant to joint marketing agreements with financial institutions. We may allow access to other data collected by the Service to enable the delivery of online advertising on or off this Service or to otherwise facilitate transmittal of information we think may be useful or relevant to you.</p>

<h2>Affiliated Companies</h2>
<p>We may share any information, including Personal Information, with affiliates and subsidiaries, as permitted by law or with your consent.</p>

<h2>As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures</h2>
<p>We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; respond to your requests; or protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety.</p>

<h2>Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers</h2>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of SharesPost’s assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. We cannot control how such entities may use or disclose such information.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your Personal Information with your permission.</p>

<h2>You May Limit Our Information Sharing</h2>
<p>You may prevent us from sharing the Personal Information we have collected about you with non-affiliated third parties in certain circumstances. You may not limit the sharing of Personal Information for the purposes of providing the Service, our everyday business purposes, our own marketing, or for joint marketing efforts with other financial companies.</p>
<p>Under the law, you may opt out of our sharing of the Personal Information that we have obtained from third parties, such as your credit reports, with our affiliates, but you may not opt out of our sharing of information we collect related to your transactions and experiences using the Service. You may also opt out of our sharing of Personal Information about you to affiliates and non-affiliates so that they can market to you. We do not currently share the information as described in this paragraph with affiliates or non-affiliates. Therefore, there is no need at this time for you to opt out or take any other steps to prevent such sharing.</p>

<h2>Information Retention</h2>
<p>We may be required to keep different types of information for varying periods of time according to government regulations and best practices. For example, to comply with regulations imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we may need to keep information for three to six years. We may keep some information longer to meet our needs and those of our customers, even after you close your account.</p>

<h2>Information Security</h2>
<p>We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.</p>
<p>By using the Service or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Service. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the Service or sending an email to you.
