<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>
Date Last Revised:
<time>April, 2009</time>
</h2>
</hgroup>
<p>At SharesPost, our most important asset is our relationship with you.</p>
<p>SharesPost is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of any personal information about our users. We are proud of our privacy practices and the strength of our site security and want you to know how we protect your information and use it to provide to you the service on SharesPost (the “Service”).</p>
<p>SharesPost stresses its privacy and security standards to guard against identity theft and provide security for your registration information and other data. We also re-evaluate our privacy and security policies and adapt them as necessary to deal with new challenges.</p>
<h2>1. We limit the collection and use of personal information</h2>
<p>In order to use the Service, you need to register and in so doing, to provide a Login ID in the form of an email address, a password and your zip code. SharesPost makes every effort to allow you to retain the anonymity of your personal identity and you are free to choose a Login ID email address and password that keeps your personal identity anonymous. Additionally, in order to enjoy the full benefits of the Service you need to register as a Member, rather than a Visitor, and will provide certain, additional information in connection with registering as a Member. All information you provide as a User (whether a Visitor or a Member) is referred to collectively as the “Registration Information”.</p>
<p>Access to your Registration Information is strictly restricted to SharesPost employees and contractors, as needed, in order to operate, develop or improve the Service. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations. They may be subject to discipline, including termination and prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<p>SharesPost requires a Login ID email address from you in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration for the Service;</li>
<li>Registration for any SharesPost Comunications;</li>
<li>The use of any Forums on SharesPost; and</li>
<li>To respond to any correspondence, such as emails or letters, from you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Your Registration Information is kept private</h2>
<p>SharesPost does not sell or rent your Registration Information.</p>
<p>SharesPost uses your Registration Information only as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>to analyze site usage and improve the Service;</li>
<li>to deliver to you any administrative notices, alerts and communications relevant to your use of the Service;</li>
<li>to fulfill your requests for certain products and services;</li>
<li>for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity;</li>
<li>to enforce SharesPost’s Terms of Use; and</li>
<li>as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that you access the Service as brought to you by one of our co-brand partners, through a co-branded URL, your email address used for Registration on the Service, may be provided to such co-brand partner.</p>
<p>If your Zip Code is requested by us, we only use your Zip Code to improve your experience. For example, SharesPost may need to determine the appropriate time zone in order to send you timely alerts as part of the Service.</p>
<h2>3. Changes to your Registration Information</h2>
<p>If your registration information changes during your subscription to SharesPost, you may update the email address and Zip code by emailing us at <a href="mailto:compliance@sharespost.com">compliance@sharespost.com</a> and providing us with your new information.</p>
<h2>4. Registration Information and Third Parties</h2>
<p>As described in the Terms of Use and with your consent, SharesPost may from time to time connect electronically to third parties in order to provide certain features of the Service to you. Your Registration Information or other information is shared with such third parties only if necessary, and only where such third parties abide by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>5. Anonymous or Aggregated Transaction Data</h2>
<p>SharesPost does not sell, rent or disclose your personal Registration Information. SharesPost discloses your Registration Information only to you and to third-parties who help SharesPost provide the Service to you.</p>
<p>SharesPost may anonymize or aggregate transaction data derived from the operation of the Service and disclose such data only in a non-personally identifiable manner to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes (such as how many users clicked on a particular offer);</li>
<li>Organizations approved by SharesPost who conduct research into consumer spending.</li>
<li>Users of the Service for purposes of comparison of their personal situation relative to the broader community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such information does not identify you individually.</p>
<h2>6. Online session information and use is only used to improve your experience</h2>
<p>When you visit SharesPost, we may collect technical and navigational information, such as computer browser type, Internet protocol address, pages visited, and average time spent on our Web site. This information may be used, for example, to alert you to software compatibility issues, or it may be analyzed to improve our Web design and functionality.</p>
<p>We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us measure the performance of our online campaigns or analyze visitor activity on SharesPost. We may permit these service providers to use cookies and other technologies to perform these services for SharesPost. We do not share any personally identifiable information about our customers with these third party service providers, and these service providers do not collect such information on our behalf. Our third party service providers are required to comply with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>7. Offers from external service providers</h2>
<p>There may be separate products and services offered by third parties advertised by us on our site and through the Service that may be complementary to your use of SharesPost and these constitute offers or ways to save. If you choose to use these separate products or services, disclose information to the providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. You should evaluate the practices of external services providers before deciding to use their services. These third party Web sites may have different privacy policies than SharesPost and SharesPost is not responsible for their privacy practices. If you click on a link to a third party Web site, SharesPost encourages you to check the privacy policy of that Web site.</p>
<p>SharesPost may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed and whether any action has been taken on a third party Web site. We use this information to improve the quality of the offers and customized content on the Service.</p>
<h2>8. Bulletin Boards, Blogs and other Forums on SharesPost</h2>
<p>If you use a bulletin board, blog, chat room or other forum on the SharesPost website, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
<h2>9. Surveys</h2>
<p>From time to time, SharesPost may ask you to participate in surveys designed to help SharesPost improve the Web site. Any information provided to SharesPost in connection with any survey will be used only in relation to that survey.</p>
<p>SharesPost may aggregate survey data and disclose such data only in aggregate and in a non-personally identifiable manner to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes;</li>
<li>Users of the Service for purposes of comparison of their personal situation relative to the broader community.</li>
<li>Such information does not identify you individually.</li>
</ul>
<h2>10. Disclosure of your information to protect our rights or if required by law</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding any of the foregoing or any other provision contained herein, SharesPost reserves the right (and you authorize SharesPost) to share or disclose your Registration Information or other information, if SharesPost determines, in its sole discretion, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if you are or may be violating this Privacy Policy or SharesPost’s Terms of Use;</li>
<li>Such disclosure is necessary to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; or</li>
<li>Such disclosure is necessary or required by any applicable law, rule regulation, subpoena or other legal process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>11. Your information may be transferred upon acquisition of SharesPost in accordance with this policy</h2>
<p>Registration Information and other information you have provided may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization or other transfer (a “Transfer”) involving SharesPost. SharesPost specifically reserves the right to transfer such information to a third party in connection with a Transfer. Should such a Transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your information, as and to the extent required by applicable law and require that you receive notice if your information could be used contrary to this policy.</p>
<h2>12. You can transport or delete your data</h2>
<p>Your information is yours. You can remove it anytime you want. When you request us to delete your account for the Service, your information will be permanently expunged from our primary production servers and further access to your account will not be possible. We will also disconnect any connection we had established to your Registration Information. However, portions of your information, may remain on our production servers indefinitely. Your data may also remain on a backup server or media. SharesPost keeps these backups to ensure our continued ability to provide the Service to you in the event of malfunction or damage to our primary production servers.</p>
<h2>13. Cookies and Web Beacons may be used to analyze site usage and improve the Service</h2>
<p>“Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that are inserted and stored by your Web browser on your computer’s hard drive. SharesPost may set and access cookies on your computer to track and store preferential information about you. SharesPost may gather anonymous information about you through cookie technology on an aggregate level only. For example, SharesPost may assign a cookie to you, to limit the amount of times you see a particular offer or to help better determine which offers to serve to you. Please note that most Internet browsers will allow you to stop cookies from being stored on your computer and to delete cookies stored on your computer. If you choose to eliminate cookies, the full functionality of the Service may be impaired for you.</p>
<p>We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.</p>
<p>Web beacons are images embedded in a Web page or email for the purpose of measuring and analyzing site usage and activity. SharesPost, or third party service providers acting on our behalf, may use Web beacons to help us analyze site usage and improve the Service.</p>
<h2>14. Your information is secure and only seen by you</h2>
<p>Your information is yours and only you (through your registration and use of your password) have access to your information on the Service.</p>
<p>We may use a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect SharesPost accounts and systems from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>When you register for the Service, SharesPost requires a password from you for your privacy and security. SharesPost uses industry-standard 128 bit secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect data transmissions between your browser and our servers, such as your Registration Information.</p>
<p>You must log out each time you have finished accessing your SharesPost account.</p>
<h2>15. We use authentication to ensure that only you access your account</h2>
<p>Authentication is the process you go through on SharesPost to access secure areas of our Website. This process takes place when you log into your account, the two key components of which are your Login ID and Password.</p>
<p>With regards to passwords, we maintain strict rules to help prevent others from guessing your password. We also recommend that you change your password periodically. Your password must be 6-8 characters in length. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Login ID and Password. You may not provide these credentials to any third party. If you believe that they have been stolen or been made known to others, you must contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:compliance@sharespost.com">compliance@sharespost.com</a> to request a change. We are not responsible if someone else accesses your account through Registration Information they have obtained from you or through a violation by you of this Privacy Policy or SharesPost’s Terms of Use.</p>
<p>If you have a security related concern, please contact us at <a href="mailto:compliance@sharespost.com">compliance@sharespost.com</a>. We will work closely with you to ensure a rapid and personal response to your concerns.</p>
<h2>16. We will notify you of any changes in this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will update the date upon which this policy, including those changes became effective from at the top of this policy and post those changes to this policy, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time.</p>
<h2>17. Former Users</h2>
<p>If you are a former User (whether Visitor and/or Member), we treat your information in the same manner that we treat information about our current users.</p>
<h2>18. Contact us if you have any questions or concerns</h2>
<p>If you have questions, comments, concerns or feedback regarding this Privacy Policy, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:compliance@sharespost.com">compliance@sharespost.com</a>.</p>
