		<li>with your permission</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We do not rent, sell, or share Personal Information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes, unless we have your permission or pursuant to a joint marketing agreement with a financial institution.</p>
	<h5>WE USE VENDORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS</h5>
	<p>We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers retained in connection with the provision of the Service, including third parties that service, maintain, or process transactions and accounts and perform financing, insuring, sale, securitization, assignment, marketing, or other transfers of assets.</p>
	<h5>FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT PREVENTION</h5>
	<p>To protect you and us from fraud or other misconduct and to validate the information you have provided to us, we may share information about you with third parties, such as consumer reporting agencies and information verification services, to verify the information you provide. We also may report any debit balance or negative credit information pertaining to your account with consumer and securities credit reporting agencies.</p>
	<h5>MARKETING</h5>
	<p>We do not rent, sell, or share Personal Information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes, unless we have your permission or for joint marketing pursuant to joint marketing agreements with financial institutions. We may allow access to other data collected by the Service to enable the delivery of online advertising on or off this Service or to otherwise facilitate transmittal of information we think may be useful or relevant to you.</p>
	<h5>AFFILIATED COMPANIES</h5>
	<p>We may share any information, including Personal Information, with affiliates and subsidiaries, as permitted by law or with your consent.</p>
	<h5>AS REQUIRED BY LAW AND SIMILAR DISCLOSURES</h5>
	<p>We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; respond to your requests; or protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety.</p>
	<h5>MERGER, SALE, OR OTHER ASSET TRANSFERS</h5>
	<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of SharesPost’s assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. We cannot control how such entities may use or disclose such information.</p>
	<p>We may also disclose your Personal Information with your permission.</p>
	<h5>YOU MAY LIMIT OUR INFORMATION SHARING</h5>
	<p>You may prevent us from sharing the Personal Information we have collected about you with non- affiliated third parties in certain circumstances. You may not limit the sharing of Personal Information for the purposes of providing the Service, our everyday business purposes, our own marketing, or for joint marketing efforts with other financial companies.</p>
	<p>Under the law, you may opt out of our sharing of the Personal Information that we have obtained from third parties, such as your credit reports, with our affiliates, but you may not opt out of our sharing of information we collect related to your transactions and experiences using the Service. You may also opt out of our sharing of Personal Information about you to affiliates and non-affiliates so that they can market to you. We do not currently share the information as described in this paragraph with affiliates or non-affiliates. Therefore, there is no need at this time for you to opt out or take any other steps to prevent such sharing.</p>
	<h5>INFORMATION RETENTION</h5>
	<p>We may be required to keep different types of information for varying periods of time according to government regulations and best practices. For example, to comply with regulations imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we may need to keep information for three to six years. We may keep some information longer to meet our needs and those of our customers, even after you close your account.</p>
	<h5>INFORMATION SECURITY</h5>
	<p>We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.</p>
	<p>By using the Service or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Service. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the Service or sending an email to you.

	<h2><a id="account-open-disclosures"></a>ACCOUNT OPEN DISCLOSURES</h2>
	<p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT</p>
	<p>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.</p>
	<p>This notice answers some questions about SharesPost Financial Corporation’s Customer Identification Program.</p>
	<p><i>What types of information will I need to provide?</i></p>
	<p>When you open an account, your firm is required to collect the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Name</li>
		<li>Date of birth</li>
		<li>Address</li>
		<li>Identification number:
			<ul>
				<li>U.S. citizen: taxpayer identification number (Social Security number or employer identification number)</li>
				<li>Non-U.S. citizen: taxpayer identification number; passport number and country of issuance; alien identification card number; or government-issued identification showing nationality, residence and a photograph of you.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You may also need to provide your driver’s license or other identifying documents.</p>
	<p>A corporation, partnership, trust or other legal entity may need to provide other information, such as its principal place of business, local office, employer identification number, certified articles of incorporation, government-issued business license, a partnership agreement or a trust agreement.</p>
	<p>U.S. Department of the Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission, FINRA and New York Stock Exchange rules already require you to provide most of this information. These rules also may require you to provide additional information, such as your net worth, annual income, occupation, employment information, investment experience and objectives, and risk tolerance.</p>
	<p><i>What happens if I don’t provide the information requested or my identity can’t be verified?</i></p>
	<p>SharesPost Financial Corporation may not be able to open an account or carry out transactions for you. If your firm has already opened an account for you, they may have to close it.</p>
	<p><strong>We thank you and appreciate your support of the financial industry’s efforts to deny terrorists and money launderers access to America’s financial system.</strong></p>

	<p>We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business.  In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.  
	Our business continuity plan addresses: data back-up and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their securities if we are unable to continue our business. 
	Our electronic hosting and compliance providers back up our important records in a geographically separate area. While every emergency situation poses unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, we have been advised by these service providers that their objective is to restore their own operations within one hour.  Facilitating your transactions could be delayed during and following this period.</p>
	<h5>Varying Disruptions:</h5>
	<p>Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the business district where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region.  Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe.  In a disruption to only our firm or a building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect to recover and resume business within one hour.  In a disruption affecting our business district, city, or region, we will transfer our operations to a site outside of the affected area, and recover and resume business within six hours.  In either situation, we plan to continue in business, and notify you through our web site at www.sharespost.com, on how to contact us. If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will notify you as soon as quickly as practicable.</p>
