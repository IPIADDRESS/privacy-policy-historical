</h1>
                            <p>DHL, our carrier, will send a text message (SMS) to your mobile to inform you when they’ll be delivering your order 1 or 2 days in advance. If you know you won’t be at home to take delivery, please contact them on the number included in the SMS.  <br><br>

If you are unable to let them know and you are out when they try to deliver your order, DHL will leave a note saying that they called but there was nobody at home. DHL will also try to contact you again to arrange another delivery time.  <br><br>

Following a second unsuccessful delivery attempt, you must contact DHL in order to find out what to do.
