	<strong><font size="+1" color="#666666">Common Questions from Shoppers</font></strong><p>

<b>What is mystery shopping? How much can I earn? What are the requirements? How much do assignments pay?</b><br>
All of these questions and more are answered in our <i>Mystery Shopping 101</i> article. <a href="university_101.cfm">Click here</a> to find out more about mystery shopping in general.</p><p>

<b>I can't remember my password. What do I do?</b><br>
Simply click on the "forget password?" link at the top of any page on the website. A small popup window will appear. Type in your email address and hit submit and your password will be emailed to you immediately.</p><p>

<a name="login"></a>
<b>I can't log in to the site. Help!</b><br>
First of all, make sure that you have typed in your email address and password correctly. It's important that you enter your password exactly the same as when you registered. Passwords are case sensitive so 'PASSWORD' is not the same as 'PassWord' or 'password.' If in doubt, use the "Forgot password" link located on the top right of every page to have it emailed to you.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, the ShadowShopper site uses "cookies" to make the site easier to use. You MUST enable "cookies" on your web browser in order to use the site. You'll know you're logged in by looking at the upper right corner of the screen. If you see "You are logged in as "YOUR NAME" you're all set.</p><p>

<a name="apply"></a>
<b>How do I apply for jobs?</b><br>
You can either click on the link at the bottom of the email notifications we send you, or you can go to the search for jobs page. The search for jobs page will bring up a list of assignments in your area. You then can click on the job and a job details page will pop up (Silver and Gold members only). At the bottom of the job details page is an apply button (again for Silver and Gold members only). Click this and write your message to the employer and hit submit. That's all there is to it! </p><p>

<a name="notify"></a>
<b>I'm no longer receiving job notifications in my email. What happened?</b><br>
If we send you 3 or more emails that are returned as undeliverable, we are required to turn your job notification preference to 'off'. Returned emails can be caused by either having a full mailbox (over your disk space limit) or by mis-indentifying the job notification emails as spam with some spam-blocking software. To turn the notification feature back on, simply log into the site and go to the "My Preferences page." From there, click 'Yes' on the option that says 'Send automatic job notification emails to my inbox' and click the button that says 'Click Here to Update.'</p><p>

<a name="weare"></a>
<b>I applied for a job but never heard back from you. Why?</b><br>
Remember, we are NOT a mystery shopping company. We are a mystery shopping matching company. We DO NOT hire shoppers, our members (mystery shopping companies, merchandising companies, etc.) do. We send you the job opportunities and give you information about how to win assignments. Make sure to <a href="university_tour.cfm">take our tour</a> and read our article on <a href="university_win_assignment.cfm">how to win assignments</a>.</p><p>

<b>What is your phone number so I can call you with my questions?</b><br>
We do not offer phone support. Instead, we handle all support requests and questions via email only. We do this to keep our costs down and so we have a record of members questions and comments. This is pretty common for sites with a large amount of members, such as eBay, Amazon, MSN, AOL any many others.</p><p>

<b>I'm a little skeptical. How do I know you're a real company and not a scam?</b><br>
The truth of the matter is nothing we write actually proves that we're real, and not a scam. We can tell you that we were just voted the top referral service of the year for 2003 by the National Center for Professional Mystery Shopping and Merchandising, have been in business since 2001, have several tens of thousands of members, are located in a real office in Houston, Texas and have 7 employees. </p><p>

<a name="altpay"></a> 
<b>I want to join but I don't want to enter my credit card information online. Can I pay another way?</b><br>
Yes you can. We currently have two alternate payment options. Both require that you sign up for our free Bronze membership first so that all your information will be in our system. Then, when we have receipt of funds, we'll upgrade your account and notify you.</p><p>

NOTE: We process all checks and money orders the day we receive them and notify you immediately. Please don't email asking if we've received your check until you've allowed 10 days for us to receive payment. Thank you!</p><p>
 

<i>Paying via PayPal</i><br>
Send your payment to paypal@shadowshopper.com. In the notes section please include the email address you used when you signed up on ShadowShopper so we know which account to update.</p><p>
 
<i>Paying by Check or Money Order </i><br>
Mail your payment to the following address and include your name and email address.</p><p>

ShadowShopper<br>
21175 Tomball Parkway, Suite 387<br>
Houston, TX 77070</p><p>
 
<b>Do Gold members really get opportunities to get paid to mystery shop a cruise?</b><br>
YES! ShadowShopper exclusively offers mystery shopping cruise jobs regularly to our Gold and Lifetime members. We do this through partnerships we've established with several major luxury cruise lines to help them improve their customer's experience onboard. Additionally, our members may be chosen to mystery shop the services and shops onboard during the cruise. <a href="university_cruise.cfm">Click here</a> to learn more about these exciting opportunities.</p><p>

We're currently investigating additional job opportunities for our Gold and Lifetime members to mystery shop casinos, vacation packages, sporting events and much more. We'll notify all our members as these new partnerships take effect.</p><p>

<b>A friend of mine told me that I shouldn't have to pay to mystery shop. Why should I pay to join?</b><br>
We agree that you shouldn't have to pay to mystery shop; and that's not why we charge a membership fee. What we do is bring the mystery shopping opportunities to you and that is what we charge you for. Our hundreds of employers post thousands of jobs to our site each month. We search for the jobs you want, in your area, and deliver those jobs straight to your email inbox. That's why thousand of shoppers are using us to do the hard work of finding the best mystery shopping jobs nationwide. You concentrate on enjoying the opportunities to get paid to eat and shop, and leave the searching to us. You can spend a large amount of your free time searching for jobs or, for the monthly equivalent of a meal at McDonald's, you can pay ShadowShopper to do all the time-consuming work for you.</p><p>

<b>Aren't all of the jobs on your site posted on various free job boards?</b><br>
NO! In fact, we have dozens and dozens of individual employers that exclusively post thousands of mystery shopping jobs on ShadowShopper and nowhere else. This includes our exclusive cruise line mystery shopping jobs right now; and in the months to come we expect to add casino, vacation, sporting event and many more premium mystery shopping jobs. We're constantly adding more and more employers each month. Many of whom are choosing to only post at ShadowShopper. Some of our employers do post their jobs outside of ShadowShopper on free job boards. But don't you have better things to do with your time than to spend an hour or more every night searching for jobs you want? Instead, why not leave it up to us to email these very same jobs directly to you.</p><p>

<b>You've sent me jobs that aren't what I thought were mystery shopping jobs. What gives?</b><br>
Our employers have jobs that aren't just mystery shopping but also include product demonstrations, evaluations, testing and more. Sometimes the jobs won't have much to do with shopping. But that's the type of variety we get at ShadowShopper. With hundreds of employers nationwide, the jobs change constantly, and can vary from the type that you're seeing to restaurant evaluations, testers, shopping assignments, video shops, and many others. Give the site a little time and you'll be pleasantly surprised at the variety of opportunities we can provide to you. Keep in mind that you can easily change your shopping preferences so that you'll only get the exact type of jobs you want.</p><p>

<b>Why should I do non-mystery shopping jobs?</b><br>
One thing to consider is that while non-mystery shopping jobs don't sound as glamorous, taking a few of them, doing a great job, and getting known for your quality of performance is a great way to ensure that when those plum jobs come up, the employer will recognize your name and say "that's the shopper we need!" Still, it's up to you, and it's your valuable time, so do what you think is best.</p><p>
	
<a name="bronze"></a>	
<b>I'm a Bronze member. Why can't I see job details or apply?</b><br>
We allow you to see partial views of jobs in your area as a way of showing you that the ShadowShopper system really works. When you upgrade to Gold or Silver membership you'll see the complete view and you can act on the individual jobs. We have to charge for memberships in order to be able to provide this valuable service to you. Bronze members cannot apply for these jobs using our system. Bronze members can, however, be directly contacted by employers by having their profile in our system.</p><p>
	
<b>I received a job posting from ShadowShopper but when I tried to view the Job Details, it said there were no details to view. What happened to the assignment?</b><br>
This means that the assignment is no longer available. This could be for several reasons, the employer made a mistake in the posting and deleted it, the job may have already been filled or they may have suspended the job after receiving a certain number of email responses from interested shoppers.</p><p>

<a name="cert"></a> 
<b>What is my Silver or Gold certification number?</b><br>
We do not issue certification numbers for either our memberships or our CertiShop certification. Many times people confuse our memberships and certification with the MSPA's Silver and Gold Shopper Certification (note: we have Silver and Gold membership levels - not certifications). We are not affiliated with the MSPA and do not know if you have certification with the MSPA. Our CertiShop certification test is free for our members. The MSPA charges $15 on up for it's certification tests.</p><p>

<b>How long are the jobs posted on the site?</b><br>
Employers are responsible for their own job postings. The postings can only stay on our site for a maximum of 90 days. Most employers have a time frame that they leave the jobs open. For example: A job may be posted on the 10th of the month with a closing date of the 30th of that month. They will set the job up to automatically expire on the 30th. Some employers may delete the job on 20th if they fill it, or simply let the job expire on the 30th allowing them to continue to receive notification of interested shoppers in case the original shopper fails to perform the shop.</p><p>

<b>Does ShadowShopper post international shops?</b><br>
Currently, we do not have any international shops posted. However, we do plan to include international shoppers early next year. </p><p>
<a name="privacy_policy"></a>

<b>How do I cancel my membership?</b><br>
You can cancel your membership by either going to the Account Information page located at <a href="https://www.shadowshopper.com/myshadowshopper_shopper_account_information.cfm">https://www.shadowshopper.com/myshadowshopper_shopper_account_information.cfm</a> (NOTE: you must be logged in to get to this page) under Membership Cancellation, or by emailing us a request to cancel your membership and we will do it for you. In either event our system will send you a dated email confirmation for your records.</p><p>

	<strong><font size="+1" color="#666666">Common Questions from Shoppers</font></strong><p>

<b>What is mystery shopping? How much can I earn? What are the requirements? How much do assignments pay?</b><br>
All of these questions and more are answered in our <i>Mystery Shopping 101</i> article. <a href="university_101.cfm">Click here</a> to find out more about mystery shopping in general.</p><p>

<b>I can't remember my password. What do I do?</b><br>
Simply click on the "forget password?" link at the top of any page on the website. A small popup window will appear. Type in your email address and hit submit and your password will be emailed to you immediately.</p><p>

<a name="login"></a>
<b>I can't log in to the site. Help!</b><br>
First of all, make sure that you have typed in your email address and password correctly. It's important that you enter your password exactly the same as when you registered. Passwords are case sensitive so 'PASSWORD' is not the same as 'PassWord' or 'password.' If in doubt, use the "Forgot password" link located on the top right of every page to have it emailed to you.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, the ShadowShopper site uses "cookies" to make the site easier to use. You MUST enable "cookies" on your web browser in order to use the site. You'll know you're logged in by looking at the upper right corner of the screen. If you see "You are logged in as "YOUR NAME" you're all set.</p><p>

<a name="apply"></a>
<b>How do I apply for jobs?</b><br>
You can either click on the link at the bottom of the email notifications we send you, or you can go to the search for jobs page. The search for jobs page will bring up a list of assignments in your area. You then can click on the job and a job details page will pop up (Silver and Gold members only). At the bottom of the job details page is an apply button (again for Silver and Gold members only). Click this and write your message to the employer and hit submit. That's all there is to it! </p><p>

<a name="notify"></a>
<b>I'm no longer receiving job notifications in my email. What happened?</b><br>
If we send you 3 or more emails that are returned as undeliverable, we are required to turn your job notification preference to 'off'. Returned emails can be caused by either having a full mailbox (over your disk space limit) or by mis-indentifying the job notification emails as spam with some spam-blocking software. To turn the notification feature back on, simply log into the site and go to the "My Preferences page." From there, click 'Yes' on the option that says 'Send automatic job notification emails to my inbox' and click the button that says 'Click Here to Update.'</p><p>

<a name="weare"></a>
<b>I applied for a job but never heard back from you. Why?</b><br>
Remember, we are NOT a mystery shopping company. We are a mystery shopping matching company. We DO NOT hire shoppers, our members (mystery shopping companies, merchandising companies, etc.) do. We send you the job opportunities and give you information about how to win assignments. Make sure to <a href="university_tour.cfm">take our tour</a> and read our article on <a href="university_win_assignment.cfm">how to win assignments</a>.</p><p>

<b>What is your phone number so I can call you with my questions?</b><br>
We do not offer phone support. Instead, we handle all support requests and questions via email only. We do this to keep our costs down and so we have a record of members questions and comments. This is pretty common for sites with a large amount of members, such as eBay, Amazon, MSN, AOL any many others.</p><p>

<b>I'm a little skeptical. How do I know you're a real company and not a scam?</b><br>
The truth of the matter is nothing we write actually proves that we're real, and not a scam. We can tell you that we were just voted the top referral service of the year for 2003 by the National Center for Professional Mystery Shopping and Merchandising, have been in business since 2001, have several tens of thousands of members, are located in a real office in Houston, Texas and have 7 employees. </p><p>

<a name="altpay"></a> 
<b>I want to join but I don't want to enter my credit card information online. Can I pay another way?</b><br>
Yes you can. We currently have two alternate payment options. Both require that you sign up for our free Bronze membership first so that all your information will be in our system. Then, when we have receipt of funds, we'll upgrade your account and notify you.</p><p>

NOTE: We process all checks and money orders the day we receive them and notify you immediately. Please don't email asking if we've received your check until you've allowed 10 days for us to receive payment. Thank you!</p><p>
 

<i>Paying via PayPal</i><br>
Send your payment to paypal@shadowshopper.com. In the notes section please include the email address you used when you signed up on ShadowShopper so we know which account to update.</p><p>
 
<i>Paying by Check or Money Order </i><br>
Mail your payment to the following address and include your name and email address.</p><p>

<b><i>IMPORTANT! Remember to signup for a free membership before mailing us so that you're in our system.</i></b></p><p>

ShadowShopper<br>
21175 Tomball Parkway, Suite 387<br>
Houston, TX 77070</p><p>
 
<b>Do Gold members really get opportunities to get paid to mystery shop a cruise?</b><br>
YES! ShadowShopper exclusively offers mystery shopping cruise jobs regularly to our Gold and Lifetime members. We do this through partnerships we've established with several major luxury cruise lines to help them improve their customer's experience onboard. Additionally, our members may be chosen to mystery shop the services and shops onboard during the cruise. <a href="university_cruise.cfm">Click here</a> to learn more about these exciting opportunities.</p><p>

We're currently investigating additional job opportunities for our Gold and Lifetime members to mystery shop casinos, vacation packages, sporting events and much more. We'll notify all our members as these new partnerships take effect.</p><p>

<b>A friend of mine told me that I shouldn't have to pay to mystery shop. Why should I pay to join?</b><br>
We agree that you shouldn't have to pay to mystery shop; and that's not why we charge a membership fee. What we do is bring the mystery shopping opportunities to you and that is what we charge you for. Our hundreds of employers post thousands of jobs to our site each month. We search for the jobs you want, in your area, and deliver those jobs straight to your email inbox. That's why thousand of shoppers are using us to do the hard work of finding the best mystery shopping jobs nationwide. You concentrate on enjoying the opportunities to get paid to eat and shop, and leave the searching to us. You can spend a large amount of your free time searching for jobs or, for the monthly equivalent of a meal at McDonald's, you can pay ShadowShopper to do all the time-consuming work for you.</p><p>

<b>Aren't all of the jobs on your site posted on various free job boards?</b><br>
NO! In fact, we have dozens and dozens of individual employers that exclusively post thousands of mystery shopping jobs on ShadowShopper and nowhere else. This includes our exclusive cruise line mystery shopping jobs right now; and in the months to come we expect to add casino, vacation, sporting event and many more premium mystery shopping jobs. We're constantly adding more and more employers each month. Many of whom are choosing to only post at ShadowShopper. Some of our employers do post their jobs outside of ShadowShopper on free job boards. But don't you have better things to do with your time than to spend an hour or more every night searching for jobs you want? Instead, why not leave it up to us to email these very same jobs directly to you.</p><p>

<b>You've sent me jobs that aren't what I thought were mystery shopping jobs. What gives?</b><br>
Our employers have jobs that aren't just mystery shopping but also include product demonstrations, evaluations, testing and more. Sometimes the jobs won't have much to do with shopping. But that's the type of variety we get at ShadowShopper. With hundreds of employers nationwide, the jobs change constantly, and can vary from the type that you're seeing to restaurant evaluations, testers, shopping assignments, video shops, and many others. Give the site a little time and you'll be pleasantly surprised at the variety of opportunities we can provide to you. Keep in mind that you can easily change your shopping preferences so that you'll only get the exact type of jobs you want.</p><p>

<b>Why should I do non-mystery shopping jobs?</b><br>
One thing to consider is that while non-mystery shopping jobs don't sound as glamorous, taking a few of them, doing a great job, and getting known for your quality of performance is a great way to ensure that when those plum jobs come up, the employer will recognize your name and say "that's the shopper we need!" Still, it's up to you, and it's your valuable time, so do what you think is best.</p><p>
	
<a name="bronze"></a>	
<b>I'm a Bronze member. Why can't I see job details or apply?</b><br>
We allow you to see partial views of jobs in your area as a way of showing you that the ShadowShopper system really works. When you upgrade to Gold or Silver membership you'll see the complete view and you can act on the individual jobs. We have to charge for memberships in order to be able to provide this valuable service to you. Bronze members cannot apply for these jobs using our system. Bronze members can, however, be directly contacted by employers by having their profile in our system.</p><p>
	
<b>I received a job posting from ShadowShopper but when I tried to view the Job Details, it said there were no details to view. What happened to the assignment?</b><br>
This means that the assignment is no longer available. This could be for several reasons, the employer made a mistake in the posting and deleted it, the job may have already been filled or they may have suspended the job after receiving a certain number of email responses from interested shoppers.</p><p>

<a name="cert"></a> 
<b>What is my Silver or Gold certification number?</b><br>
We do not issue certification numbers for either our memberships or our CertiShop certification. Many times people confuse our memberships and certification with the MSPA's Silver and Gold Shopper Certification (note: we have Silver and Gold membership levels - not certifications). We are not affiliated with the MSPA and do not know if you have certification with the MSPA. Our CertiShop certification test is free for our members. The MSPA charges $15 on up for it's certification tests.</p><p>

<b>How long are the jobs posted on the site?</b><br>
Employers are responsible for their own job postings. The postings can only stay on our site for a maximum of 90 days. Most employers have a time frame that they leave the jobs open. For example: A job may be posted on the 10th of the month with a closing date of the 30th of that month. They will set the job up to automatically expire on the 30th. Some employers may delete the job on 20th if they fill it, or simply let the job expire on the 30th allowing them to continue to receive notification of interested shoppers in case the original shopper fails to perform the shop.</p><p>

<b>Does ShadowShopper post international shops?</b><br>
Currently, we do not have any international shops posted. However, we do plan to include international shoppers early next year. </p><p>
