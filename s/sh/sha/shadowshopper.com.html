<p><br><font size="-1">"I was skeptical, but then I started to get all these mystery shopping job emails! I got the first one I applied to, and when I came out of the store after the shop I called my husband and said, 'can you believe someone's finally PAYING ME to do this?'

</p><p><br><font size="-1">"Shadow Shopper has given me a fun new activity but even better I'm making money while I'm at it. BTW my husband says 'thank you' for all the free meals he gets going on restaurant shops with me."

</p><p><br><font size="-1">"Getting paid to eat and shop sounded like a come-on at first, so I've been surprised that I've already gotten a few assignments. It's been a lot of fun, and I'm here to attest to the fact that it's true, you really do get paid to eat and shop! 
</font></p><p><font size="-1">- <em>Samantha, Oregon</em></font>

</p><p><br><font size="-1">"I feel like I'm making a difference when I go on these mystery shopping jobs. If it helps stores and restaurants improve their service, great! And believe me, if the service is lousy, I let them know! If it was great, they need to know that, too."
</font></p><p><font size="-1">- <em>Mary, Kansas</em></font>

</p><p><br><font size="-1">"I have three kids, so I need times to do mystery shops that fit my schedule. With Shadow Shopper that's just what I was able to do. I'm looking forward to when the kids are in school so I can do some of the more advanced, higher paying assignments." 
</font></p><p><font size="-1">- <em>Karen, Ohio</em></font>

</p><p><br><font size="-1">"Several times during my cruise I thought, 'I am seeing three countries and being waited on hand and foot, for free!' I'm still waiting for the 'catch.' But there isn't one."
