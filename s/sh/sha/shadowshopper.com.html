                    <p align="left" class="body9ptTimes">In some areas of our 
                      Web site, Shadow Shopper requests or may request that you 
                      provide personal information, including your name, address, 
                      e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, social 
                      security number, contact information, billing information 
                      and any other information from which your identity is discernible. 
                      In other areas, Shadow Shopper collects or may collect demographic 
                      information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP code, 
                      age, preferences, gender, interests and favorites. Sometimes 
                      we collect or may collect a combination of the two types 
                      of information. Examples of areas on the Shadow Shopper 
                      site where we collect personal or combined personal and 
                      demographic data are pages where you can open a Shadow Shopper 
                      account, sign up to use a service, post a resume, enter 
                      a contest, or purchase a product. In addition, Shadow Shopper 
                      may indirectly collect information about you when you use 
                      certain third party services on our Web site. Such information 
                      will be subject to, and treated in accordance with, the 
                      policies and practices described in this Statement.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="body9ptTimes">We also gather or may 
                      gather certain information about your use of our site, such 
                      as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, 
                      there is information about your computer hardware and software 
                      that is or may be collected by Shadow Shopper. This information 
                      can include without limitation your IP address, browser 
                      type, domain names, access times, and referring Web site 
                      addresses.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="body9ptTimes">Shadow Shopper may sometimes 
                      afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, cultural, 
                      behavioral, preferential and/or life style information about 
                      yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish 
                      such information. If you do provide such information, you 
                      are thereby consenting to the use of that information in 
                      accordance with the policies and practices described in 
                      this Statement. For example, such information may be used 
                      for the purpose of determining your potential interest in 
                      receiving email or other communications about particular 
                      products or services.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="body9ptTimes">Please remember that 
                      if you post any of your personal information in public areas

                      such information may be collected and used by others over

                      is a career site, we give you the option of putting your

                      to paying employers, shoppers, recruiters, hiring managers,

                      database or to obtain a copy of that database, as well as 
                      parties who have otherwise gained access to the database,

                    <p align="left" class="body9ptTimes">Shadow Shopper uses "cookies" 
                      to help personalize and maximize your online experience 
                      and time online. A cookie is a text file that is placed 
                      on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies are not 
                      used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. 
                      Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can 
                      only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the 
                      cookie to you.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="body9ptTimes">One of the primary purposes 
                      of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you 
                      time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server 
                      that you have returned to a specific page. For example, 
                      if you personalize Shadow Shopper pages, or register for 
                      services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information 
                      (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of 
                      our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate 
                      results and a more personalized site experience. When you 
                      return to the Shadow Shopper site, the information you previously 
                      provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features 
                      that you customized.</p>

                      to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically 
                      accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser 
                      setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, 
                      you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify 
                      you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept

                      to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance
