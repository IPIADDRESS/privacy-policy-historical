<h1>Privacy &amp; Security Policy</h1>
</div>
<div class="demo-sep sep-none" style="margin-top: 20px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p>By using this website (the âShaklee Websitesâ) you, the user or distributor as the case may be, (âyouâ) are agreeing to be bound by the current version of the terms of use provided herein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br> Shaklee Corporation (âShaklee,â âwe,â or âourâ) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information we collect from you. &nbsp;Shaklee Corporation is committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br> This Policy explains how Shaklee Corporation collects, uses, stores, shares and protects information, including personal information. Shaklee Corporation is committed to collecting, using, storing, sharing and protecting personal information responsibly. By using Shaklee Corporationâs websites, you consent to the collection of personal information. Information that is provided will only be used, stored and shared for the purposes for which you have consented.&nbsp; This Policy covers both online and offline activities, including information that we collect through our various websites, Distributor events, phone and catalogue orders (among other methods).</p>
<p><strong>Shaklee Corporationâs Collection and Use Of Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>What information do we collect?</strong><br> Depending on how you interact with Shaklee Corporation, we may collect from you various types of information, which are described in more detail below. In some instances (and unless we say otherwise below), we may combine one type of information with another, and store them together in our records. In all cases, however, we strive to limit the amount of information we collect and store to that which is necessary to provide you the relevant services. Shaklee Corporation uses such information for all legal purposes and to provide products and services to you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal Contact information</span><br> Shaklee Corporation collects personally identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, email and telephone numbers (home, cell, etc) entered on Shaklee Corporationâs websites or provided directly to Shaklee Corporation. In some cases, this could include information that you give us about someone else (for example, if you ask us to ship a Shaklee product to a friend). We typically collect personal contact information for registration activities, product orders, customer service, contests and promotions and customer feedback.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Payment information</span><br> This includes any information that you use to make a purchase, such as your credit card details (cardholder name, card number, expiration date, etc.), check or other forms of payment (if such are made available). This also includes the billing name and address associated with your form of payment. We only collect payment information for purchases (whether your purchase is made online, by phone, or via catalogue). If you create an account with us, your payment information (along with your order history and other related preferences) may be stored under your account. To review or edit this information, go to the relevant âMy Accountâ section of our site or contact Customer Service.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Demographic information</span><br> This includes any information that describes your demographic. Examples may include your date of birth, age or age range, gender, general geographic location (e.g., zip code or city and state), favorite products, hobbies and interests, income information or lifestyle information. We typically collect demographic information for registration activities contests and promotions, and customer surveys. For demographic information associated with your profile on a third party social network (e.g., Facebook), see separate paragraph on âSocial network infoâ below. Demographic information may also be used to personalize your experience on our websites. Aggregate information that cannot identify you may be used and disclosed for general business analysis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical computer information</span><br> This includes any information about the computer system or other technological device that you may be using to access one of our websites or applications. We typically collect this information through the use of automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons. Examples of technical computer information may include your computerâs IP address, operating system type, and web browser type. If you access a Shaklee website or application via a mobile device such as a smartphone, the collected information may also include your phoneâs unique device ID, location, and other similar mobile device data. Technical computer information is not typically associated with your personal contact information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Website usage information</span><br> This includes information about how you use and navigate our websites and applications, including which links you click on, which pages or content you view, and other similar information or statistics about your interactions with a Shaklee site or application (e.g., date and time of visit, which site you came from, etc.). This information is captured using automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons, and may be collected regardless of the device you may be using (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.). Website usage information may be associated with your personal contact information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Customer feedback</span><br> This includes information that you voluntarily share with us about your experience in using our products and services, including our websites. Examples may include unsolicited comments and suggestions, testimonials, or other feedback about what you may have liked (or disliked) about your experience in using our products or services. We typically collect this information in the form of customer surveys, feedback forms, and email correspondence.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Customer-generated content</span><br> This refers to any content that you create and then share with us (and perhaps others) by uploading it to one of our websites, including one of our Facebook pages, other social media pages or applications. Examples may include photos, videos, personal stories, or other similar media or content. We mostly collect customer-generated content for contests and promotions, website community features, engagement, and third party social networking.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a name="Social_network"></a>Social network information</span><br> This refers to any information that is part of your profile on a third party social network (such as Facebook) and that you allow the third party social network to share with us. Examples may include your basic account information (e.g., name, email address, profile picture, gender, user ID, list of friends, etc.) and any other additional information or activities that you permit the third party social network to share with its application developers. For example, we may receive your social network information (or parts of it) when you download or interact with a Shaklee application on a social networking site (such as Facebook) or use a third party social networking feature that is integrated within a Shaklee site (such as Facebook Connect). To learn more about how your social network information may be obtained by Shaklee (or other application developers), please visit the website of the relevant third party social network.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other information (depending on context)</span><br> This refers to any other information that we might need to collect for the specific Shaklee form, feature, or other service you are using or requesting. What this information might include will vary depending on the method of collection and the specific purpose(s) for which the information is being collected. Please see <a href="http://www.shaklee.com/us/en/colophon_privacy.shtml#How_do">Section âHow do we use your information?â</a> for more specific examples.</p>
<p><strong>How do we collect your information?</strong><br> We may collect information from you through a variety of online or offline sources, which are described in more detail below. In some instances, we may combine information collected from one source (e.g., a Shaklee website) with information collected from another source (e.g., a Shaklee event or party). We do this to get a more complete view of our members and distributors, which, in turn, allows us to serve you better and with more personalization. Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the methods of collection listed below (and to no other methods). Also note that not all of the methods listed below may be relevant to you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shaklee websites and applications</span><br> We may collect information from you through one of our (U.S. or international) websites or applications. This could include (a) any site that we own and control under our own domain, or (b) any site or application that we may develop and run on a third party social network such as Facebook. This could also include any site or application that we specifically design for use on a cell phone or other mobile device, such as a mobile-enabled site (a.k.a., WAP site) or mobile application.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Text messaging programs</span><br> We may collect information from you through one of our inbound text messaging programs. For example, periodically we may allow customers to send us inbound text messages using a short code that we create and advertise in connection with a special offer or promotion. These programs might be advertised at one of our Distributor events or on one of our websites or applications. If you choose to participate in one of these programs, information about your physical location may be collected and used for marketing purposes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Email correspondence</span><br> We may collect information from you if you correspond with us via email. For example, if you send an email to customer service or use our an âEmail Shakleeâ feature, we may obtain certain information about you (such as your contact email address).</p>
<p>Other sources<br> Occasionally, we may obtain information about you from other sources. For example, we may hire a third party data aggregator to provide us additional information about our existing customers (this is known as âdata appendingâ). We may also receive information from a third party co-sponsor who we may partner with to run a one-time promotion or giveaway.</p>
<p><a name="How_do"></a><strong>How do we use your information?</strong><br> The following describes the various purposes and features for which we might collect and use your information, and the different types of information that might be collected for each. Please note, however, that not all of the uses listed below may be relevant to you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Order fulfillment</span><br> We may collect and use your information to process and ship your orders, and to inform you about the status of your orders. Depending on how you make a purchase, this could involve the collection and use of certain personal contact information, payment information, account login information, and/or information related to your purchase (such as products ordered). This could also involve the ongoing storage of your payment information to allow for easier checkout on future purchases.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Account maintenance</span><br> We may use your information to maintain your accounts with us (including administering any benefits associated with such accounts. This typically involves the use of any information originally collected to set up your account (e.g., personal contact info, payment info, account login info, demographic info, etc.).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Provide Member and Distributor services</span><br> We may collect and use your information to provide you Member and Distributor service, including responses to your inquiries. This typically requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information (such as your name or email address) and information regarding the reason for your inquiry (e.g., order status, technical issue, product question, general question, etc.). This may also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating and managing your accounts</li>
<li>Processing Shaklee Applications</li>
<li>Developing downline genealogy reports</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personalize product recommendations</span><br> We may use your information to provide you with Shaklee product recommendations and offers that are tailored to your interests. This mostly involves the use of your previous order history (e.g., from online and/or offline purchases) and certain demographic information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Website personalization and convenience</span><br> We may collect and use your information to personalize your experience and save you time when you visit our websites. This is typically done through the use of automated technologies (such as cookies) that collect and remember certain account login information, technical information, and/or previous website usage information. For example, we might remember your login ID or username so you can quickly login the next time you visit our site or so you can easily retrieve the items you previously placed in your shopping cart. Based on this type of information, we might also show you specific Shaklee content or offers that are more relevant to your interests.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contests and Promotions</span><br> We may collect and use your information to administer a contest, sweepstakes, giveaway, competition, or other similar marketing campaign or promotion. These events typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (for prize fulfillment), limited demographic information (for eligibility), and, in some cases, customer-generated content. Due to the customer-generated component, some promotions will be run on third party social networks such as Facebook (e.g., on our Facebook fan page or application). To comply with sweepstakes laws, we may publish or share limited information about the winners of a particular promotion.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marketing Communications</span><br> We may collect and use your information to send you marketing communications, such as catalogues, email communications, and SMS text messages. These communications may inform you about new products, events, special discounts, and other news and special offers. Sending you these communications mostly requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information and limited demographic information (such as zip code). In some instances (such as for text messaging programs), this may involve the use of your precise geographical location (obtained from your mobile device) so that we can send you location-based offers. You can always opt-out from receiving marketing emails or text messages by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each such communication. If you have an online account with us, you may be given the option to change your communication preferences under the relevant section of our site or by calling Customer Service.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Social Networking</span><br> We may collect and use your information so we can allow you to interact with online social networking features provided by third party companies such as Facebook.

This exchange of information only occurs when you take some kind of explicit action to permit the sharing (such as clicking on the relevant Facebook feature and creating or logging in to your Facebook account). You can learn more about how these features work by visiting the website of the relevant third party social network.</p>
