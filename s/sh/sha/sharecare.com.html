                        <p>Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect and store your non-personally identifiable information through our websites, and how we use such information:</p> 
                        <ul> 
                          <li><u>Internet Protocol (IP) address</u>.Your "IP address" is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data, such as the screens and pages of our websites that you view.We use this information to deliver our screens and pages to you upon request, to tailor our websites to the interests of you and our other visitors, and to measure traffic to and within our websites. </li> 
 
                          <li><u>Cookie</u>.A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on our websites. For example, when you visit a screen or page on our websites, a cookie is placed on your machine (if you or your browser accept the cookie). This cookie may then be read by screen or pages on our websites.You may configure your browser to notify you or to reject and block cookies, but if you do, you may not have access to some areas of our websites, or to the personalized features of our websites. </li> 
                          <li><u>Web Beacon</u>.A "web beacon", "clear gif", "web bug", or "pixel tag" is a tiny graphic file with a unique identifier, that is similar in function to a cookie, but allows us to count the number of users that have visited certain pages or screens of our websites, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which may be stored on your computer's hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on pages or screens. </li> 
 
                          <li><u>Demographic Information</u>."Demographic information" may be your gender, age, zip code, and interests. We may collect such information about your through our websites and use it to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure that our websites and services and the information on them is targeted to meet your needs. Please note that we also consider aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally identifiable information. </li> 
                        </ul> 
 
                    <p> If you encounter a screen or page that requests information you do not want to share with us, do not enter the information and do not proceed with that screen or page.</p>

                    <p>(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</p> 
                    <p>A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("<strong>California customer</strong>") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.</p> 
 
                    <p>However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy statement) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.</p> 
                    <p>As stated in our <a href="#Privacy_Policy_Statement">privacy policy statement</a>, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting-in to receive information from a third party. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personal information on our website. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third-party's privacy policies and practices. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policies and practices of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.</p> 
                    <p>California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing <a href="mailto:privacy@sharecare.com">privacy@sharecare.com</a>. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.</p>
