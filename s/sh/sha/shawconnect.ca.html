<h4>The Ten Privacy Principles</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Principle 1 – Accountability</h4>
<em><strong>Each Corus Entertainment Company is responsible for the personal information under its control and shall designate one or more individuals who shall be accountable for the company’s compliance with the procedures and principles set out in this Privacy Policy.</strong></em><br><br><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<h4>Principle 3 – Consent</h4>

In certain circumstances, consent with respect to the use or disclosure of personal information may be sought after the information has been collected but before the personal information is used (for example, when a Corus Entertainment Company wants to use information for a purpose not previously identified). In obtaining consent, the Corus Entertainment Companies shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that a customer or employee is advised of the identified purposes for which personal information will be used or disclosed.

For example, a Corus Entertainment Company may collect or use personal information without the knowledge or consent of its employees and/or customers if the collection or use of personal information is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way, such as when the individual is a minor, seriously ill or mentally incapacitated or if seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law. Personal information may also be used or disclosed without the knowledge or consent of the individual in the case of an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened. A Corus Entertainment Company may disclose personal information without knowledge or consent to a lawyer representing the company, to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or as may be otherwise required by law.</td>
