	<p>
		ShareFile is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is 
		to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.  This privacy 
		statement covers the ShareFile domain (www.sharefile.com).  Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to 
		your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance 
		by TRUSTe.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Additionally, ShareFile is committed to adhering to the privacy principles of the Safe Harbor Program administered by the 
		U.S. Dept. of Commerce (<a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">http://export.gov/safeharbor</a>).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This privacy policy was last updated on 9/27/2007.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our support team at 1-800-441-3453 or 
		support@sharefile.com.  If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily 
		addressed within 30 days, you should contact TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php. TRUSTe will 
		then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		At ShareFile, we respect and protect the privacy of our customers and those who use our websites. The following Privacy 
		Statement provides details about how your personal information is collected and used. This privacy statement applies to 
		the products and services that are located on the www.sharefile.com domain. 	
	</p>

	<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
	<p>
		ShareFile is the sole owner of information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to 
		others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. ShareFile collects information from our users at 
		several different points on our website. 
	</p>

	<p>
		In order to use ShareFile, companies must complete a registration process either on our web site or via telephone or 
		email.  During registration, you must provide contact information (such as name and email address) for at least one person 
		at your company. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed 
		interest.  Often, credit card information is also required during registration. If you do not want to provide your credit 
		card information, ShareFile allows you to sign up for a free trial by calling us at 1-800-441-3453 or sending an email 
		request to support@sharefile.com. ShareFile also has an invoice billing option for companies that are not able to provide 
		credit card information.
	</p>

	<p>		
		ShareFile reserves the right to contact users who sign up for a free trial, or begin the signup process for a free trial, 
		to assist with the registration process and/or gain feedback about the system. If you wish to unsubscribe from receiving 
		promotional emails during the free trial period, please use the unsubscribe link in the email itself or email us at 
		support@sharefile.com.
	</p>

	<p>
		Once a company creates an account with ShareFile, that company can optionally create accounts for employees and clients. 
		In order to create an account for employees, the email address of the employee as well as the first and last name of the 
		employee must be provided. You may optionally provide the employee's company name and/or time zone. We may add the email 
		address of employees to our company email newsletter. When adding clients to the system, companies must at minimum provide 
		an email address for the client, which is used as a login to securely access data on ShareFile. The client may also be 
		required to enter their first name and last name and can optionally provide their company name and time zone information. 
		We will never add the email addresses of client users to our email newsletter.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Emails from the ShareFile Support Team may be sent in the case of important notifications. These emails will be sent only 
		to registered employees (not clients). 
	</p>

	<p>
		If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters or promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by 
		emailing us at support@sharefile.com, or you may contact us at 1-800-441-3453 or at 510 Glenwood Avenue, Suite 221, 
		Raleigh, NC 27603 to opt-out.
	</p>

	<p>
		If your personally identifiable information changes, you may correct or update it by making the change in the "My 
		Settings" portion of our system or by contacting customer support at support@sharefile.com or 1-800-441-3453 or at 510 
		Glenwood Avenue, Suite 221, Raleigh, NC 27603. If you would like to have all of your files and personal information 
		completely removed from our system, please contact us using any of the above methods.	
	</p>

	<h2>Sharing and Usage</h2>
	<p>
		We will never share, sell, or rent your personal information with third parties for their promotional use. Occasionally, 
		we enter into contracts with third parties so that they can assist us in servicing you. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		For example, ShareFile uses a third-party (Cybersource) to process credit card transactions. This company is forbidden 
		from using your personal information for any other purpose than billing your account. Additionally, ShareFile uses 
		third-party software for web analytics to help understand the usage patterns on our web site. No personally identifiable 
		information is included in ShareFile's web analytics.		
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Our third-party contracts prohibit these vendors from using any of your personal information for their own purposes, and 
		they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them. We may disclose or report 
		personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law. 
		For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement 
		authorities, to comply with a legal process such as court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request. 
	</p>

	<h2>Use of Web Technologies</h2>
	<p>
		We use a variety of technologies on our sites. Among these are cookies; a piece of information that our websites provide 
		to your browser when you visit our sites. Cookies allow us to verify the login status of customers using products or 
		services linked directly with our website, track point of entry to point of registration for those users participating in 
		our affiliate signup programs, and to track and measure the success of a particular marketing campaign. Cookies also allow 
		us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer, enabling us to make your visit to our websites easier by 
		recognizing you when you return and helping to provide you with a customized experience. If you choose to disable cookies, 
		you may still use our site; however, you may have limited access to some areas within our websites. Session cookies are 
		cookies which are automatically deleted once you close your web browser. Session cookies are required in order to use the 
		ShareFile application. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We do not store any personally identifiable information in cookies (except for your email address if you elect for the 
		site to remember your login information), however, we may use unique identifiers in cookies to help us map your usage to 
		your User ID, which in turn ties to data in our internal databases which may include personally identifiable information. 
		We also keep track of activity on our website via log files stored on our web servers. We collect information such as IP 
		address, browser type and version, and pages you view. We also keep track of how you got to our site and any links you 
		click on to leave our site. Once you leave our site, we do not track you. We use your website activity to assist us in 
		offering you a personalized Web experience, assist you with technical support, diagnose problems with our server, 
		administer our websites and to tailor our product and service offerings to you.   
	</p>

	<p>
		If you use our web site and then subsequently sign up for ShareFile, we may associate your web site logs with personally 
		identifiable information about you such as your name and contact information. This information is kept on our internal 
		databases only and is not shared with third parties. It is used to help us better understand which parts of our web site 
		are most effective for users.		
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If you use the ShareFile application, we track your upload and download history as well as certain other pages you visit 
		in our system log. This log is used for support purposes to help troubleshoot problems that you may have with the system 
		and parts of the log may also be viewable by administrators, employees, and/or clients in your account for audit tracking 
		purposes.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Testimonials</h2>
	
	<p>
		We post testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as a customer's name and 
		company name. We obtain a customer's permission before posting testimonials to our web site, and customers may request 
		that their testimonial be removed from our web site by contacting support@sharefile.com or calling 1-800-441-3453. 
		Requests for removal from our web site will be fulfilled within 7 business days.		
	</p>

	<h2>Links</h2>
	<p>
		Some of our sites provide links to third-party websites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. 
		While on these sites, ShareFile or its partners may collect information about you. Because ShareFile does not control the 
		information policies or practices of these third parties, you should review their privacy policies to learn more about how 
		they collect and use personally identifiable information. 
	</p>

	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>
		We take every precaution to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by using 
		industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security procedures to protect 
		your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. When we ask for sensitive information, such as credit card 
		numbers, we protect it through the use of encryption during transmission, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
	</p>

	<p>
		ShareFile takes care to reinforce the importance of our website visitors' security and privacy among our employees. Our 
		employees are trained and required to safeguard your information and, using physical, electronic and procedural 
		safeguards, we restrict access to personal information to those employees and agents for business purposes only. 
		Additionally, we use internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security procedures. 
	</p>

	<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
	<p>
		If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, link to it from our home 
		page (www.sharefle.com), and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we 
		use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  
	</p>
	<p>
		We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material 
		changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
