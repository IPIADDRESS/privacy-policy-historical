<p> At ShapeFit, we respect your privacy and believe you should be informed 
about how we collect, use and disclose your Personal Information. This Privacy 
Policy describes our practices regarding how we use and share with third parties 
Personal Information (as defined below ) that we collect on the Website. By visiting 
the ShapeFit.com website and any other URLs and websites administered by ShapeFit, 
LLC and its affiliates (collectively, the “Website”) that are offered 
by ShapeFit, LLC and its affiliates (collectively, “ShapeFit” or “we” 
or “us”) or otherwise submitting your Personal Information to us, you 
accept the practices described in this statement. The terms "you" and 
"user" as used herein refer to all individuals and/or entities accessing 
the Website for any reason.</p>
<p><b>Terms of Use </b><br>
Your use of the Website 
is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the <a href="http://www.shapefit.com/terms-conditions.html">Term 
of Use</a> (“Terms of Use”), so please read this policy and the <a href="http://www.shapefit.com/terms-conditions.html">Terms 
of Use</a> before using the Website. All terms with initial capital letters used 
in this Privacy Policy but not defined herein have the meanings given them in 
the Terms of Use. Also review ShapeFit's <a href="http://www.shapefit.com/product-liability-waiver.html">Product Liability Waiver</a> which covers any products purchased on the ShapeFit.com website or through ShapeFit, LLC directly.</p>
<p><b>Age Requirement </b><br>In order to use the Website 
you must be at least 18 years of age or the legal age to form a binding contract 
in your jurisdiction if that age is greater than 18 years of age. Please see the 
<a href="http://www.shapefit.com/terms-conditions.html">Terms of Use</a> for additional 
information regarding this requirement. </p><p><b>Personal Information </b><br>The 
term “Personal Information” means information that identifies you as 
an individual, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, 
age, weight, and gender. We may ask you to submit Personal Information at various 
places on our Website, including by providing Registration Data, subscribing to 
a newsletter, or submitting feedback. ShapeFit also stores the information you 
enter about foods, activities, goals, and all other information collected in our 
online forms. </p><p>We maintain lists of users and use the Personal Information 
on those lists to contact you or send you information you have requested or that 
we feel will be of interest to you. We may contact you via phone, email, or postal 
mail. We generally provide an option for you to choose not to receive these types 
of communications. However, even if you request not to be contacted by us, we 
reserve the right to use your contact information if we consider it necessary 
to send you information about the operation of the site, including information 
regarding the services you have signed up for on the Website or information about 
changes to our Privacy Policy. For more information about how to “opt-out” 
of receiving emails or third party offers, please email us at info@shapefit.com 
for further details.</p><p>Posts submitted to the Community Pages are not confidential 
and may be viewed by other users and the general public. </p><p><b>Non-Personally 
Identifying Information </b><br>We may also collect information automatically 
about the use of the Website, through, for example, “cookies” or “IP 
addresses” (as described below). ShapeFit also archives log files and uses 
non-personally identifying information in aggregate form to detect errors with 
the Website, identify security issues, build higher quality, more useful online 
services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics 
and behavior of ShapeFit users, and measure demographics and interests in connection 
with specific areas of the Website. We may provide such statistical data to our 
advertisers, affiliates and other current and potential business partners. For 
example, we may inform these third parties as to the number of people who have 
seen and clicked on links to their websites. We also use such data to create a 
more enjoyable experience for our users, for example, to assist in selecting content 
and advertisers featured on specific channels, pages and site areas based on your 
general likes and dislikes. </p><p> “Cookies” are small files websites 
place on your hard drive that allow websites to identify you. For example, if 
you allow a website to remember your login name or password, the website places 
a cookie on your computer. Cookies cannot read any other information on your hard 
drive. We may place cookies on your computer to allow us to identify you when 
you visit the Website. We may use cookies to measure Website traffic, to offer 
you certain services, or to customize your visit. However, if you do not wish 
to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, your browser 
may permit you to do so. An “IP address” is a number that is automatically 
assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address 
stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer 
internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. 
</p><p><b>Use of Contractors and Service Providers </b><br>ShapeFit uses third 
parties (including contractors and service providers) to help with certain aspects 
of its operations, which may require disclosure of your Personal Information to 
them. For example, ShapeFit may use a third party to communicate with you (via 
telephone, email, or letter) about our services, to send information to you, to 
host the Website and related databases, and to perform other work that we may 
choose to outsource. ShapeFit requires these third parties to use your Personal 
Information only as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform. 
</p><p>The ads appearing on the Website are delivered to you by a third party. 
Information about your visits to the Website, such as the number of times you 
have viewed an ad, and your age, weight, gender, goals and region may be used 
to tailor the ads that are served to you. ShapeFit does not share your name or 
email address with advertisers, unless you specifically select to share information 
to receive an offer. In the course of serving advertisements to the Website, third
