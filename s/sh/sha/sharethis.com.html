				<p>Welcome to ShareThis, the next wave in sharing services and applications where you can stay in touch with your friends and share your web favorites with your friends. We take your privacy seriously; therefore, below we provide you with our privacy policy, where we intend to be transparent about any information we collect, how we intend to use it to your benefit, and what choices you have when you register with us and use ShareThis. Here are our commitments to you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Your privacy remains strictly under your control.</li> 
					<li>You can cancel your ShareThis account at any time.</li> 
					<li>We will never disclose your personally-identifiable information to any third party unless you expressly have given us permission to do so or we are required to do so by law.</li>  
					<li>You can decide whether you want to receive any offers from us that may be of interest to you.</li>
				</ul> 
				
				<p><strong>Information Practices</strong><br>
				When you register with us, interact with or use ShareThis applications and services, you provide information to us. In the following three sections, we explain what information is collected, how it is used to your benefit, and the choices that you have with your information.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Information Collected by ShareThis</strong><br>
				Registration with us is optional. However, please keep in mind that you may not be able to use some of our features such as our ShareThis button and address book functionality unless you register with us. Depending on how you interact with ShareThis, you provide us with information, which may include: (a) your name, email address, age (to comply with legal requirements), user name, password and other registration information; (b) your interaction with ShareThis features and advertisements; (c) transaction-related information, such as, when you make purchases, respond to any offers, or download software from us; and (d) information you provide us when you contact us for help. If we offer a personal interest and profile area on ShareThis, you may choose to submit additional information such as age, hobbies, and interests and other content, such as photos.</p>
				<p>We also collect other non-personally identifiable data, which may include your IP address and what browser you are using so that we can improve ShareThis' services to you.</p>
				<p>Resumes are requested for job applicants and are used to evaluate the candidate. Resumes are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with any entity unrelated to ShareThis.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Use of Information</strong><br>
				We will use your name so that we can personalize your experience. We will use your email address to contact you from time to time and we will use your email address for security reasons to confirm that you are who you say you are. You can control the types and frequencies of certain emails you receive, although you agree that we may always contact you to provide you with important information or required notices about ShareThis.</p>

				<p>If you decide to share your interests and your profile information with your friends on ShareThis, we will display your profile information according to the preferences you set in your account. We may determine categories of interests expressed by our users that we aggregate on a non-personally identifiable level. This aggregated "category of interest" information will enable us to improve our functionality, features, and offers of interest to our users. We will not disclose any personally-identifiable information such as, name, age, or email address to a third party, including advertisers.</p>

				<p>We may use your information (a) to deliver the ShareThis services and features desired by you (including any customization features requested by you), (b) to improve our services to you, (c) to personalize content and offers that may be of interest to you, (d) to respond to your inquiries, and (e) to fulfill your request for products or services.</p>

				<p>We may use the non-personally identifiable information, like your IP address, to analyze statistically site usage and to customize our site's content, layout and services. The resulting information will allow us to improve our services and better understand and serve our users.</p>
				
				<p>We do not sell customer lists. We will not share any information that identifies you personally with any third party unless it is necessary to fulfill a transaction you have requested, in other circumstances in which you have consented to the sharing of your information, or except as described in this Privacy Policy. We occasionally may share information with other companies that work on our behalf to help provide our services to you, provided that they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or to protect our rights and property or the rights and property of the public. We may also cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any official investigation and we may disclose your personally identifiable information to the relevant agency in doing so.</p>
				
				<p><strong>You Control Who Shares Your Information</strong><br>
				We may launch or offer from time to time user profiles services that let you save, either for yourself or to share with your friends, information about yourself, your favorite web sites and other interests. If you elect to use these features when they become available, the following information practices apply. Your profile information and contact information that you elect to store and use with ShareThis will only be given to friends you have specifically agreed to share such information. You will have the opportunity to decide what specific types of information about you, including your list of friends, contact information, interests or content that you want to share or do not want to share with others. You also can change these options at any time.</p>
				
				<p>We may offer one-click log-in features to our users. If we offer such features, you will have the option to decide whether you want to use the password management and one-click log-in features of ShareThis and you can add, disable or remove this information at any time in your discretion. This information will be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
			
				<p><strong>Be Careful if You Post Information Available to the Public</strong><br> 
				Whenever you voluntarily post personal information in public areas on ShareThis and on the Internet, like journals, blogs, message boards, and forums, you should be aware that this information can be accessed by the public. Please exercise discretion in deciding what information you disclose.</p>
