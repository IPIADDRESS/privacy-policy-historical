<h5 id="a1">Protecting the Privacy of Your Personal Information</h5>
<p>When you sign up with Shutterfly, you establish a password-protected personal account for storing, organizing and sharing your digital images, as well as for using our other services. In order to establish your Shutterfly account, we will need your name, email address and password.</p>
<p>The password will allow you access to your account; as such, it needs to be as secure as possible. A good password includes seemingly random letters and numbers, and isn’t obvious (such as names of a spouse, child, or pet).</p>
<p>You can update your account information and change your password at any time. You will find this at ‘Personal info/settings’ on your personal My Shutterfly page. If you have forgotten your password, you can set a new one by <a href="javascript:location.href=('/about/contact_details.jsp')">contacting our Customer Service team</a>.</p>
<p>When you order prints, products or other paid products or services, we will need the shipping address, billing name and address, as well as the credit card number and expiration date.</p>
<p>We may occasionally request information from users through surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. The information requested by us (or a third party survey vendor on our behalf) may include Personal Information, demographic information or attitudinal information.  Rest assured, the information collected is only used for purposes of improving user satisfaction with Shutterfly products and services, or in some cases, to notify winners and to deliver prizes. No Personal Information collected through these means is shared with or available to other third parties.</p>
<p>Testimonials are used to show benefits to certain programs Shutterfly offers. All testimonials in which Personal Information is included are always consented to prior to posting.</p>
<p>Any contact with our Customer Service team or communication from you, such as chat or emails, may be recorded to help us provide better service.</p>
<p>Shutterfly uses state-of-the-art protection, including Secure Socket Layers (SSLs), to encrypt pages when collecting sensitive information such as your password or credit card number. This measure is designed to guard against interception of this information while it is on the Internet. You can tell if you are using a secure page by looking at the bottom of your browser window where you will see a lock. If the lock is closed, the page is encrypted.</p>
<p>Shutterfly keeps the Personal Information you provide on servers that are protected against intrusion or unauthorized access by firewalls and other technological means. The servers are located in physically secure facilities, and only Shutterfly employees and agents are given access to the information on a need-to-know basis.</p>
<h5 id="a2">Protecting the Privacy of Your Pictures</h5>
<p>Shutterfly is designed so that you can control who may view the pictures and any associated information stored in your Shutterfly account. We are committed to keeping your pictures private and secure. We will never make your pictures publicly accessible, except by your explicit action, or as otherwise noted in this policy.  Please note that if you choose to post a link to your Shutterfly pictures on your own or others’ Web sites, or you share your pictures with your friends or family members and they post your share invitation on a Web site or forward to other individuals, these pictures may be accessible to others who view the email invitation or visit these Web sites.</p>
<p>In order to provide quality products, the Shutterfly employees and third-party service providers fulfilling your order or providing Customer Support to you may see your pictures.</p>
<p>Shutterfly holds pictures for at least 2 weeks after you delete them and then removes them from our server. If you accidentally delete your pictures or change your mind after deleting them, you’ll have from 2 weeks up to approximately 5 weeks to recover them by <a href="javascript:location.href=('/about/contact_details.jsp')">contacting our Customer Service team</a>. We’ll restore all of the pictures you’ve deleted, if they are available, and send you a confirmation email.</p>
<h5 id="a3">Protecting the Privacy of Your Friends &amp; Family</h5>
<p>Sharing your pictures electronically through Shutterfly’s share service is one of the key benefits we offer. If you want to share pictures with friends and family, you need to enter their email addresses. An invitation with a web link created specifically for your pictures will be sent to them. They may view, save, or purchase products from your pictures. We will not add their email addresses to a mailing list, or send them further email unless they sign up and choose to receive such communications from us per this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Your Shutterfly account contains an address book where you can store mailing and email addresses for your friends and family. You can use this information to quickly and easily share your pictures and send products from your account. Shutterfly will never use the information in your address book for any secondary purposes.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you use our Tell a Friend program to refer Shutterfly to your friends, we will use their email addresses to send your invitation and to credit your account with free product/s per the terms of the program. We will not add their email addresses to a mailing list, and we will not send them further email unless they sign up and choose to receive such communications from us per this privacy policy.</p>
<h5 id="a4">Protecting the Privacy of Children</h5>
<p>Our Web site is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Please do not register at Shutterfly if you are under the age of 13.</p>
<h5 id="a5">Keeping You Informed Through Email &amp; Mail</h5>
<p>As a Shutterfly member, we will notify you via email or through the mail about new features, products and promotions. We may also send you information on carefully screened third parties whose products or services may be of interest to you. You may unsubscribe to these notification services through your account profile on the Shutterfly Web site. Simply go to the My Shutterfly page and click on ‘Personal info/settings,’ then on ‘Email preferences’ or <a href="javascript:location.href=('/about/contact_details.jsp')">contact our Customer Service team.</a></p>
<p>From time to time, we may send you service announcement updates with important information about Shutterfly. Service announcements may contain information vital to your account, so members may not unsubscribe from service announcements.</p>
<h5 id="a6">Improving Your Site Experience with Technology such as Cookies</h5>
<p>Cookies are small data files stored by your web browser on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies enable you to use our site and services. Shutterfly never saves information, such as your password or your credit card number, on cookies. You may modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you may not be able to access the Shutterfly service.</p>
<p>We may also use other technologies such as clear gifs, pixel tags, and scanning navigational data to collect anonymous information about our users in order to help us deliver better service and user experience. Anonymous information could include the web site you were on before coming to Shutterfly, IP addresses, or areas of site being clicked on most frequently.</p>
<p>At times, we may combine information collected from our site and other information you shared with us to customize our service to you and improve your experience. For example, we may recommend products or offers you may be interested in based on what you have liked in the past, or remind you that you have an “active” shopping cart waiting for you.</p>
<p>Our third-party service providers may also use cookies or other technologies to help us manage our marketing efforts (these include ad servers, outbound email vendors, affiliate vendors and search engine advertising agencies, and providers of web analytics tools). Shutterfly has carefully selected these service providers and instructed these service providers not to collect Personal Information or share the anonymous information with anyone other than Shutterfly. You may find more information about opting out of most third-party service cookies at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a> or other related sites.</p>
<h5 id="a7">Providing Services through Third Parties</h5>
<p>Shutterfly shares Personal Information with carefully screened third-party service providers for the sole purpose of providing you with the products, services and information you have requested. Examples of such third-party service providers are credit card authorization companies, merchandise distributors and shippers. They do not store, retain or access your Personal Information except to provide our services to you.</p>
<p>In addition, but only upon your consent, Shutterfly may transfer Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes and to allow such third parties to provide you with the products, services and information that you have requested from them.  This could include, but is not limited to packages of discounts, rebates, and promotional offers, that are not Shutterfly products, services or information.  You can choose whether or not to provide your information to third party marketers by going to the My Shutterfly page and selecting the ‘Personal info/settings’ link and then clicking on ‘Email preferences.’  Such third parties from whom you have requested products, services and information will handle, store, retain and access Personal Information in accordance with the terms and conditions of their agreement(s) with you, as well as their own privacy policies.  It is your responsibility to carefully review such terms and conditions and privacy policies, and Shutterfly disclaims any and all liability relating thereto.</p>
<p>In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the Personal Information you submitted to us with information from third party sources.</p>
<p>For example, we use the US Postal Service's national change of address database in order to verify customer mailing addresses. We purchase marketing data from, for example, Yankelovich, Inc. and Donnelley and add it to our existing user database, to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think you would be interested. To enrich our Profiles of individual customers, we tie this information to the Personal Information they have provided to us.</p>
<p>Finally, Shutterfly may share very general information, which is not personally identifiable, about our customers as a group with business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we might say that a certain percentage of our customers live in California, while a different percentage live in New Jersey.</p>
<h5 id="a8">Partnering with Amazon.com</h5>
<p>Shutterfly is Amazon.com's exclusive photo services provider. When you register with us through Amazon.com, Amazon.com will receive most of your Personal Information. We will never provide credit card information to Amazon.com. Amazon.com will use such information in accordance with its own privacy policy located at <a href="http://www.amazon.com.">http://www.amazon.com</a></p>
<h5 id="a9">Your California Privacy Rights</h5>
<p>Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Shutterfly who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Shutterfly does not share Personal Information with any third parties except as disclosed above. To make such a request, please <a href="javascript:location.href=('/about/contact_details.jsp')">contact our Customer Service team</a>.</p>
<h5 id="a10">Abiding by the Law</h5>
<p>Shutterfly may be required by law to disclose Personal Information to law enforcement and regulartory authorities, even though you might have requested that we don’t share your information.</p>
<h5 id="a11">Changes and Notification</h5>
<p>We reserve the right to modify our privacy policy at any time. If our privacy policy changes, the revised policy will be posted on this site and we will change the ‘updated’ date on this page to reflect the date of the modification. Please check back periodically. You will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any material change in our privacy policy or of other changes to the policy at Shutterfly's discretion.</p>
<p>We will notify you via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days before transferring your Personal Information to a new entity as part of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of some or all of our assets if the new entity's treatment of your Personal Information will materially differ from the treatment described in this policy.</p>
<h5 id="a12">Contact us</h5>
<p>Shutterfly will do its utmost to keep all your information up to date when you provide it to us, and to guard your privacy by continuously evaluating the enforcement and nature of our policies.</p>
<ul>
<li>If any of your Personal Information changes, or you identify a mistake in our records, please use the account profile page on the Shutterfly website, or contact us and we will update your data right away.</li>
<li>Please <a href="javascript:location.href=('/about/contact_details.jsp')">contact us</a> to communicate any questions or concerns.</li>
