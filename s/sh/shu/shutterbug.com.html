</p><p>
In the case of preventing processing for marketing activities, you can opt out of marketing by signing in to your Safari account and updating your account settings.

</p><p>
<b>6.3 What we need from you to process your requests</b>
</p><p>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and to enable you to exercise the rights set out above.

Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
