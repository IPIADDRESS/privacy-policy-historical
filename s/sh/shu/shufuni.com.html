						<p>Shufuni, Inc.(“Shufuni”) recognizes that its 
						customers, visitors, users, and others who use 
						www.Shufuni.com or other web sites owned or operated by 
						Shufuni (the “Shufuni Sites”) (collectively or 
						individually “Users”) value their privacy. This Privacy 
						Notice details important information regarding the use 
						and disclosure of User information collected on the 
						Shufuni Sites. Shufuni provides this Privacy Notice to 
						help you make an informed decision about whether to use 
						or continue using the Shufuni Sites.<br>
						<br>
						This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject 
						to the Shufuni Terms of Use. Your use of the Shufuni 
						Sites and any personal information you provide on the 
						Shufuni Sites remains subject to the terms of this 
						Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use.<br>
						<br>
						Please note that any video, image, or other content 
						posted at the direction of Users onto the Shufuni Sites 
						becomes published content and is not considered 
						personally identifiable information subject to this 
						Privacy Notice.<br>
						<br>
						The Information Shufuni Collects<br>
						User Provided Information: You provide certain 
						personally identifiable information (such as your name 
						and email address) to Shufuni when choosing to 
						participate in various activities on the Shufuni Sites 
						such as uploading videos, posting messages in our forums 
						or in the video comments section, entering contests or 
						sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding 
						to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other 
						mailing lists.<br>
						<br>
						Cookies Information: When you visit the Shufuni Sites, 
						we may send one or more cookies – a small text file 
						containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your 
						computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Shufuni 
						uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A 
						persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. 
						Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on 
						subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be 
						removed by following your web browser help file 
						directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears 
						after you close your browser. You can reset your web 
						browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a 
						cookie is being sent. However, some features of the 
						Shufuni Sites may not function properly if the ability 
						to accept cookies is disabled. <br>
						Log File Information: When you use the Shufuni Sites, 
						our servers automatically record certain information 
						that your web browser sends whenever you visit any 
						website. These server logs may include information such 
						as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, 
						browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages 
						and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, 
						landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those 
						pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the 
						date and time of your request, and one or more cookies 
						that may uniquely identify your browser. <br>
						Clear Gifs Information: When you use the Shufuni Sites, 
						we may employ “clear gifs” (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which 
						are used to track the online usage patterns of our Users 
						anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable 
						manner). In addition, we may also use clear gifs in 
						HTML-based emails sent to our Users to track which 
						emails are opened by recipients <br>
						The Way Shufuni Retains Information<br>
						To preserve the integrity of website databases Shufuni’s 
						procedure is to retain information submitted by members 
						for an indefinite length of time. By submitting 
						information to Shufuni you are consenting to store that 
						information indefinitely. <br>
						If required by law, such as the Children’s Online 
						Privacy Protection Act (COPPA,) Shufuni will scramble 
						and/or encrypt that information to make it 
						unrecognizable. Shufuni will also respond to written 
						member requests to scramble account information. If you 
						wish to make such a request, which will require you to 
						verify your identity, contact the Shufuni Policy 
						Manager. ß needs to link to the contact info <br>
						The Way Shufuni Uses Information<br>
						If you submit personally identifiable information to us 
						through the Shufuni Sites, then we use your personal 
						information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the 
						features and functionality of the Shufuni Sites. <br>
						Any personal information or video content that you 
						voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in 
						messages and chat areas, within your public profile 
						page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be 
						collected and used by others. Your account name (not 
						your email address) is displayed to other Users when you 
						upload videos or send messages through the Shufuni Sites 
						and other Users can contact you through messages and 
						comments. Any videos that you submit to the Shufuni 
						Sites may be redistributed through the internet and 
						other media channels, and may be viewed by the general 
						public. <br>
						We do not use your email address or other personally 
						identifiable information to send commercial or marketing 
						messages without your consent or except as part of a 
						specific program or feature for which you will have the 
						ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your 
						email address without further consent for non-marketing 
						or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of 
						major Shufuni Site changes or for customer service 
						purposes). <br>
						We use both your personally identifiable information and 
						certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as 
						anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, 
						browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the 
						quality and design of the Shufuni Sites and to create 
						new features, promotions, functionality, and services by 
						storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and 
						trends. <br>
						We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: 
						(a) remember information so that you will not have to 
						re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit 
						the Shufuni Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized 
						content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness 
						of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate 
						metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, 
						etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and 
						status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. <br>
						When Shufuni Discloses Information<br>
						We provide personally identifiable information and 
						non-personally-identifiable information to our 
						subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses 
						or persons for the purpose of processing such 
						information on our behalf. We require that these parties 
						agree to process such information in compliance with our 
						privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit 
						their use of such information and to use other 
						appropriate confidentiality and security measures. <br>
						We do not share your personally identifiable information 
						(such as name or email address) with other, third-party 
						companies for their commercial or marketing use without 
						your consent or except as part of a specific program or 
						feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or 
						opt-out. <br>
						We do share non-personally-identifiable information 
						(such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit 
						pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) 
						with interested third-parties to assist them in 
						understanding the usage patterns for certain content, 
						services, advertisements, promotions, and/or 
						functionality on the Shufuni Sites. <br>
						We may release personally identifiable information 
						and/or non-personally-identifiable information if 
						required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief 
						that such action is necessary to comply with state and 
						federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to 
						a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. <br>
						Shufuni also reserves the right to disclose personally 
						identifiable information and/or 
						non-personally-identifiable information that Shufuni 
						believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to 
						enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against 
						liability, to investigate and defend itself against any 
						third-party claims or allegations, to assist government 
						enforcement agencies, to protect the security or 
						integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, 
						property, or personal safety of Shufuni, our Users or 
						others. <br>
						Your Choices<br>
						You may, of course, decline to submit personally 
						identifiable information through the Shufuni Sites, in 
						which case Shufuni may not be able to provide certain 
						services to you. You may update or correct your personal 
						profile information and email preferences at any time by 
						visiting your account profile page. Please note that 
						media files uploaded by Users to the Shufuni Sites 
						cannot be removed and remain subject to our Terms of 
						Use.<br>
						<br>
						To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable 
						steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify 
						your identity before granting you profile access or 
						making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining 
						the secrecy of your unique password and account 
						information at all times.<br>
						<br>
						Please contact Shufuni with any questions or comments 
						about this Privacy Notice, your personal information, 
						your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices by 
						emailing customer service.<br>
						<br>
						Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites<br>
						Shufuni allows other companies, called third-party ad 
						servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within 
						the Shufuni Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad 
						networks use technology to send, directly to your 
						browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the 
						Shufuni Sites. They automatically receive your IP 
						address when this happens. They may also use other 
						technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web 
						Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their 
						advertisements and to personalize the advertising 
						content.<br>
						<br>
						Shufuni does not provide any personally identifiable 
						information to these third-party ad servers or ad 
						networks without your consent or except as part of a 
						specific program or feature for which you will have the 
						ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that 
						if an advertiser asks Shufuni to show an advertisement 
						to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or 
						audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have 
						viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to 
						that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may 
						conclude that you fit the description of the audience 
						they are trying to reach.<br>
						<br>
						You should consult the respective privacy policies of 
						these third-party ad servers or ad networks. Shufuni’s 
						privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control 
						the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.<br>
						<br>
						Our Commitment To Data Security:<br>
						Shufuni uses commercially reasonable physical, 
						managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the 
						integrity and security of your personal information. We 
						cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any 
						information you transmit to Shufuni and you do so at 
						your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of 
						information, Shufuni makes commercially reasonable 
						efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, 
						please note that this is not a guarantee that such 
						information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or 
						destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, 
						or managerial safeguards.<br>
						<br>
						If Shufuni learns of a security systems breach, then we 
						may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can 
						take appropriate protective steps. Shufuni may post a 
						notice on the Shufuni Sites if a security breach occurs. 
						Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right 
						to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To 
						receive a free written notice of a security breach (or 
						to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic 
						notice) you should notify customer service.<br>
						<br>
						Our Commitment to Legal-Age Usage<br>
						Protecting children from adult ocntent is especially 
						important. For that reason, Shufuni does not knowingly 
						collect or maintain personally identifiable information 
						or non-personally-identifiable information on the 
						Shufuni Sites from persons under 18 years of age, and no 
						part of our website is directed to persons under 18, or 
						legal age according to state law. If you are under 18 
						years of age, then please do not use or access the 
						Shufuni Sites at any time or in any manner. If Shufuni 
						learns that personally identifiable information of 
						persons under 18 years of age has been collected on the 
						Shufuni Sites then Shufuni will take the appropriate 
						steps to delete this information.<br>
						<br>
						Special Note to International Users:<br>
						The Shufuni Sites are hosted in the United States and 
						are intended for and directed to Users in the United 
						States. If you are a User accessing the Shufuni Sites 
						from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with 
						laws or regulations governing personal data collection, 
						use, and disclosure, that differ from United States 
						laws, please be advised that through your continued use 
						of the Shufuni Sites, which are governed by U.S. law, 
						this Privacy Notice, and our Terms of Use, you are 
						transferring your personal information to the United 
						States and you consent to that transfer.<br>
						<br>
						In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy<br>
						In the event that Shufuni is acquired by or merged with 
						a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of 
						these circumstances, to transfer or assign the 
						information we have collected from our Users as part of 
						such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of 
						control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, 
						insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment 
						for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws 
						or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights 
						generally, we may not be able to control how your 
						personal information is treated, transferred, or used.<br>
						<br>
						Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice<br>
						This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and 
						users are encouraged to review the Notices periodically 
						to stay aware of any changes. In general, we only use 
						your personal information in the manner described in the 
						Privacy Notice in effect when we received the personal 
						information you provided. Your continued use of the 
						Shufuni Sites constitutes your agreement to this Privacy 
						Notice and any future revisions.<br>
						<br>
						For revisions to this Privacy Notice that may be 
						materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of 
						the personal information you have already provided to 
						us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before 
						implementing such revisions with respect to such 
						information.</p>
