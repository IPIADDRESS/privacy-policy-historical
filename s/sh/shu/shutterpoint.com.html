				<a name="MInfo"></a><h1>Membership Information</h1>
				In order to be a member of this website, you have to complete the 
				registration form. During registration users are asked to give 
				their personally identifiable information (such as name, age range, e-mail 
				address). We may use the e-mail address information to send 
				the reminders of upcoming storage space subscription expiration or
				running low on space reminders; notifications about 
				our new or existing products and services, special offers, 
				or to otherwise contact you regarding your account with us. 
				During registration you are asked to create a unique username that will be 
				required for gaining access to the member-only features of this 
				webiste. Your username is not treated as personally identifiable 
				information and may be shown on this website in connection with the 
				albums(s) you may choose to create and maintain. Additionally, your first and
				last name will be shown on this website in connection with the 
				albums(s) you may choose to create and maintain or in connection to
				the public member directory. Your e-mail address is never displayed
				anywhere at this website and it cannot be obtained by other users of
				this website. Additionally, your e-mail is never given, rented or sold
				to any third parties.
				<br><br>
				In the very rare cases, we also may use your first name, last name and 
				username in the promotional or marketing purposes. It is 
				optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as 
				age range, gender and similar information), but encouraged so we 
				can provide a more personalized experience on our site. &nbsp;We may share 
				the demographic information with third parties, such as researchers, 
				but only in the form of aggregated data. &nbsp;This helps us and our 
				partners understand our member demographics, and is essential and critical 
				to improving our services.
				<br><br>
				We do not share, sell or rent information about individual users with 
				any third party at any time, except:
				<ul> 
					<li>When you specifically authorize us to or request that we do so.</li> 
					<li>When we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the 
						law or legal process.</li>
				</ul>
				At any time after registration, members can change all information they 
				provided (with the exception of the username) by visiting the My 
				Information page under the My Account area of our website.
				<br>
				<a name="IP"></a><h1>IP Addresses, Cookies and Log Files</h1>
				Cookies are small files that our site places on the hard drive of your 
				computer to enable us to customize your experience and achieve some of the 
				site's functionality. While on our website, usage of a cookie is in no 
				way linked to any personally identifiable information. Cookies are the 
				very common mechanism used by major sites on the Internet. Visitors may 
				also receive cookies from third parties, including advertisers, but 
				ShutterPoint.com cannot have any control of the content of these 
				cookies. Please note that should you choose to refuse cookies on this 
				website, some of its functionality will be forfeited and some portions of the 
				site may become unusable. 
				<br><br>We use your IP address to analyze trends, administer the site and 
				help determine problems with the servers.  We may also automatically log IP 
				addresses to track a user's session, ratings, comments and 
				purchases. IP addresses themselves are not linked to personally 
				identifiable information, however they may be linked to a member's account records.
				<br>
				<a name="Surveys"></a><h1>Surveys</h1>
				We may occasionally conduct online surveys to better target our offering 
				to our audience. &nbsp;We may share any demographic data collected during 
				these surveys with our partners, but only in the form of 
				aggregated information. &nbsp;We will not share any information about 
				specific individuals gathered during a survey with third parties. Please 
				remember that your participation is optional and helps us improve our 
				services. 
				<br>
				<a name="Others"></a><h1>Your Privacy at Other Sites</h1>
				ShutterPoint.com contains many links to other sites in the form of text links or 
				banners. &nbsp;ShutterPoint.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or 
				the content of these sites. &nbsp;We recommend that you review the privacy 
				statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable 
				information.<br>
				This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this website. 
				<br>
				<a name="Opt"></a><h1>Opting Out</h1>
				You may request that we delete your membership and accompanying 
				member information at any time. You also may choose not to become 
				a member and not to participate in the "member-only" areas of our site, 
				this eliminates the need for you to give us any personal information at all.
				<br>
				<a name="Changes"></a><h1>Notification of Changes</h1>
				This policy can be updated on the as-needed basis and without prior 
				notice. &nbsp;If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those 
				changes on our website. &nbsp;If at any point we decide to use personally 
				identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the 
				time it was collected, we will notify our members by way of an 
				e-mail.
