<p>As set out above, we may collect information about your computer and website activity, including where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type, the internet address of the website from which you access our website and the date, time and duration of the access.<br>
  We save such log files for the purposes of determining disruptions and for security reasons (e.g., to investigate attack attempts) for a period of 7 to 10 days and delete them thereafter. Log files which need to remain stored for evidence purposes are excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been finally resolved and may be forwarded to investigating authorities on a case-by-case basis.<br>
  We also use such log files for website analytics and interest-based advertising by means of cookies (please also refer to the sections <a href="#6">"Cookies”</a>, <a href="#7">“Website Analytics”</a> and <a href="#8">“Advertising by means of tracking technologies”</a>. </p>

<h3>6. Cookies</h3>
<p>Shure uses cookies to improve performance and enhance the user experience for those who visit our website. Our <a href="https://www.shure.com/meta/cookies">Cookie Policy</a> does clarify how we do this and how cookies are managed.<br>
  Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page in order to provide shopping functionality, help analyse the website’s performance and to recommend content relevant to your visit. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your device the next time you visit.<br>
  We use cookies to record the existence of a browsing session and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our websites. Cookies can, however, be used to create a usage profile. In this case, you will be informed about this in this privacy policy (please also refer to the sections <a href="#5">"Log Files”</a>, <a href="#7">“Website Analytics”</a> and <a href="#8">“Advertising by means of tracking technologies”</a>).<br>
  If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or in most web browsers you can choose to turn off all or some cookies via your browser settings. Also, depending on what type of web browser and what browser version you are using, you may be able to change the properties on your cookie file so that cookies are not used or saved. Cookies can also be removed from your hard drive. Please check with your browser provider for more information on removing cookies.<br>
  Like most websites, if you decline to accept cookies, some of our services may not function properly (for example, you will not be able to log on to any part of the website which is accessible only to registered users). Where you are unable to log on to the website due to your declining cookies, you can still place orders by contacting customer service.<br>
  For further information on the use of cookies and how they are managed, please refer to our <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/meta/cookies" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>7. Website Analytics</h3>
<p>We require aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. For this purpose, we use the website analytics tools described in this section. The tools either do not collect IP addresses or anonymize these upon collection and any profiles created by these tools only contain aggregate data. The service providers providing these tools are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business and subject to our instructions.<br>
  You will find information below on each tool's provider and how you are able to object to the collection and processing of data by the respective tool. Please note that tools may use so-called opt out cookies in order to remember your objection. This opt out function relates to a device or browser and is thus valid for the terminal device or browser used at this time. In case you use several terminal devices or browsers you must opt out on every device and in every browser used. Note that in case you remove all cookies from your hard drive, your “opt out” might not work any longer.<br>
  Alternatively, you can avoid the creation of usage profiles by website analytics tools by generally deactivating cookies. For more information on how to do so, please refer to the section <a href="#6">"Cookies"</a> or to our <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/meta/cookies" target="_blank">"Cookie Policy"</a>.</p>

<p>The different providers of plugins are in the following summarized as “Plugin Providers”.<br>
  To increase the protection of your data when visiting our website, plugins are embedded using the so-called "Two Click Solution". This means that when a page of this website is accessed, a connection to the servers of the respective plugin provider is not yet established.<br>

<p><strong>California Residents’ Rights. </strong>California law grants California residents certain rights and imposes restrictions on particular business practices as set forth below.<br><br>
  <strong><em>Do-Not-Sell</em></strong>.&nbsp; We do not sell personal information about residents who we know are younger than 16 years old without opt-in consent. If you have further questions about our do not sell policy, please contact us as outlined in section 20 “Contacting Us”.<br><br>
  <strong><em>Initial Notice</em></strong>. We are required to notify California residents, at or before the point of collection of their personal information, the categories of personal information collected and the purposes for which such information is used.<br><br>
  <strong><em>Requests to Delete</em></strong><em>.<strong> </strong></em>Subject to certain exceptions, California residents have the right to, at no charge, request deletion of their personal information that we have collected about them and to have such personal information deleted, except where an exemption applies.&nbsp; <br><br>
  <strong><em>Request to Know</em></strong>. California residents have the right to request and, subject to certain exemptions, receive a copy of the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about them in the prior 12 months and to have this delivered, free of charge, either (a) by mail or (b) electronically in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily useable format that allows the individual to transmit this information to another entity without hindrance.&nbsp; California residents also have the right to request that we provide them certain information about how we have handled their personal information in the prior 12 months, including the: </p>
<ul>
  <li>categories of personal information collected;</li>
  <li>categories of sources of personal information;</li>
  <li>business and/or commercial purposes for collecting and selling their personal information;</li>
  <li>categories of third parties/with whom we have disclosed or shared their personal information;</li>
  <li>categories of personal information that we have disclosed or shared with a third party for a business purpose;</li>
  <li>categories of personal information collected; and</li>
  <li>categories of third parties to whom the residents’ personal information has been sold and the specific categories of personal information sold to each category of third party.</li>
</ul>
<p>California residents may make a Request to Know up to twice every 12 months.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Submitting Requests.</em></strong>Requests to Know, and Requests to Delete may be submitted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By emailing us at privacy@shure.com &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We will respond to verifiable requests received from California residents as required by law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>
  <strong><em>Right to Non-</em></strong><strong><em>Discrimination</em></strong><em>.</em>The CCPA prohibits discrimination against California residents for exercising their rights under the CCPA. Discrimination may exist where a business denies or provides a different level or quality of goods or services, or charges (or suggests that it will charge) different prices,&nbsp; rates, or penalties on residents who exercise their CCPA rights, unless doing so is reasonably related to the value provided to the business by the residents’ data.&nbsp; <br><br>
  <strong><em>Financial Incentives</em></strong>. A business may offer financial incentives for the collection, sale or deletion of California residents’ personal information, provided it is not unjust, unreasonable, coercive or usurious, and is made available in compliance with applicable transparency, informed consent, and opt-out requirements. California residents have the right to be notified of any financial incentives offers and their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at any time, and may not be included in such incentives without their prior informed opt-in consent; we do not offer any such incentives at this time.<br><br>
  <strong><em>You Rights Under California’s Shine-the-Light Law</em></strong><strong>. </strong>We do not share personal information collected online with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes and will not do so unless you agree to such disclosure. If you are a California resident and you still believe your information has been shared or you have general questions about how your information may have been shared, you may contact us by requesting a list of the third parties to which we have disclosed personally identifiable information about you for their own direct marketing purposes. You may make one request per year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response. You may request this information in writing by contacting us at via email at privacy@shure.com or at</p><br>
