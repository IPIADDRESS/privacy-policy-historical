	<div id="datenschutz"><h1>Privacy Policy</h1><p>Welcome to Shpock – the boot sale app for beautiful things!</p><p>The Finderly GmbH, Gredlerstraße 4/5-6a, 1020 Vienna, Austria (hereinafter referred to as "Operator") operates websites (shpock.com and other country specific top level domains like e.g. .co.uk, .de, .at) and mobile apps (Shpock app for Android, Shpock app for iOS) (hereinafter collectively "Shpock" / "Shpock services"), under the name "Shpock". The Operator is the controller of personal data. The Operator decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data and is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the processing takes place in accordance with governing personal data legislation.</p><h2>I. Preamble</h2><p>The Operator takes data privacy very seriously and wants to reveal openly and transparently how this topic is dealt with.</p><p>When Shpock is used, the Operator is provided with a set of personal data. Personal data means information which can directly or indirectly be linked to a living natural person. Examples of personal data include name, address, telephone number and email address; however, information about IP numbers and user behaviour when using the services may also constitute personal data. Below, the Operator explains to the users of Shpock (hereinafter referred to as “user” or “users”) how data, what kind of data and for what purpose data is collected and to whom this data may be shared with. Finally, the Operator informs users about their rights as well as internal rules for data storage.</p><p>This Privacy Policy is a supplement to the <a class="bold" href="http://shpock.com/en/terms/">terms and conditions</a> and applies to the use of the Shpock services and the utilisation of all other offered services on Shpock. The privacy policy applied refers to the policy available online at Shpock at the time of a user’s specific visit or at the time of the specific use of a Shpock service. By using Shpock services the user fully accepts this Privacy Policy. Otherwise the use of any Shpock-Service is not permitted.</p><p>The User may revoke his consent to this Privacy Statement at any time in writing (see Section VII).</p><p>This privacy policy is translated from the original German version. Please note that if this privacy policy is inconsistent with the privacy policy in German, the German version prevails.</p><h2>II. Data collection</h2><p>We collect data in connection with the registration of an account and also in connection with subsequent use of the Shpock services. In order to give a good overview of how the processing of personal data is carried out, the personal data has been divided into three categories based on how it is collected:</p><h3>1. Data that is given to us by the user</h3><p>When an account is created or activities are carried out through the framework of the account, personal information about the individual user is needed. Personal data in this category is characterised by the fact that the user actively provides the data to us by, e.g. completing a web form, reporting incidents to support, or providing us with feedback through functions created for such purposes.</p><p>To facilitate the registration for users and to reduce the threat of scammers and spammers the user has two ways of registering an account:</p><h4>a. Registration via Facebook Connect:</h4><p>The Operator accesses user data, , which is saved in the individual’s Facebook-Profile. The user agrees to share this data with the Operator during the registration process. This permission can be revoked at Facebook at any time. Of course, the Operator does not have access to the users’ Facebook-Login data. The Operator is not liable or responsible for wrong or unauthorized data transfers from Facebook. In order to preserve a certain amount of anonymity towards other users, only the profile picture of the user, the first name and the last name abbreviated to the first letter (John D.) instead of the full name (John Doe) is shown to other users.</p><h4>b. Registration with E-Mail and SMS-confirmation:</h4><p>The Operator hereby accesses the data of the user, which he has specified during the registration process, i.e. name, e-mail address and telephone number. The profile data given by the user must be correct, complete and must continuously be kept up-to-date. In order to preserve a certain amount of anonymity towards other users, only the profile picture of the user, the first name and the last name abbreviated to the first letter (John D.) instead of the full name (John Doe) is shown to other users.</p><h3>2. Data collected when you use the Shpock services</h3><p>By using the Shpock services and carrying out activities, the user provides data which is stored by the Operator in its database. This process takes place for user recognition and to ensure the delivery of the service that the user has requested. The Operator will also store information when the user contacts the Operator, for example when the user e-mails the Operator’s customer support, so that the Operator can assist the user and answer open questions. The Operator may also use anonymous and aggregated data about such inquiries to improve its services.</p><p>By using the Shpock services, the Operator gathers information about individual user’s activity, e.g. which services and screens are visited within Shpock and how they are used. The collected data can be divided into the following types:</p><h4>a. Technical information about the user’s device and internet connection</h4><p>Through server logs and other tools the Operator records information about the user’s device and internet connection, including operating system, browser version, IP addresses, cookies and other unique identifiers. The technical information is usually processed as aggregated data in order to analyse how the Operator’s services are used. The Operator may, however, link such data to the user’s account, for instance so that the Operator can customize the Shpock-services to the User’s device.</p><h4>b. Information about the use of the Shpock services</h4><p>The Operator registers the user’s account activities such as logging in or out of the user account, and any purchase of products or services through the Shpock services. The Operator also stores information about a user’s visit on Shpock. The Operator uses this information, amongst other things, to prevent abuse, to improve the Shpock services and to provide users with personalised services, recommendations and advertisements.</p><h4>c. Information about users’ location</h4><p>When Shpock is used, the individual user’s location may be estimated through the IP or Geo-location detected on the individual’s device. This information is, for instance, used to show content or provide offers relevant to the user’s location. This is done to improve the Shpock services and to identify and display the location of the classified ads listed by the user. In order to avoid the identification of a user’s actual exact location, a displaced location of the seller is shown in the published classified ads.</p><h4>d. Cookies and locally stored content</h4><p>When the user uses the Shpock services the Operator applies various technologies in order to recognize the user. The Shpock website uses “cookies” in order to enable all functionalities of the Shpock website and to facilitate the use of the page. For instance, the Operator uses cookies so that the user does not have to log in every time he visits the Operator’s services. The Operator may also store anonymous identifiers locally on the user’s device, especially mobile devices that are incapable of using cookies. See Clause VI below for more information on cookies and anonymous identifiers.</p><h4>e. Google Analytics</h4><p>The Operator uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. Google Analytics which also uses " cookies". The user is free to opt-out of data collection generated by cookies related to the use of the Shpock Website (incl. IP-address) as well as from the processing of such data. This can be done by simply downloading and installing the respective Browser-Plugin, do so by following this link (<a class="bold" href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>). Further information about Google Analytics and related data protection can be found under <a class="bold" href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> or under <a class="bold" href="http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html</a>.</p><h3>3. Information from other sources</h3><p>The Operator may from time to time receive information from other sources such as partners, ad networks and other third parties that help the Operator understand user activity and preferences. This is collected to improve the Shpock services. Examples of this include when the user creates a user account by connecting with his/her Facebook profile, and the Operator may add basic profile information. An advertising partner may also share information about what happened after the user had clicked on an ad on the Operator’s website, so that the Operator can measure the impact of an ad and provide more relevant content or advertisements. The analysis is usually carried out at an aggregated and anonymized level</p><h2>III. Processing purpose</h2><p>The Operator uses data of the user for the following purposes:</p><p>Summary of purposes: The Operator processes and may share personal data with other companies within the Schibsted Media Group for the purposes of (1) delivering the Shpock services; (2) improving and developing the Shpock services; (3) personalised advertisements, offerings and recommendations; (4) identification of market trends; (5) preventing, limiting and investigating abuse of the Shpock services.</p><p>More detailed information about purposes is available here below.</p><h3>1. Delivery of the Shpock-Services</h3><p>For the usage of Shpock-Services it is necessary, that the Operator identifies the users’ current location. This allows Shpock to show classified ads located close to the user and is also used when publishing classified ads by sellers. In order to avoid the identification of a user’s actual exact location, a displaced location of the seller is shown in the published classified ads.</p><p>In addition, the Operator uses other personal information to personalise a user’s account and offer a good user experience. This relates primarily to user experience in connection with registration, login, surfing between services and purchases of products and services.</p><h3>2. Improvement and further development of the Shpock Services</h3><p>The Operator uses information to improve its services, for instance by trying to make the registration, log in and payment processes for premium services as user-friendly as possible. This may result in, for instance, registering all steps (screen views, clicks) related to the search of a particular product in order to understand if certain elements of the process are confusing to the users or not. The analysis is usually carried out at an aggregated and anonymized level, but the Operator may also use identifiable data to provide technical support and to understand how each individual uses the Shpock services.</p><p>To improve the Shpock services and to detect and analyse errors, the Operator uses certain tracking-tools. Therefore, the Operator traces user behaviour independently as well as via third-party suppliers (e.g. Google Analytics, Fabric). Part of this data also contains (not solely) the users’ IP-Address and user behaviour. Please take note that Google and other third-party suppliers also save this data for statistical reasons and transfer this data to servers in other countries. Some third-party suppliers also reserve the right to share the collected information with other parties.</p><p>The Operator may inform the user about changes to or improvements of the Shpock services by using his e-mail address or through push notifications. In addition, the user will recurrently receive the Shpock newsletter. The newsletter can be unsubscribed in the user profile or by directly clicking on the unsubscribe link within the newsletter.</p><h3>3. Personalised advertisements, offerings and recommendations</h3><p>The Operator uses information to personalise and tailor services, and to also provide the users with a content that may be relevant to them. Sometimes the Operator serves content based on the user’s explicit wishes, such as if the user opts in to receive search alerts. The Operator may also serve content and recommendations based on user activities; for instance, when the Operator recommends products based on popularity among users. Furthermore, the Operator may use information in advertising campaigns that is tailored to the users when they visit affiliated services within the Schibsted Media Group.</p><p>The Operator can advertise via the Shpock services or the operator by collaborating with third party providers in order to optimise the impact of the advertisement.</p><h3>4. Identification of market trends</h3><p>The Operator analyses data to understand market trends in order to improve, develop and customise the Shpock services. Such analysis can be made both by the Operator directly or by so called data processors, which analyse the data on behalf of the Operator (subject to strict data processing agreements that maintain data confidentiality and integrity).</p><h3>5. Preventing, limiting and investigating abuse of the Shpock services</h3><p>We use information to restrict various forms of abuse of the Shpock services, such as fraudulent activities, denial of service attacks, spamming, unauthorized logins and other actions that violate our Terms &amp; Conditions, or are prohibited by law.</p><h2>IV. Usage of data by third parties</h2><p>For all services, that use social networking functionalities such as the Facebook-like button or the Google +1 button, please be aware, that Facebook and other suppliers of social networks can collect user data even if the user is not registered on the page or has not specifically approved the data transfer. By using popular functions such as the Facebook “Like-Button” or the Google “+1 Button” the providers of these features can draw conclusions concerning page visits and the individual user’s behaviour. Further information can be found in the terms and privacy policy of the respective supplier (amongst others <a class="bold" href="http://www.google.at/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">http://www.google.at/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>, <a class="bold" href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>).</p><p>Third parties that fall under the provisions of point V about the sharing of data may collect and use the data to improve their products and services and for analytics purposes. Third parties may disclose this data in an aggregated form only.</p><h2>V. Transfer of data</h2><p>The Operator will not share, sell, convey or otherwise disclose personal data other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, unless it is required to do so by law or the user has given his/her explicit consent to do so. However, personal data may be transferred due to the following reasons:</p><h3>1.Transfer of personal data within the Schibsted Media Group</h3><p>Personal data may be transferred to other companies within Schibsted Media Group and companies owned wholly or partially, directly or indirectly by Schibsted ASA insofar it is relevant for achieving the purposes for which the data has been compiled. Such companies may also independently process personal data with the aim of personalising and improving user’s experience, in accordance with the privacy policy applicable to each specific company.</p><h3>2. Disclosure of personal data to a third party</h3><p>If there is suspicion of illegal activities in connection with the use of our services, information may be disclosed to the police and other public authorities subject to a court or administrative order. The Operator may share information with other third parties if they can prove an overriding interest in the identity verification of a user as well as in the determination of certain unlawful facts. Further third parties have to substantiate that the knowledge of this information is essential evidence for a prosecution act. The matter stated above does not rule out that personal data assistants may be used. These process personal data on behalf of the Operator in accordance with written personal data assistance agreements and instructions. Personal data assistants who obtain access to user data (e.g. when a third party is used to perform payment transactions or store information on a server) are not granted any right to use individual users’ personal data for purposes other than those stated in this privacy policy.</p><h3>3. Transfer of personal data to a country outside the EU/EEA</h3><p>The Operator may transfer parts of users’ personal data to a third country, i.e. a country outside the EU/EEA. For example, personal data may be stored on servers located in a third country. We have established legal mechanisms to ensure that users rights are protected irrespective of such transfers.</p><h2>VI. Cookies and other technologies</h2><p>The Shpock website uses “cookies” in order to enable all functionalities of the Shpock website and to facilitate the use of the page. "Cookies" are small text files that allow the Operator to store specific information on the user’s PC while he/she visits the Operator’s website. Cookies support the Operator in finding out more about the frequency of usage of the website, the number of users of the website, as well as enabling the Operator to make offers as easily and efficiently as possible. The User may disable cookies in general, restrict them from certain websites or adjust his/her browser to notify him/her about cookies. Cookies can be removed from a PCs hard disk at any time. Please note that in this case the display of the website might be restricted and that the user guidance might be limited.</p><p>In addition to cookies, local storage, pixel tags and other similar technologies are used. These are used to achieve similar results to that of cookies. These technologies recognise users and the users’ behaviour. Sometimes these technologies are used in combination with cookies. These can only be blocked, removed or disabled in browsers that allow these settings.</p><h2>VII. Deletion of the user account</h2><p>The user is entitled to request the deletion of his/her account without giving any reason. The respective request must be written and should be sent to support@shpock.com. It should be noted that by deleting an account all personal data will also be deleted. The Operator reserves the right to maintain personal data regardless if the account has been deleted. Possible reasons for this include (but are not limited to) the enforcement of the terms and conditions, compliance with legislative requirements, support of investigations, enforcement of ongoing and unfinished deals as well as the settlement of disputes. If the storage of personal data is no longer necessary for the Operator, the data will be destroyed immediately.</p><p>The Operator notifies all third party recipients of personal data about the user’s request to delete his/her data, unless this proves to be impossible or is a disproportionate burden.</p><p>It should also be noted that the timely deletion of search results in search engines cannot be guaranteed by the Operator.</p><p>If the user wants to correct, rectify or erase data within the framework of the legal requirements, or if he decides to revoke his consent to this Privacy Statement he may send a written request to Finderly GmbH, Legal Department, Gredlerstraße 4/5-6a, 1020 Vienna, Austria. The written request should be justified if the user requests the deletion of his personal data within the legal framework. The Operator will, however, not be able to provide access to the Shpock services if the user revokes his/her consent.</p><p>It may take up to 8 weeks to process user requests as stated in this Clause.</p><h2>VIII. Duration of storage</h2><p>Personal data is kept no longer than necessary in order to be able to satisfy the purpose of the processing. Personal data is deleted or anonymized on a regular basis when it is no longer relevant for the purposes for which it has been collected. The Operator will, for example, retain personal data as long as the account has not been deleted or the user has revoked his consent according to Clause VI or as long as necessary for the provision of the Shpock services or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable laws.</p><h2>IX. Final provisions</h2><h3>1. Changes to the Privacy Statement</h3><p>As soon as the Operator changes the terms of this Privacy Statement, the amended version in combination with the respective publication date will be published herein. An explicit reference to the change of the privacy policy will not be made. The privacy policy shall automatically and periodically be reviewed by the users to comply with changes. If an individual user does not agree with the changes made, he/she is free to request the deletion their account or to revoke his/her consent of this privacy policy (also see Clause VII).</p><h3>2. Liability</h3><p>The Operator is not liable for unauthorized access of user data for example caused by hackers or system errors.</p><h3>3. Applicable Law</h3><p>This privacy policy shall be subject to Austrian law, excluding the UN Convention of International Sale of Goods and the reference norms (IPRG, EVÜ, etc.). The exclusive place of jurisdiction is the relevant court in Vienna, Austria.</p><h3>4. Severability Clause</h3><p>If individual stipulations of this privacy policy should be or become ineffective, invalid or unworkable, this shall not touch the legal effectiveness of the other stipulations of this privacy policy. In place of the ineffective, invalid or unworkable stipulation, a valid and workable regulation shall apply which approximates as closely as possible to that the contract partners would have economically intended if the contract partners would have pursued with the ineffective, invalid or unworkable stipulation. The above stipulations apply accordingly in the event that the contract is shown to be incomplete.</p><p class="italics">Privacy Policy Version: 2016-03-11 <br>Finderly GmbH, Vienna, Austria</p></div>			<img src="http://shpock.com/styles/Default/images/line_shpock01_480px.png" alt="shpock end line">
