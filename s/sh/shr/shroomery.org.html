<h1 align="Center">Shroomery Privacy Policy</h1>
 For obvious reasons, many visitors of the Shroomery are concerned with maintaining
their privacy and anonymity while browsing this page. The purpose of this
document is to provide a complete list of all cases where the Shroomery may
record or store information about you or your computer. Our intention is
to explain the reason for each of these instances, and provide you with instructions
for preventing such information from being recorded, if you wish.
<p> <b><font size="+1">IP Logging</font></b><br>
 The Shroomery server does log IP addresses when you visit a page.  This is done for our security and yours.  These logs are deleted from the server once a week.  IP logging could occur on a specific user's account in the rare case that they abuse policy or are threatening the stability of the site.  We reserve the right to log IPs at any time.</p>
<p> <b><font size="+1">Cookies</font></b><br>
Cookies are small pieces of data which the Shroomery stores on your hard
drive. The cookies we set can only be read by scripts on the Shroomery -
your web browser will not allow pages on any other domain to access the data.
Cookies have an expiration date, so that they don't stay on your hard drive
indefinitely. Your browser automatically deletes cookies which have expired.</p>
<p> You can prevent the Shroomery from setting cookies on your hard drive
by either connecting to the page through a proxy server, setting your web browser to reject cookies (or to prompt you before accepting
them), or by installing a third party cookie utility. </p>
<p> The cookies set by the Shroomery are outlined below. </p>
<ul>
 
  <li><b><u>Trip Report Rating</u></b><br>
 When you rate a trip report, the Shroomery stores a cookie on your hard
drive which contains the filename of the trip report and the rating you gave
it. This allows you to change your rating at a later date, and prevents people
from 'stuffing the ballot box' by rating a trip report multiple times. This
cookie expires 31 days after it is set.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><u>Trip Report Submission</u></b><br>
 When you submit a trip report, the Shroomery stores a cookie on your hard
drive which contains the filename of the trip report you submitted. This
prevents individuals from rating trip reports which they authored. This cookie
expires 1 year after it is set.
    <p> </p>
  </li>  
</ul>
 The Shroomery will not sell, give, share, or in any way transfer any information
we collect about our users for any reason whatsoever except as outlined below: 
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the event that the Shroomery is served with a legal subpoena, we
will provide the information requested. 
</li><p></p>
<li>We do and will take all measures possible to prevent anyone from getting any type of information about our visitors/members. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>We may provide information about the number of hits we receive and
the most popular pages on the Shroomery to potential advertisers, to help
them position their ads for greatest visibility. </li>
</ul>
 The Shroomery is very concerned with maintaining our users' privacy, and
we are constantly striving to create a secure and anonymous environment.
Please feel free to <a href="mailto:3dshroom@shroomery.org">e-mail 3D</a>
