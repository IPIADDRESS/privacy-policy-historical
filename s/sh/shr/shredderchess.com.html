<p>
The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (names, email addresses, etc.).
</p>
<p>
<b><span style="font-size: 10pt">Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</span></b>
</p>
<p>
Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.
</p>
<p>
<b><span style="font-size: 10pt">SSL or TLS encryption</span></b>
</p>
<p>
This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar.
</p>
<p>
If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.
</p>
<p>
<b><span style="font-size: 10pt">Information, blocking, deletion</span></b>
</p>
<p>
As permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time with information free of charge about any of your personal data that is stored as well as its origin, the recipient and the purpose for which it has been processed.

We hereby expressly prohibit the use of contact data published in the context of website legal notice requirements with regard to sending promotional and informational materials not expressly requested. The website operator reserves the right to take specific legal action if unsolicited advertising material, such as email spam, is received.
</p>
<p>
<b><span style="font-size: 12pt"><br>
3. Data collection on our website</span></b>
</p>
<p>
<b><span style="font-size: 10pt">Cookies</span></b>
</p>
<p>
Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.
</p>
<p>
Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.
</p>
<p>
You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case- by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.
</p>
<p>
Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
<b><span style="font-size: 10pt">Server log files</span></b>
</p>
<p>
The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in "server log files". These are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Browser type and browser version&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Operating system used</li>
	<li>Referrer URL</li>
	<li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
	<li>Time of the server request</li>
	<li>IP address</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>
These data will not be combined with data from other sources.
</p>
<p>
The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.
</p>
<p>
<b><span style="font-size: 12pt"><br>
4. Analytics and advertising</span></b>
</p>
<p>
<b><span style="font-size: 10pt">Google Analytics</span></b>
</p>
<p>
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
</p>
<p>
Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
</p>
<p>
Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.
</p>
<p>
<b>IP anonymization</b>
</p>
<p>
We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and Internet usage for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google.
</p>
<p>
<b>Browser plugin</b>
</p>
<p>
You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use of the website (incl. your IP address) from being passed to Google, and the processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link:<br>
<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_self">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Objecting to the collection of data</b>
</p>
<p>
You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt- out cookie will be set to prevent your data from being collected on future visits to this site: <br>
<a href="javascript:gaOptout()" target="_self">Disable Google Analytics</a> .
</p>
<p>
For more information about how Google Analytics handles user data, see Google's privacy policy:<br>
<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en" target="_self">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en</a> .
</p>
<p>
<b>Outsourced data processing</b>
</p>
<p>
We have entered into an agreement with Google for the outsourcing of our data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.
</p>
<p>
<b>Demographic data collection by Google Analytics</b>
</p>
<p>
This website uses Google Analytics' demographic features. This allows reports to be generated containing statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising from Google and third-party visitor data. This collected data cannot be attributed to any specific individual person. You can disable this feature at any time by adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the section "Refusal of data collection".
</p>
<p>
<b><span style="font-size: 10pt">Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</span></b>
</p>
<p>
This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google").
</p>
<p>
As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.
</p>
<p>
Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this by easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings. In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.
</p>
<p>
Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.
</p>
<p>
For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy:<br>
<a href="https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/" target="_self">https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/</a> .
</p>
<p>
You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case- by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.
