<h1>4INFO Privacy Policy</h1>

<h4 style="margin-bottom:1em;">Effective Date: August 25, 2009</h4>

4INFO is a mobile marketing and technology company. We focus primarily upon three areas of business: 1) we are the largest provider of free text message alerts and information in the United States; 2) we provide a technology platform that enables our clients to deliver, track and report on text message alerts that our clients sent out via our platform, and; 3) we offer an interactive media network to help our clients advertise via websites, WAP sites, SMS, and other forms of media.
<br><br>

At 4INFO, we take your privacy seriously. This policy is designed to inform you about our privacy practices on our corporate Website ("Website"), <a href="www.4info.com">www.4info.com</a>, including the SMS alerts that you may sign up for on our Website. This policy also addresses our technology platform and our media network. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@4info.com">support@4info.com</a>.

<h2 style="padding-bottom:0;">Policy for Information we Collect on this Website</h2>

<h3 class="i">Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
We collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") from the Website. PII is any information that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity. This includes, but is not limited to: name, address, telephone or cell phone number, or email address. We may collect PII under the following circumstances:
<ul>
	<li>When you choose to register with 4INFO on the Website, we will collect your email address and your cell phone number, and you will be required to provide a password as part of your registration. We may also ask for your wireless carrier, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, make and model of your mobile device, and your personal interests. You will also be offered the opportunity to receive 4INFO news via email and/or SMS. 4INFO may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from our business partners.</li>
	<li>When you sign up to receive one of our SMS alert messages on the Website, or with our partners, we may ask you to register with us. (See above) If you register for an SMS alert via one of our partner websites, they will make it clear that you are registering with 4INFO, and provide you with a link to this privacy policy. Please note that you may also sign up to receive our SMS alerts without registering, by providing us with your cellular number via the Website.</li>
	<li>When you use 4INFO products and services, even if you do not register, 4INFO collects and stores information about your transactions with us. 4INFO automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your product or service usage including your cell phone number or IP address and all messages sent to 4INFO short codes.</li>
	<li>If you enter one of our partner's sweepstakes, we may ask for PII so that we may contact you in the event that you win the sweepstakes.</li>
	<li>When you choose to send us PII about yourself in an email or by completing an online form on this Website, we use this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry or to fulfill your request to receive one of our business case studies or white papers. Once collected, we will store your PII for a reasonable time for record keeping purposes. The information that we store is usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="i">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII") from visitors to this Website. Non-PII is information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to this Website, the referring URL and your computer's operating system. When you register with us, we may ask you to provide your wireless carrier, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, the make and model of your mobile device, and to select your personal interests. This information will be combined with your mobile phone number in order to serve targeting advertising to you.

<h3 class="i">Cookies</h3>
We use "cookies" on this Website in order to us to retain your login preferences if you sign up to receive our SMS alerts. Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Please note that removing or otherwise disabling cookies may reduce your ability to enjoy the full functionality of the Website. For more information about cookies please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/</a>. 

<h3 class="i">Third Party Advertisers</h3>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may collect information about your visits to our Website, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information).  These companies may also use that information to serve ads about goods and services that may be of interest to you on this Website, and other websites. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.

<h2>Ways Information collected via the Website is used</h2>
4INFO uses information for the following general purposes:
<ul>
	<li>To help us deliver and customize the SMS messages that we send, we may use the information that you provide to us, and may merge that information with additional information we obtain from our partners. For example, we may use your cell number to run a lookup through your wireless carrier to determine the type of phone you have in order to provide you with more relevant advertising.</li>
	<li>We may use any of the information under our control in order to improve, or to better understand how our products or services are used. </li>
	<li>We may use your PII to contact you in order to answer a question or address a concern that you've raised, or to provide customer service on your account.</li>
	<li>We may use your PII to conduct research by sending you a survey. We don't combine the survey results with other information under our control.</li>
	<li>We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your 4INFO account, such as service announcements and administrative messages.</li>
	<li>We welcome your comments and suggestions regarding the web site. However, any comments, feedback, notes, messages, ideas, suggestions or other communications (collectively, "Comments") sent by you to 4INFO shall be and remain the exclusive property of 4INFO. We won't release your name in a way that contradicts this Privacy Policy, but we may share your Comments without identifying who you are.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information we Collect via our Technology and Network</h2>
This section of the  policy is designed to help you understand how our technology platform ("Technology") and our media network ("Network") processes information on behalf of the advertisers, WAP and website owners and other businesses that use our services (our "Clients").

<h2>Overview of our Technology</h2>
Our Technology is designed to help our Clients deliver advertising and content to your mobile device and your computer. For example, Clients use our Technology to perform the following:
<ul>
	<li>Send SMS messages and alerts to your mobile device,</li>
	<li>Place ads into those SMS messages and alerts,</li>
	<li>Place ads into mobile games, applications and WAP sites,</li>
	<li>Place ads onto websites that you visit while on the Internet,</li>
	<li>Understand which ads are placed, and which are clicked on by you and others.</li>
</ul>
Please note that not every client uses our Technology the same way. For example, one client may only use the Technology to deploy SMS messages, while another Client may deploy SMS messages on their own, but will use our Technology to serve ads and report on how many clicks each ad receives.

<h3>Overview of our Network</h3>
Our Network facilitates the serving of advertisements on to interactive media, including websites, WAP sites, online and mobile games and SMS messages ("Interactive Media"). Our Network collects information about your use of Interactive Media (e.g., the websites visit and the advertisements that you see while surfing the Internet.) You may encounter our Network when 4INFO or one of our Business Partners purchases advertisements on Interactive Media. We use the information collected by our Network in order to help facilitate the advertisements that you see, to make the ads you see more relevant to you, and to help our Clients understand whether the advertisements they've purchased are effective. 

<h3 class="u">Information collected by our Technology and Network</h3>
The information we gather about you can vary according to the method through which the information is gathered. When you opt-in to receive an SMS message from one of our clients, we gather information associated with your mobile device. The information we gather, regardless of the channel through which it is gathered, may include your name, address, email, phone number, demographic data, connection data associated with your mobile device or computer, and/or the wireless carrier to which you subscribe.
<br><br>

Our Technology does collect and use Non-PII, including: the IP address used to access the mobile Internet, the type of phone or other mobile device used, the date and time one of the mobile ads we facilitate was delivered and, if applicable, clicked.

<h3 class="u">Ways Information collected via our Technology and Network is used.</h3>
4INFO uses this information to analyze trends and to help our Technology tailor advertisement placement on behalf of our Clients. We also may aggregate this information and share it with our affiliates, advertisers, employees, customers and Business Partners.

<h2>Policies for the Website, the Technology and the Network</h2>
<h3 class="b" style="margin-top:0;">Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
4INFO does not rent, sell, or share PII about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, except when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

<h3 class="i">Agents</h3>
We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to enable them to perform those tasks. Examples include sending email, sending text messages, analyzing data, and providing user services. Each of our agents are contractually required to handle information in a way that is consistent with this privacy policy.

<h3 class="i">Adherence to Law</h3>
We may release information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of 4INFO, our employees, our users, or others. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.

<h3 class="i">Business Transfers</h3>
Moreover, if 4INFO, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that 4INFO goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, the information we have would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of 4INFO may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy.

<h3 class="i">Client Lists</h3>
We facilitate the delivery of text messages on behalf of some of our Clients. Any of our Clients may choose to use a different service provider to facilitate that delivery. In such cases, if you are on our Client's list, we may transfer your information back to our Client so they may deliver messages to you via another technology provider.

<h3>Your Access to Your Information</h3>
4INFO allows you to access your information for the purpose of viewing, and in certain situations, updating that information. You may view and edit the information you've provided us when you registered with us, including your name, your phone number, your email address, and the alerts to which you have subscribed. In order to access your information, you must provide us with your user name and password so we may authenticate who you are. 
<br><br>

When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our archives.

<h3>Security</h3>
The security of your information is important to us, including but not limited to the PII collected via the Website. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 
<br><br>
