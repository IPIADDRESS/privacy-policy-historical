                    at Shriram General Insurance. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or
                    sell product lines jointly with these businesses. <a href="#examples">Click here</a> for some examples of co-branded and joint offerings. You can tell when
                    a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer
                    information related to those transactions with that third party. </span></li>
                  <li><span class="small"><b>Third-Party Service Providers:</b> We employ other
                    companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
                    include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and
                    e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing
                    data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and
                    links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card
                    payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal
                    information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for
                    other purposes. </span></li>
                  <li><span class="small"><b>Promotional Offers:</b> Sometimes we send offers to
                    selected groups of Shriram General Insurance customers on behalf of other businesses.
                    When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If
                    you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. </span></li>
                  <li><span class="small"><b>Business Transfers:</b> As we continue to develop our
                    business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units.
                    In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the
                    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in
                    any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
                    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Shriram General Insurance, Inc.,
                    or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information
                    will of course be one of the transferred assets. </span></li>
                  <li><span class="small"><b>Protection of Shriram General Insurance and Others:</b> We release
                    account and other personal information when we believe release is
                    appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of
                    Shriram General Insurance, our users, or others. This includes
                    exchanging information
                    with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit
                    risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling,
                    renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable
                    information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the
                    commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. </span></li>
                  <li><span class="small"><b>With Your Consent:</b> Other than as set out above, you
                    will receive notice when information about you might go to third

                These third-party Web sites and advertisers, or Internet advertising
                companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or
                "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Web site directly to
                your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this
                happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known
                as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure
                the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.
                We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that
                they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and
                third-party Web sites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please
                contact them directly for more information about their privacy
                practices. In addition, the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a> offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also

                about how to opt-out of their information collection. <br>
                <br>
                Shriram General Insurance also displays personalized third-party advertising based on
                personal information about customers, such as purchases on Shriram General Insurance,
                visits to Shriram General Insurance Associate Web sites, or use of payment services like
                Checkout by Shriram General Insurance on other Web sites. <a href="#examples">Click here</a> for more information about the personal information that we gather.
                Although Shriram General Insurance does not provide any personal information to
                advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume
                that users who interact with or click on a personalized advertisement
                meet their criteria to personalize the ad (for example, users in the
