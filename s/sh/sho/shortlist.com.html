                 <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p class="Wighead1">What Information We Collect</p>

<p>You will be required to register with us to use certain features
on the website and/or to receive the email service (together
referred to as the Services). When you register, we will collect
personal information about you (such as your name, age, gender,
email address, and home and work postcodes). This data allows us to
provide a personalised service to you. By registering, you agree to
us accessing and collecting such personal information about you. We
will create an account for your use of the Services based on the
information you give (an Account). We may also ask that you provide
other information to us for your Account. You are under no
obligation to provide any such information. However, if you choose
to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide
you with the Services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please remember that you are responsible for keeping your
Services password confidential, and you are responsible for all
activities that occur on your Account whether or not authorised by
you.&nbsp; Please notify us immediately of any unauthorised use of
your password or Account or any other breach of security. We cannot
be liable for any loss or damage which results from the disclosure
of your password contrary to these Terms.</p>

<p class="Wighead1">How We Store and Process Your Information</p>

<p>For technical, analytic and processing reasons only, information
we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed by our
service providers or other reputable third party organisations,
some of which may be situated outside the European Economic Area
"EEA". In addition, if you use our Services while you are outside
the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EEA in
order to provide you with those Services. None of these third
parties will have any right to use the information other than to
provide technical, analytic or data processing services for us in
accordance with this Privacy Policy. By using the Services, you
agree to the collection, transfer, storage or processing of
information about you for these purposes.</p>

<p class="Wighead1">How Your Information Is Used</p>

<p>We will use the information you provide to us in one or more of
the following ways only:</p>

<ul>
<li>to monitor, develop and improve the Services and your use of
the Services;</li>

<li>to assist in and administer the provision of Services to you
(i.e. to despatch emails to you, or to provide you with password
reminders, or notify you that a particular service has been
suspended for maintenance);</li>

<li>to process and deal with any complaints or enquiries made about
or by you;</li>

<li>to contact you about a submission you have made to the
Services; and/or</li>

<li>to understand customer trends and patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p class="Wighead1">When We May Contact You</p>

<p>We may contact you:</p>

<ul>
<li>in relation to the functioning of any service you have signed
up for in order to ensure that we can deliver the service to
you;</li>

<li>where you have opted to receive regular emails from us;</li>

<li>in relation to any contribution you have made to the
Services;</li>

<li>to inform you of the results of a competition you have
entered;</li>

<li>to invite you to participate in surveys about the Services
(participation is always voluntary); and/or</li>

<li>for marketing purposes where you have specifically agreed to
that contact.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will only ever contact you by email, using the email address
that you provide to us.</p>

<p class="Wighead1">Will I Be Contacted For Marketing Purposes?</p>

<p>If you have opted to receive one of our regular emails we will
from time to time:</p>

<ul>
<li>send you information by email about existing and new services,
products and special offers from us; and/or</li>

<li>send you information by email about related products or
services of selected third parties that may be of interest to
you.</li>
</ul>

<p>These emails will only ever come from us, even when they refer
to third party products or services. You will be able to opt out of
receiving these emails but if you opt out we will have to stop
sending you any sort of email.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Wighead1">Will We Share Your Personal Information With
Anyone Else?</p>

<p>We guarantee that the personal information that we collect from
you will never be shared with another organisation for marketing
purposes unless you specifically agree to allow it. The permission
will be made clear through a tick box on a competition or offer.
The sponsor will be clearly named in the text next to the tick box
and if the box is not ticked no data will be shared. If you do
choose to tick the box the data will only be shared with the
sponsor and will only be used by that sponsor for their own
marketing purposes. The only case in which another organisation
will have access to your information is to analyse or process it as
described under the heading "How We Store and Process Your
Information" above. No organisation will be allowed to use your
information for its own purposes without your permission.</p>

<p>Keeping Our Records Accurate</p>

<p>We aim to keep our information about you as accurate as
possible, but we depend on you to update your personal information
whenever necessary.&nbsp; You can review, change or delete the
details you have supplied to us at any time by logging into your
account directly or clicking on the change details link on the
bottom of every email .If you have any other query relating to your
information, please contact us as set out below.</p>

<p class="Wighead1">Your rights</p>

<p class="indented">You have the right to request a copy of the
personal information we hold about you and to have any inaccuracies
corrected.&nbsp; We charge £10 for information requests and we will
ask you to prove your identity with two 2 pieces of approved
photographic identification. We will use reasonable efforts to
supply, correct or delete personal information about you on our
files. Please address requests and questions about this or any
other question about this Privacy Policy to The Information
Protection Officer, ShortList Media Ltd, 26-34 Emerald Street,
London, WC1N 3QA.</p>

<p class="Wighead1">Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>

<p>We reserve the right from time to time to change or update this
Privacy Policy. &nbsp;All changes will be published on the
Services. Each change will become effective on publication and you
will be deemed to be aware of and bound by it. You should therefore
review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are
up-to-date with the current terms of the Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>IP Addresses, Cookies and Web Beacons</p>

<p>We may collect information about your computer, including where
available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for
system administration and to report aggregate information to our
advertisers. This information is limited to statistical data about
our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any
individual.</p>

<p>For the same reason, we may obtain information about your
general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on
the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that
helps us to improve the Services and to deliver a better and more
personalised service. They enable us to:</p>

<ul>
<li>identify who you are and to access your account
information;</li>

<li>estimate our audience size and patterns;</li>

<li>control how often visitors see similar ads; and</li>

<li>track preferences and to improve and update the Services.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on
your Internet browser which allows you to refuse the setting of
cookies. You can also delete cookies that have been installed on
your hard drive - consult your software manual for further
help.&nbsp; However, if you select the refuse setting, or delete
cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Services.
Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will
refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to
our site.</p>

<p>Security</p>

<p>We have installed security measures to ensure that any personal
data entered on the Services is protected against loss, misuse or
alteration. However, due to the nature of the Internet, we cannot
guarantee the protection of your personal information and we cannot
be responsible for any outcomes resulting from a breach of security
when the Services are used.</p>
