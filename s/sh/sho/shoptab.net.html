		Watershed Software, LLC ("ShopTab") is serious about protecting your privacy and recognizes that you care how information about you is used and shared. We appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice (this "Privacy Policy") describes how we may collect personal information about you, how we may use it, what choices you have regarding it, and how we protect it. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is a part of the Terms of Use of this ShopTab Web site (Facebook App or the "Site") and we encourage you to become familiar with the terms and conditions contained herein. By accessing and using this Site and the ShopTab Service, you agree that you have read and agree to this Privacy Policy, and that you accept and consent to the privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

			  ShopTab may collect various types of information from or about you. During the Site registration process, you supply us with basic contact information (such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and company name) that we use for billing and contact purposes.

Should you purchase any ShopTab Services on or through the Site, the information that you supplied during the registration process may be used to track details about that purchase. We may also collect information regarding the origination source of visitors, their site activities and purchase behavior for our internal use only.   We do not collect any information from your customers. ShopTab does not have access nor any ability to use any of the personally identifiable data that may be collected by the third-party e-commerce application to which ShopTab links.

ShopTab is not responsible for any data collected by Organizations using other third-party technology to complete the ordering process.<br><br>
			  <strong>How Do We Use The Information That We Collect?</strong><br><br>ShopTab uses the information that it collects for the following purposes:  to fulfill your requests for services, to contact you, for billing purposes, to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, for violations of ShopTab's terms of use or as otherwise required by law, to improve the services that ShopTab makes available on the Site, to notify you of changes made to the Site or new products and services made available on or through the Site, to evaluate your needs and customize Site content delivered to you according to those needs, to facilitate the processing of any purchases you make through the Site, to send you promotional material from ShopTab and some of our affiliates, and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes of ShopTab]. ShopTab does not share information collected about you with third parties. It is our policy not to sell lists containing personal information about Site users, registrants or subscribers. <br><br>
