  <p>

This Privacy Policy governs our websites, mobile applications, and related services, including ShopItToMe.com and any other websites and services we own or operate whether accessed directly, via mobile software, or through a third party application or service ("Service(s)"). This Policy describes our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information on our Services. Other than as set forth herein, we will not provide your personally identifiable information to third parties without your specific permission.
  </p>

  <p>
    By visiting or using any of our Services, including e-mail alerts, you consent and agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use and that you may be transferring your data to, and consent to having your data transferred to, and processed in, the United States. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout this Privacy Policy we may refer to Shop It To Me as "us" or "we," and we may refer to you as the "user" or "end user."
  </p>

  <p><b>1. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</b></p>

  <p>
    The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve our Services and your experience with Shop It To Me, such as by customizing content (including advertising content), responding to e-mail requests, and communicating with you. We gather the following types of information:
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>A. Information You Provide to Us:</b> We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any way. This may include your name, nickname, email address, mailing address, password, telephone number, date of birth, photos, gender, shopping, price and brand or size preferences, purchase and return data, and any other information you provide in your profile or registration or otherwise provide to us, such as when ordering a product (which may include your credit card and related information), entering a contest or sweepstake, filling out a survey, writing or commenting on the site or app, providing feedback, requesting information, applying for a job or submitting an affiliate agreement or sending messages or performing searches.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B.  Logging in Via a Third Party Site:</b> We collect information when you register to join our Services by logging in via an account that you already have with a third party social network site ("SNS") such as Facebook or Twitter.   For example, our Service may allow you to create an account and login to the Service using your Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect. If you create your account using your SNS credentials, you are using the personal information you provided to the SNS (such as your name, email address, and other information you make available via the SNS) to create your user account on our Service, and, with your permission, may enable us to access additional information to enable us to enhance and personalize our Service to you; the information we receive and collect may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS, so please consult the SNS's privacy and data practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to participate in or utilize the activity or Service, such as receive email alerts, post comments to our websites, create a user profile, perform searches or queries, send messages, purchase products or services, or communicate with us.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C. Uses of User Provided Information.</b> We use this information to provide our Services to you, enhance the operation of our Websites, improve our Services, marketing and promotional efforts, analyze use of our website(s) and mobile application(s), administer sweepstakes and contests, and to promote our Services to, and tailor your experience with, third parties as provided in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy. Our mobile applications, browser extensions, and websites may send you notifications, such as alerts, sounds, and icon badges. Push notifications or in-app messages may include both operational messages and promotional messages regarding products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you. When using mobile applications, push notifications and other mobile alerts can be configured in the settings of your mobile device. As with emails, even if you opt out of receiving promotional communications, we may continue to send you non-promotional push notifications, such as those about your use of the applications or our ongoing business relations.  We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, track complaints about merchants and retailers, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. For example, if you comment or otherwise choose to display a preference of or on any of our Services, or send our customer service an email, we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our Services, and/or post or display your comment or preference in our marketing materials or on our Website. Your comments may contain personal information such as your name and if provided, your profile picture, and if so, if you have not already consented to posting it for public view (e.g. if the sharing is not readily apparent in utilizing the activity or via your profile settings), we will obtain your consent prior to posting it for public view. In addition, if you use our Service to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal information.

    Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies (the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies).
