If you do not agree with any portion of this Policy, you are prohibited from using or accessing ShortStack.</p> <h3 id="general">General</h3> <p>When you open an account with ShortStack and use the ShortStack application, you will provide certain information to Pancake and, during your use of ShortStack, Pancake will learn, collect and use certain additional information about you for various purposes, as more fully set forth in this Policy.

Such information includes, without limitation, your internet protocol address, browser types, domain name, and other statistical data involving your use of ShortStack and/or our services. Such information is collected passively using various technologies or may be provided by you through communications with ShortStack or Pancake.</p> <p><em>Pancake uses “cookies.”</em> A cookie is a piece of information that ShortStack gives to your computer when you access ShortStack. Cookies are used by Pancake to track your usage of ShortStack, trends on the usage of ShortStack and to improve ShortStack and analyze and assess changes to, successes and failures of ShortStack and portions thereof.</p> <p>For security purposes and to ensure the availability of ShortStack, Pancake also uses software programs to monitor network traffic, to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage to ShortStack or Pancake.</p> <p>Based on how the internet operates, when you visit ShortStack we automatically receive the uniform resource locator of the prior webpage that you were on and of the webpage where you go after ShortStack.

Testimonials and other marketing, promotions and advertisements may include obfuscated Personal Information (such as first name and general location) that you have provided to Pancake.</p> <p>Pancake may also disclose your Personal Information to a third party as part of a sale of the assets of Pancake, as the result of a change in control of the company, or in connection with an investment in Pancake by a third party. Any third party to which Pancake transfers or sells Pancake’s assets will have the right to continue to use your Personal Information.</p> <p><em>Access to and Protection of Your Personal Information.</em> You have a right to access, modify, correct and request that Pancake internally delete any Personal Information provided to or obtained by ShortStack or Pancake. If you update, modify or correct any Personal Information, we may keep copies of your Personal Information prior to such update, modification or correction for uses provided for in this Policy. You may request internal deletion of your Personal Information at any time by contacting Pancake in the manner provided on ShortStack. Pancake will endeavor to respond to your request in a timely manner. Please note, however that Personal Information you have published on Facebook may remain available even if you request that such information be internally deleted by Pancake.</p> <p>Any Personal Information that you provide to Pancake will be protected in a commercially reasonable manner.</p> <h3 id="user-collected-information">User Collected Information</h3> <p>Among other functions of ShortStack, you may create a webpage that collects certain information from customers and other persons that visit your webpage. Should you create any webpage that collects personal information or other information related to any person or party visiting that page (“User Collected Information”), you represent and warrant to Pancake that any and all User Collected Information has been collected in accordance with any applicable laws, rules or regulation and not in violation of any privacy or similar rights of such persons or parties. As a part of ShortStack, Pancake may store such User Collected Information, but asserts, and you hereby agree and acknowledge, that Pancake has no right, title or interest in or to such information, has not participated or been involved in any such collection, and has no responsibility or obligation with respect to the legal compliance of your collection practices with respect to such information. Pancake may disclose any User Collected Information in the same manner, and under the same circumstances, as any Personal Information may be disclosed. You hereby indemnify and hold harmless Pancake, and all of its officers, directors, shareholders, employees and agents, with respect to any claim, suit or liability (including attorney’s fees and related costs), arising from your User Collected Information.</p> <h3 id="safe-harbor-privacy-provisions">Safe Harbor Privacy Provisions</h3> <p>Pancake respects individual privacy and values the confidence of its customers, employees, consumers, business partners and others. The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that ensures adequate protection for personal information transferred from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) to the United States (the "U.S.-EU Safe Harbor"). The EEA also has recognized the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection (OJ L 45, 15.2.2001, p.47). The United States Department of Commerce and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland have agreed on a similar set of principles and frequently asked questions to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under Swiss law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from Switzerland to the United States (the “U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor”). Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, Pancake adheres to the principles set forth in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor. Pancake’s Safe Harbor Privacy Policy is available <a href="/safeharbor">here</a> and sets forth the privacy principles established by Pancake with respect to transfers of personal information from the EEA and Switzerland to the United States.</p> <h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3> <p>Pancake reserves the right to amend, restate or otherwise modify this Policy at any time without notice to you. As a user of ShortStack you are required, and hereby agree, to review the Policy frequently. Should Pancake elect to amend, restate or otherwise modify this Policy in a material manner, Pancake will post a notice of such material amendment, restatement or modification on ShortStack so that you may review the changes to the Policy. If you object to any such changes to the Policy, you may, as your sole right and remedy, close your ShortStack account. By continuing to use ShortStack after such notice has been posted on ShortStack.com, you thereby consent to any such changes to the Policy and agree to be bound by the then current version of this Policy.</p> <p>In the event that the terms of this Policy conflict with or are inconsistent with any provision of the Terms and Conditions, the Terms and Conditions shall govern.</p> <p>Any claim under this Policy or otherwise related to ShortStack or Pancake shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada without regard to its conflict of law provisions, and shall be exclusively resolved by a state or federal court located in Washoe County, Nevada. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Washoe County, Nevada, for the purpose of litigating all such claims.</p> <p>If any provision of this Policy is found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be modified so as to render it enforceable and effective to the maximum extent possible in order to effect the intention of the provision; and if a court or arbitrator finds the modified provision invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Policy will not be affected in any way.</p> <p>Any questions on this Policy or the privacy practices of Pancake or ShortStack should be directed to <a href="mailto:contact@shortstacklab.com">contact@shortstacklab.com</a>.</p> <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="follow_bar"> <div class="content"> <div class="three-col"> <div class="col1"> <a href="//www.facebook.com/shortstacklab" target="_blank"><div class="logo social-logos-logo-social-facebook"></div>Facebook </a> </div> <div class="col2"> <a href="//www.twitter.com/shortstacklab" target="_blank"><div class="logo social-logos-logo-social-twitter"></div>Twitter </a> </div> <div class="col3"> <a href="//www.linkedin.com/company/shortstack-com" target="_blank"><div class="logo social-logos-logo-social-linkedin"></div>LinkedIn </a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="content"> <div class="three-col"> <div class="col1"> <p> <a href="/blog">Blog</a> - Yes, it's awesome </p> <p> <a href="/about-facebook-apps">About</a> - Who are these guys anyway? </p> <p> <a href="/facebook-page-faq">FAQs</a> - 97% chance your answer is here </p> <p> <a href="/facebook-page-webinars">Webinars</a> - Helpful weekly webinars </p> <p> <a href="/newsroom">Newsroom</a> - The latest from ShortStack </p> <p> <a href="/case-studies">Case Studies</a> - User success stories </p> </div> <div class="col2"> <p> <a href="/pricing">Pricing</a> - The best deal on the block </p> <p> <a href="/resources">Resources</a> - Making your life easy </p> <p> <a target="_blank" href="//docs.shortstackapp.com/">Help Docs</a> - Everything you need </p> <p> <a href="/support">Support</a> - Need help? </p> <p> <a href="/examples">Examples</a> - Check out our backend </p> <p> <a href="/features">Features</a> - Tools that increase revenue </p> </div> <div class="col3"> <p> <a href="/contact">Contact Us</a> - Drop us a line </p> <p> <a href="/tos/#refunds">Refund Policy</a> - Why we have a free plan </p> <p> <a target="_blank" href="//referral.shortstacklab.com/">Referral Program</a> - Make a couple bucks </p> <p> <a href="/tos">Terms</a> - Don't do anything stupid </p> <p> <a href="/pricing/full-list">Pricing Details</a> - Compare plan features </p> <p> <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> - We won't spam you </p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <div id="ClickTaleDiv"></div> <script>
