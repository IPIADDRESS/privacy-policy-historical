</div>
<div class="panel">
<h3 class="privacy-h3">A. How We Define Personal Information</h3>
<p><b>“Personal information”</b> is any information that identifies you or could be reasonably associated with you. The personal information we collect may include contact information such as your name, email address, home address, and phone numbers, as well as information about the specific products and services that you purchase in our retail stores or from us online, information provided to us in connection with our programs, products and/or services and/or information collected automatically when you interact with us online or visit our retail stores.</p>
<p>Personal information that we collect may include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><b>Personal transactional information,</b> when you make purchases using a <i>PC Financial</i> payment product such as account transactions and the merchants (name, type and location) that you made purchases from. This type of information is also generated by the use of your loyalty and e-commerce accounts and may include information about your purchases</li>
<li><b>Personal financial information,</b> through the use of your <i>PC Financial</i> payment product accounts, such as information about your account balances, account numbers, payment history, credit limits and credit scores</li>
<li><b>Personal health information,</b> through the use of any of our healthcare services provided by pharmacists, dietitians, opticians, nurses, nurse practitioners, respiratory therapists and other healthcare providers which includes any information that identifies or can identify you and relates to the state of your health or the treatment you are receiving. More specifically, personal health information means both diagnostic, treatment and care information, and/or registration information with our healthcare services.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="privacy-h3">B. How We Collect Personal Information</h3>
<p>We collect personal information in the following ways:</p>
<p><b>Directly From You</b></p>
<p>You may provide personal information to us in our stores, by mail, by email, over the telephone, through our websites or mobile applications or in any other direct manner.</p>
<p><u>For example:</u></p>
<p><i>When you voluntarily share information about yourself with us, we will collect that information in order to provide you with our programs, products or services, respond to your inquiry, or for any other purpose disclosed to you at that time.</i></p>
<p><b>From Other Sources</b></p>
<p>Occasionally, we may receive personal information from other sources. In these cases, we receive your personal information from these other sources with your consent or if the law requires or permits us to do so (e.g., to meet our anti-money laundering compliance obligations).</p>
<p><u>For example:</u></p>
<p><i>If you apply for a PC Financial payment product, upon obtaining your consent, we may collect information from credit bureaus in order to process your application and determine whether you qualify for a specific product.</i></p>
<p><b>From Used Technologies at Our Locations</b></p>
<p>We may collect personal information through various types of technologies used in our stores (e.g., grocery, pharmacy). These can include our point-of-sale systems, video surveillance or other similar types of technologies (including, for example, anonymous video analytics which allows us to track the number of individuals in our stores and consider certain demographic information about our customer base on an anonymous basis) which we may use from time to time.</p>
<p><u>For example:</u></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><i>We use video surveillance in areas surrounding our stores, pharmacies, kiosks, pavilions, bank machines, parking lots and other locations: for security purposes, to protect against theft, to prevent damage to our properties, and to prevent fraud.</i></li>
<li><i>We may also use anonymous video analytics to help manage our stores, understand our customer base and improve customer experience.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Through Our Websites and Mobile Applications</b></p>
<p>We may collect certain types of information electronically when you interact with our websites, email, mobile applications, social media accounts, online advertising, or through the use of our or a third party’s technologies, which include <a href="#cookies" aria-label="Link to info on cookies, opens in same page">cookies</a>, <a href="#webbeacons" aria-label="Link to info on web beacons, opens in same page">web beacons</a>, <a href="#webbeacons" aria-label="Link to info on single pixel gifs, opens in same page">single pixel gifs</a> and <a href="#othertech" aria-label="Link to info on other technologies, opens in same page">other technologies</a> such as Data Management Platforms (DMPs). This information helps us understand what actions you take on our websites and mobile applications and allows our websites and mobile applications to work correctly.</p>
<p>We may combine this information with other information collected in-store or online such as your online and in-store transaction history. We do this to support our customer understanding using website and mobile analytics and to provide you with more tailored advertising and marketing campaigns. This includes serving interest-based advertising to you, subject to your right to withdraw consent, as detailed in our <a aria-label="Link to Interest Based Advertising and Media Notice, opens in new tab" href="/content/dam/lclcorp/pdfs/Privacy/Interest-Based-Advertising-and-Media-Notice_Final_Feb5-2019-EN.pdf" ltype="medianotice" lyr="2019" lang="EN" target="_blank">Interest-Based Advertising and Media Notice</a>.</p>
<p><u>For example:</u></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><i>We use your location or language preference to auto-select features when you visit our websites and mobile applications.</i></li>
<li><i>We use your online and/or in-store purchase history to provide you with interest-based advertisements on products that you purchase frequently.</i></li>
<li><i>We collect, combine and categorize your personal information on an aggregated basis to identify online and offline purchasing patterns to help us analyze our businesses to better serve customers.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The technologies we use include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="cookies"><b>Cookies,</b> which are small text files that are saved on your computer when you visit a website so that information can be saved between visits, such as your login credentials or language preferences. For example, cookies allow you to log in quickly when you visit our sites.</li>
<li id="webbeacons"><b>Web beacons,</b> and <b>single pixel gifs,</b> which are small image files that have information about you, such as your IP address, that can be downloaded when you visit a website or open an email. This allows us to understand your online behaviour, monitor our email delivery, and provide you with interest-based advertising. These tools also allow our third-party tracking tools to gather information, such as your IP address, and provide this back to us in an anonymized, aggregate form (i.e. in a manner that prevents us from identifying you personally). Aggregate information refers to personal information compiled and expressed in a summary form where no personal identifiers are included.</li>
<li id="othertech"><b>Other technologies,</b> such as DMP services and analytics engines, which pull usage data from multiple sources and help manage and collect this data to use for personalization, interest-based advertising, customizing content and other methods to gain insights into our customers’ needs and preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google").

<h3 class="privacy-h3">A. Service Providers</h3>
<p>In the course of providing our programs, products, services, promotions, contests and events we may share personal information with our service providers. These service providers help us operate our business, technology systems and applications, internal procedures, infrastructure and advertising and marketing. They provide services to us such as data hosting, contest administration, email deployment, call centre, marketing, sales and processing or analysis of personal information. We require these service providers to limit their access to and/or use of personal information to what is required to provide their services and to comply with our privacy requirements.</p>

<p><i>Personal information collected from contest participants may be shared with our contest administrator to contact selected participants.</i></p>
<h3 class="privacy-h3">B. Third Parties</h3>
<p>In the course of providing certain of our programs, products and services, we may do so through arrangements with third parties. As a result, your personal information may be collected, used and shared by us and the applicable third party. These third parties may have their own privacy policies and terms and conditions, which will govern their use of your personal information. You will be informed upon signing up for the relevant program, product or service of the third party arrangement so that you can review the relevant privacy policies that apply.</p>
<p><u>For example:</u></p>

If your personal information is required in connection with any such transactions, we will comply with the legal requirements for the disclosure of personal information.</p>
<h3 class="privacy-h3">D. Other Permitted Reasons</h3>
<p>Canadian law permits or requires the use, sharing, or disclosure of personal information without consent in specific circumstances (e.g., when investigating and preventing suspected or actual illegal activities, including fraud, or to assist government and law enforcement agencies). These circumstances include situations when permitted or required by law or when necessary to protect our group of companies, our employees, our customers, or others. If this happens, we will not share more personal information than is reasonably required to fulfill that particular purpose.</p>

<h2 class="privacy-h2" id="section7">7. How Do We Protect and Store Personal Information?</h2>
<div class="showBody">
<p>We take the security of your personal information very seriously and are committed to protecting your privacy by using a combination of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. These measures include multi-factor authentication, masking, encryption, logging and monitoring, described below. We store your personal information for as long as it is necessary to provide you with our programs, products, and services and for a reasonable time thereafter, or as permitted or required by law.

<h3 class="privacy-h3">A. How We Protect Personal Information</h3>
<p>To protect your personal information, we maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in our stores, pavilions, kiosks, offices, digital properties, and information storage facilities. By having these safeguards, we aim to avoid the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of your personal information that we hold. These safeguards also apply when we dispose of or destroy your personal information.</p>
<p>For example, where appropriate, we use the following safeguards:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><b>Multi-Factor Authentication,</b> which is a method of confirming your identity by using more than one way to authenticate you, such as asking for your password and a code that is sent to your email address or phone number;</li>
<li><b>Masking,</b> which is the process of obscuring your information so that the structure remains the same but the content is no longer identifiable;</li>
<li><b>Anonymization,</b> which is the process of altering your data so that it can no longer be used to identify you personally;</li>
<li><b>Encryption,</b> which is the process of obscuring your information in order to make it unreadable without the use of a code or a key; and</li>
<li><b>Logging and monitoring,</b> which is the process of tracking, recording and monitoring activity related to the access and/or use of your accounts or personal information.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="privacy-h3">B. Where We Keep Personal Information</h3>
<p>We use all reasonable safeguards, including contractual requirements with our service providers, to protect your personal information wherever it is used or stored. In general, we store, access and use personal information in Canada. Some of our service providers may access, process or store your personal information outside of your province, territory or Canada in the course of providing their services to us. When we engage a service provider that operates outside of Canada, personal information may be stored, processed, accessed or used in another country. In that case, the personal information is subject to the law of the jurisdiction in which it is used or stored, including any law permitting or requiring disclosure of the information to the government, government agencies, courts and law enforcement in that jurisdiction. The countries where our service providers are currently located include the United States, the Netherlands, India, El Salvador and the Philippines.</p>
<h3 class="privacy-h3">C. How Long We Keep Personal Information</h3>
<p>We will store your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, except where otherwise required or permitted by law (e.g., healthcare providers must retain patient records in accordance with their statutory retention obligations). Once no longer required, your personal information will be securely destroyed or anonymized (so the information no longer identifies you).</p>
<p>Please note that if your personal information is collected by a third party, it will be retained in accordance with the privacy policies and records retention requirements of that <a href="#section4" aria-label="Link to info on third party, opens in same page">third party</a>.</p>
