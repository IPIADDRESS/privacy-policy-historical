<div id="priv"> Your privacy is important to us. We want you to feel comfortable 
        using ShopperPress services. Because we gather certain types of information 
        about the users of ShopperPress services, we feel you should fully understand 
        what information we gather and how we use that information. ShopperPress employees 
        are required to familiarize themselves with this privacy policy as a condition 
        of their employment, and any employee violating the policy is subject 
        to disciplinary action. What information does ShopperPress gather? 
        <ul><br>
          <li>What information does ShopperPress gather? 
            <ul>
              <li>When you register for a account on this website, ShopperPress obtains 
                contact information, such as your name, address, and phone number. 
                When you use ShopperPress service, our systems record information 
                about your session, such as the dates and times of use, and the 
                specific Internet address assigned to you. ShopperPress also tracks 
                requests you make for information on ShopperPress products and services, 
                and responses you provide to ShopperPress surveys. Finally, ShopperPress 
                keeps records of your payment history and communications you have 
                with ShopperPress support team. Except in extraordinary circumstances 
                (when we receive a court order, to protect the company's rights 
                or property, or in emergencies where someone's safety is at risk), 
                ShopperPress does not keep track of what sites you visit when you 
                are using the service.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>What does ShopperPress do with this information? 
            <ul>
              <li>ShopperPress uses the information it gathers in order to provide 
                you with the best online experience possible. As you might expect, 
                contact information is used to contact you concerning your account 
                and our company. Payment information is used to validate your 
                identity and to bill you for the services and products you order. 
                Information on your online sessions is used to allocate system 
                resources and to ensure compliance with ShopperPress Service Level 
                Agreements (SLA). Information on your communications with ShopperPress 
                support team is used to address the issues raised by your communications. 
                In addition, ShopperPress regularly sends out mailings regarding the 
                operation of its service and other goods and services that it 
                believes may be of interest to you. You may request that ShopperPress 
                not send you mailings relating to other goods and services at 
                the URLs listed in this section or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@datingscripts.co.uk">privacy@datingscripts.co.uk</a>. 
                ShopperPress reserves the right, however, to send bulletins and other 
                important information regarding the service at its discretion.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Does ShopperPress share subscriber information with third parties? 
            <ul>
              <li>ShopperPress will not share or disclose information regarding its 
                subscribers except (i) when we receive legal process such as a 
                court order; (ii) when reasonably necessary to protect the company's 
                rights or property; or (iii) in emergencies where someone's safety 
                is at risk.<br>
                <br>
                You should be aware, however, that any information that you disclose 
                in a public space such as a chat room, bulletin board, or personal 
                Web site, ShopperPress DNR domain registration is freely available 
                to anyone else visiting that space. ShopperPress cannot safeguard 
                any personally identifiable information you disclose in these 
                locations, nor can it ensure that information you voluntarily 
                supply to third parties remains private. Please review the privacy 
                policies of third party sites you frequent to ensure that your 
                privacy preferences are respected.</li>
              <li>ShopperPress trial customer email addresses will be added to our 
                newsletter database to help us provide you with the latest information 
                about the products and/or services we offer.</li>

          </li>
          <li>How can I correct or update the information? 
            <ul>
              <li>To request a copy of the contact ShopperPress has on your account, 
                send an e-mail request to <a href="mailto:privacy@datingscripts.co.uk">privacy@datingscripts.co.uk</a>. 
                You may correct that information as appropriate by returning a 
                message to the same address. Please keep in mind that under ShopperPress 
                Service Level Agreements (SLA), subscribers are required to provide 
                ShopperPress with current contact and billing information. ShopperPress 
                may require a copy of a government issued form of identification 
                before disclosing billing information or before making changes 
                to the billing or contact information on an account.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>What happens to the information if I leave ShopperPress? 
            <ul>
              <li>If you ever leave ShopperPress, ShopperPress will normally delete your 
                personally identifiable account information twelve months after 
                the account is cancelled, unless we are under a legal obligation 
                to retain it. We preserve account information for this short period 
                of time in the event you wish to reactivate your account and retain 
                your previous e-mail address. However, in the event of any accounting 
                irregularities, ShopperPress reserves the right to retain your contact 
                and billing information as necessary to resolve the matter.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Changes to this policy and questions about privacy. 
            <ul>
              <li>ShopperPress reserves the right to make changes to this policy.
