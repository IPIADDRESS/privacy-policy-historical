<span class="TEXT2">Privacy Policy</span>
<br><br>
AOL is committed to protecting its members' privacy and securely stores any
information we may have about you.  In addition to AOL's Privacy Policy, the
following explains how AOL collects, stores, and uses information you
provide through your use of the AOLbyPhone service:
<br><br>
One feature of AOLbyPhone allows you to check your AOL e-mail by having
our computer system read your e-mail aloud to you.  No person reads,
reviews, opens or otherwise monitors your e-mail.  The process is entirely
automated.
<br><br>
In addition to the account number, password and other information you
provide at registration, AOL's system automatically gathers information
about which features of the AOLbyPhone service you use and how often you use
them ("General Usage Information").  We may use General Usage Information to
help personalize the AOLbyPhone service and enhance the speed at which you
can access its features.  For example, if you consistently use a certain
feature of the service, we may use General Usage Information to shorten or
customize the voice menu to reflect your familiarity with the service.
Additionally, AOL may use General Usage Information to alert you to other
features of the AOLbyPhone service.  AOL may also use aggregate data based
on our members' General Usage Information in order to determine how our
members use different parts of the service and to improve the features and
functionality of AOLbyPhone.  AOL will not use General Usage Information for
any other purpose other than to improve your experience on the AOLbyPhone
service.
<br><br>
AOL may use your AOLbyPhone registration data to update our records
concerning your AOL membership.  We may use this registration data, as well
as data about the kinds of products you buy from AOL or how frequently you
use the service, to extend special marketing offers to you.  However, as
described in the main AOL privacy policy, you may choose not to receive
these marketing offers.  Finally, AOL may use other information you have
voluntarily provided on other AOL services to help personalize your use of
AOLbyPhone (for example, stock portfolios you establish on AOL or
my.aol.com).
<br><br>
The telephone carrier you use to call the AOLbyPhone service, or another
third party such as the manufacturer of your phone, may provide AOL with the
phone number from which you are calling (unless you have instructed the
carrier to block caller ID) and certain additional information, such as the
location from which you are calling.  AOL may use this information on a
temporary basis during your session to personalize your AOLbyPhone
experience, including, for example, to help deliver the local weather to you
or to provide you advertisements about local products and services.  AOL
does not, however, store information provided by the telephone carrier.
<br><br>
AOL uses state-of-the-art technology to keep your individual information
as secure as possible.  AOL also has put in place privacy protection control
systems designed to keep your personal data safe and private.  Be aware,
however, that if you call the AOLbyPhone  service from a wireless phone, the
call runs the same risk of being intercepted as with any wireless service.
Similarly, when speaking on a phone in a public area, you should be aware
that others might overhear information relating to your account login and
PIN number.  You should exercise appropriate care to protect this
information, or use the keyboard features.
<br><br>
AOL will not share information you provide during registration or General
Usage Information with third parties, except that AOL may share such
information with partners who are working with AOL if doing so is necessary
to provide the content or features of the service, or is necessary to
complete a transaction you have requested.  AOL may, however, release
specific information about your account to comply with valid legal process
such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, on in special cases such
as a physical threat to you or others.
<br><br>
In the future, the AOLbyPhone service may provide a calling service
feature that will allow you to make short telephone calls in connection with
your use of AOLbyPhone.  For example, if you go to the Restaurant Guides
area and find a restaurant at which you would like to make a reservation,
you might be able to ask the AOLbyPhone service to initiate a call to that
restaurant.  After finishing the call, you would be able to return to the
AOLbyPhone service by keying in "**" on your touchtone pad.  AOL will not
intercept, monitor, or record the contents of any telephone call made using
the AOLbyPhone service, though it may keep a record of the telephone number
or identity of the establishment you called through the service.  The
telephony service for this feature is provided by a third-party.
<br><br>
If the privacy policy for the AOLbyPhone service changes, we will post those
changes at keyword "AOLbyPhone" so that you will always know what
information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will
disclose it to anyone.
