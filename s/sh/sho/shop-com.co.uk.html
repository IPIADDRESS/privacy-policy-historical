</p><p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Information Collection and Use</div>
We want you to feel safe while visiting any site developed or managed by SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM. We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust in us to do so carefully and sensibly. Your use of this website constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes. The information we learn from customers helps us personalise and continually improve the shopping experience at SHOP.COM. Here are the types of information we gather:

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</div>
As with most websites, when you visit SHOP.COM, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically collected and later analysed, which may include the following: computer and connection information such as the type of browser you use, the server name, operating system, platform and IP address through which you access the internet; the date and time you access the site; purchase history (which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers to create special features, such as Top Sellers and Most Popular); the full URL (Uniform Resource Locator) clickstream to, through and from our Web site; cookie numbers; products you viewed or searched for; and the number of sessions held on our Web site. During some visits, we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as clicks, rollovers and scrolling), and methods used to browse away from the page. This information is not personally identifiable.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Personally Identifiable Information (PII):</div>
Personally Identifiable Information is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to contact you. For example, your name, address, telephone/fax number, social security number, credit card number, email address or any information you submitted to us that identifies you individually. PII may be collected by SHOP.COM if you choose to communicate with us through email, via this website, by telephone, in writing, by placing an order, by completing a user registration form or online survey, by creating an address book, using our Shopping or Gift Services (including eGifts, Gift Certificates, Gift Registry, Bridal Registry, Reminder Service), or participating in a rebate offer, contest or sweepstakes. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. You can visit and browse SHOP.COM without revealing personally identifiable information about yourself.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Information from other sources:</div>
We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Examples include: updated postal and email information, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily; purchase confirmation, order status, and shipping information from our partner stores to better service your orders or requests placed with these partners through SHOP.COM, and search results and links (including paid listings such as Sponsored Links from Google), and other behavioral or psychographic data that help us to provide an improved experience while visiting our site.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Use of Personally Identifiable Information:</div>
SHOP.COM may use PII collected primarily for such purposes as helping to establish and verify the identity of users; opening, maintaining, administering and servicing user accounts; processing, servicing or enforcing transactions and sending related communications; providing services and support to users such as eGifts, Gift Certificates, Gift Registry, Bridal Registry, Reminders, rebates, contests &amp; sweepstakes, and address books; improving the website, including tailoring it to users' preferences; providing users with service or product updates, promotional notices and offers; responding to your questions, inquiries, comments and instructions; maintaining the security and integrity of our systems.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Use of Cookies:</div>
We may obtain non-personally identifiable information by placing a "cookie" on your computer's hard drive so we can recognise you as a return user and personalise your experience. A cookie is a piece of data that enables us to track and target your preferences. The cookie will be stored on your computer's hard drive until you remove it. We may also use temporary or "session" cookies to help you shop. These cookies will expire when you place an order. As with most internet browsers, you can erase this information from your computer's hard drive, block all cookies or even receive a warning before a cookie is placed on your system. Click on your browser's Help button for more information. If you reject our cookies, you may still use our site, but you may be limited in the use of many of our features, including the shopping basket and checkout areas. Some of our business partners may also use cookies on our site; however, we have no access to, or control over, these cookies and do not accept any responsibility for such use.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Opt out Choices &amp; Sharing of Data</div>
<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Opt Out Choices:</div>
SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM gives you the option to opt out from receiving offers from us and the stores that you've made purchases from on our site. You can opt out by de-selecting "Sign up to receive email announcements and take advantage of special savings from SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM" and de-selecting "Make my email address available to stores that I order from on SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM." You can do this de-selecting (or re-selecting) action during the registration process or by going to the privacy settings in your account area (Your Account) after you've registered. You can also opt out by emailing us, phoning us or writing us, using the contact information provided above. If you do not wish to receive offers from our marketing partners, simply leave that checkbox unchecked. Additionally, if you have previously agreed to receive offers from our stores, and would like to discontinue receiving these offers, you can do so by following the simple opt out procedures they provide in the email or contacting them directly.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Sharing with Our Partner Stores:</div>
If you have agreed to receive offers from our stores, we will provide them your contact information when we forward your order or catalogue request to them. They will then include you on their mailing list. If you have agreed to receive email offers from our stores, they will include you on their email marketing list.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Sharing with Third-Party Marketers</div>
We do not rent, share or sell your personal information to third-party marketers. Should this policy change in the future, we will not do so without your prior consent.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Sharing with Third-Party Advertisers &amp; Links to Other Sites:</div>
Our site includes third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable information to these advertisers or third-party websites. Some examples of these companies include Google, Advertising.com, Shopping.com and Trilegiant. These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalise advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Using Third-Party Data to Improve Our Marketing Efforts on Your Behalf</div>
SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM is constantly improving the service and products we provide our customers. To aid us in serving you better, we may combine non-personally identifiable information available from our records with information available from other sources. SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM may also hire third parties to help us in analysis of our customer data or the development of new products, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive data from customer lists, providing marketing assistance, providing customer service, and providing search results and links. As a result, these third parties may be given access to some or all of the information you provide to SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM that is needed to perform their functions, but they may not use it for other purposes. SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM requires these third parties to maintain your information in the strictest confidence and to ensure that they honor the privacy settings you have selected for the handling of your personal information on the SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM site. We use Verisign to provide credit card fraud checking services on our site. When you purchase from SHOP.COM we will share your credit card details as necessary for the third party to provide that service. Verisign is prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Security</div>
Our website takes every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information, that information is protected both online and offline. Website security is reviewed regularly to ensure we are up to date with industry standards and technology. Whether you're ordering a catalog or making a purchase, we want you to feel safe and secure while visiting SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM. You can feel confident making purchases from established partner sites that have been in business for many years. To ensure that your credit card information is even more secure, we use secure sockets layer (SSL) software (which encrypts the information you input) when you give us your credit card information. We encrypt all credit card information and store it on a server that isn't accessible on the Internet. Once we store that information, it can not be displayed anywhere on SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM. Internally, SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM takes extra caution to limit access to customers' information. Only a few individuals within the company are given degrees of access to customers' personal information according to job function and necessity. Access is granted to these employees through special passwords. All employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure guarded environment.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Log Files and Other Tracking Information</div>
SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM uses our Web server log files to help track the performance of our site. We do not tie the IP addresses within the log files to your personally identifiable information. In addition to cookies (as described above), we employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Child Use</div>
SHOP.COM does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use SHOP.COM only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Legal Disclaimer</div>
We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our website.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Notification of Changes</div>
Our business changes constantly and our Privacy Policy will change accordingly. We may email periodic reminders of changes to our Privacy Policy, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Changes to Your Personal Information</div>
The personal information you enter during registration and/or during checkout is stored in your personal account area, also known as Your Account. You can access Your Account to add or change information, including changing your privacy settings, by entering the email address and the password you created you used when you registered. You also have the ability to add new credit card or delivery information to Your Account when placing an order. If you have elected to store your credit card information with us, we only display the last five digits of your credit card number in the saved payment methods in the Your Account section. The full credit card information is stored on secure offline servers. For more information on how we protect your credit card information, see our Security section.

<p>
</p><div class="about_h2">Links</div>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, SHOP<section type="THEDOT">•</section>COM, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
