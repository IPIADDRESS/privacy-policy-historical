Our website takes every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information, that information is protected both online and offline. Website security is reviewed regularly to ensure we are up to date with industry standards and technology. 
Whether you're ordering a catalog or making a purchase, we want you to feel safe and secure while visiting SHOP<span class="thedot">•</span>COM. You can feel confident making purchases from established catalogs that have been in business for many years. To ensure that your credit card information is even more secure, use our secure transmission (SSL) when you give us your credit card information.

Once we shop that information, it can not be displayed anywhere on SHOP<span class="thedot">•</span>COM. 
Internally, SHOP<span class="thedot">•</span>COM takes extra caution to limit access to customers' information. Only a few individuals within the company are given degrees of access to customers' personal information according to job function and necessity. Access is granted to these employees through special passwords. All employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that we shop personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure guarded environment.
