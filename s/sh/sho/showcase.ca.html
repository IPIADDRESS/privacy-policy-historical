        any personal information. However, to make use of certain features on 
        our site, such as contests, quizzes, promotions, personalized services,

        Atlantis may request contact information (such as name, mailing address, 
        e-mail address, etc.) and other data required for operating these services.

        contact the contestant to promote products and services) and/or distribution 
        to third parties who may participate in chatrooms and bulletin boards 
        on the web site(s). You are under no obligation to provide us with this 
        personal information and can access and enjoy many parts of the Alliance 
        Atlantis web site(s) without providing us any personal information. However, 
        for clarity, please understand that by volunteering this personal information 
        you are also agreeing to its collection, use and distribution for the
