        									<h1>Privacy Policy and Notice</h1>
<p>
This is the privacy notice of <i>www2.shopodo.co.uk</i>. In this document, “we” or “us” refers to <i>nexico Consulting GmbH</i>.<br>
<br>
We are company number HRB 10693 registered in Germany.<br>
Our registered office is at:<br>
<br>
Hansestrasse 21<br>
18182 Bentwisch<br>
<br>
This is a notice to tell you our policy about all information that we record about you. It covers both information that could identify you and information that could not.<br>
<br>
We are extremely concerned to protect your privacy and confidentiality.  We understand that all users of our web site are quite rightly concerned to know that their data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party. Our policy is both specific and strict. It complies with UK law and with the laws of all jurisdictions of which we are aware. If you think our policy falls short of your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, do please tell us.<br>
<br>
We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our web site immediately.<br>
<br>
Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information collected at this site.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of the information we collect from you, either through our web site or because you give it to us in some other way, and why it is necessary to collect it:<br>
<br>
1. Basic identification and contact information, such as your name and contact details.<br>
This information is used:<br>
1.1. to provide you with the services which you request;<br>
1.2. for verifying your identity for security purposes;<br>
1.3. for marketing our services and products;<br>
1.4. Information which does not identify any individual may be used in a general way by us or third parties, to provide class information, for example relating to demographics or usage of a particular page or service.<br>
<br>
2. Market place information<br>
When we obtain information from you specifically to enable you to buy a service offered on our web site by some other person, we assume that in giving us your information, you are also giving us permission to pass it to the relevant person.<br>
<br>
3. Your domain name and e-mail address are recognised by our servers and the pages that you visit are recorded. We shall not under any circumstances divulge your e-mail address to any person who is not an employee or contractor of ours and who does not need to know, either generally or specifically. This information is used:<br>
<br>
3.1. to correspond with you or deal with you as you expect.<br>
3.2. in a collective way not referable to any particular individual, for the purpose of quality control and improvement of our site;<br>
3.3. to send you news about the services to which you have signed up;<br>
3.4. to tell you about other of our services or services of sister web sites.<br>
<br>
4. Information you post on our website<br>
Information you send to us by posting to a forum or blog or in your advertisement is stored on our servers. We do not specifically use that information except to allow it to be read, but you will see in our terms and conditions that we reserve a right to use it in any way we decide.<br>
<br>
5. Website usage information<br>
We may use software embedded in our website (such as JavaScript) to collect  information about which pages you view and how you reach them, what you do when you visit a page, the length of time you remain on the page, and how we perform in providing content to you. [We do not presently associate such information with an identifiable person]<br>
<br>
6. Financial information relating only to your credit cards<br>
This information is never taken by us either through our website or otherwise.  At the point of payment, you are transferred to a secure page on the website of other reputable payment service provider. That page may be dressed in our “livery”, but it is not controlled by us. Our staff and contractors never have access to it.<br>
<br>
7. Note on padlock symbols and other trust marks<br>
Many companies offer certification and an icon or other small graphic to prove to site visitors that the site is safe. Some certify to a high level of safety. Others are more concerned to take our money than to provide a useful service. We do not handle information about your credit card so do not subscribe to any such service. However, we suggest you assess this notice to judge that we do take your privacy seriously.<br>
<br>
8. Financial information about your direct debit or your credit cards<br>
When you have agreed to set up a direct debit arrangement, the information you have given to us is passed to our own bank Postbank Hamburg for processing according to our instructions. We do not keep a copy.<br>
<br>
We are registered under the direct debit guarantee scheme.  (This provides for the customer’s bank to refund disputed payments without question, pending further investigation. Direct debits can only be set up for payments to beneficiaries that are approved "originators" of direct debits. In order to be approved, these beneficiaries are subjected to careful vetting procedures. Once approved, they are required to give indemnity guarantees through their banks.)<br>
<br>
9. We retain your credit card information securely<br>
We [may] keep your financial information to provide you with a better shopping experience next time you visit us and to prevent fraud.<br>
<br>
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates to verify our identity to your browser, and to encrypt any data you give us when you buy, including financial information such as credit or debit card numbers. Our SSL certificate encryption level is 128-bit/256-bit. Whenever we ask for financial information, you can check that SSL is being used by looking for a closed padlock symbol or other trust mark in your browser URL bar or toolbar.<br>
<br>
We take the following measures to protect your financial information:<br>
<br>
9.1. We keep your financial information encrypted on our servers.<br>
9.2. We do not keep all your data, so as to prevent the possibility of our duplicating a transaction without a new instruction from you.<br>
9.3. Access to your information is restricted to authorised staff only.<br>
9.4. We automatically delete your information [after X days OR when the card expires].<br>
9.5. If we ask you questions about your financial information, we shall show partial detail [the first four OR the last four digits of the debit or credit card number], only enough to identify the card(s) to which we refer.<br>
<br>
10. Credit reference<br>
To assist in combatting fraud, we share information with credit reference agencies so far as it relates to clients or customers who instruct their credit card issuer to cancel payment to us without having first provided an acceptable reason to us and given us the opportunity to refund their money.<br>
<br>
11. Business and personal information<br>
This includes all information given to us in the course of your business and ours, such as information you give us in your capacity as our client.  We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship.  It is not used for any other purpose.  We expect you to reciprocate this policy.<br>
<br>
We keep information which forms part of our business record for a minimum of six years. That is because we may need it in some way to support a claim or defence in court. That is also the period within which our tax collecting authorities may demand to know it.<br>
<br>

In doing so, those parties, their agents or other companies working for them may use technology that automatically collects your IP address when they send an advertisement that appears on our site to your browser.

We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and, if we do, what that information is.<br>
<br>
We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.<br>
<br>
17. Third party content<br>
Our web site is a publishing medium in that anyone may register and then publish information about himself or some other person. We do not moderate or control what is posted.  If you complain about any of the content on our web site, we shall investigate your complaint. If we feel it may be justified, we shall remove it while we investigate. Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a judgement as to whose right will be obstructed: yours, or that of the person who posted the content which offends you. If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.<br>
<br>

<br>
22. Affiliate information<br>
This is information given to us by you in your capacity as an affiliate of us or a customer or client of ours. Such information is retained for business use only.

We expect any affiliate to agree to reciprocate this policy. As an exception to this, we have the right to disclose your first name and URL of your affiliate connection to other affiliates and to any other person or organisation, on and off site.
