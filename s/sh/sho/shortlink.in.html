<h3>› Our Privacy Policy</h3>
<br><br>

<p>ShortLink.in's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. ShortLink.in will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent.
<br><br>
ShortLink.in shares aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we will say ShortLink.in's members consist of x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to target content and advertising.
<br><br>
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our members is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing a secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
<br><br>
As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, ShortLink.in.com can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
<br><br>
ShortLink.in may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) ShortLink.in rights or property, other ShortLink.in users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. ShortLink.in may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
