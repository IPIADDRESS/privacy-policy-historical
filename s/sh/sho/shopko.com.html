        Internet Privacy Policy </font></strong> </h2>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following privacy 
        statement applies to Pamida and its subsidiaries’ websites ("Pamida 
        website" or “Site”), except for the portions of the Site 
        which are operated by our retail partners and subject to their own privacy 
        statements. In addition, Pamida has adopted <a href="/privacy/noticeofprivacy-pamida.html">Privacy 
        Practices</a> in accordance with HIPAA.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pamida 
        makes every effort to create an online environment that is safe, easy, 
        and respects your privacy. We won't sell, rent or give information which 
        identifies you personally (“personal information”) to anyone 
        if you've told us not to. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rest of this statement 
        outlines in more detail the kind of information we collect and what we 
        do with it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1. When you visit 
        Pamida websites, our web server automatically recognizes 
        your domain name, your computer's operating system, browser type, the 
        address of the web page you're coming from and of those pages you visit 
        on our Site. We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our 
        customers use parts of our Site so we can improve it. We may also match 
        user information with offline data available from other sources in order 
        to carry out our services and conduct our advertising and promotions more 
        effectively. We do not automatically recognize or collect your name, home 
        address or telephone number. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. During your visit 
        to Pamida websites, we use “cookies” to store 
        and sometimes track information. A “cookie” is a small amount 
        of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your 
        computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us who you 
        are and enable us to access your information so you do not have to re-enter 
        it; gather statistical information about usage by registered or unregistered 
        users; research visiting patterns; help target advertisements based on 
        user interests; assist our retail partners in the tracking of visits and 
        the processing of orders; and track the progress and participation in 
        promotions. In some instances, our retail partners and advertisers appearing 
        on our Site may use their own cookies. Preference and options configurations 
        in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. You can 
        change those configurations on your computer if you desire. By changing 
        your preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when 
        a cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies. If you do so and cookies 
        are disabled, you may be required to re-enter your information more often 
        and certain features on our Site may be unavailable. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Pamida websites uses contractors (other companies hired by us) to perform 
        some services, such as processing, fulfilling and delivering orders, sending 
        postal mail and e-mail, and updating customer information. These contractors 
        have access only to the personal information needed to perform these services, 
        and they are prohibited from using such information for any other purpose. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. When you register, 
        enter a contest, participate in an e-mail program, or make a purchase 
        using a credit card, we or our contractors may collect some or all of 
        the following information: your user ID, password, name, shipping and 
        billing addresses, shipping and billing phone numbers, card type, card 
        number, card expiration date, and optional personal information. This 
        information is used by us or our contractors to bill you for your purchase, 
        ship your order, send e-mail notices, or verify and ship a contest prize. 
        It may also be shared with our vendors who co-sponsor a contest and our 
        other retail partners only for the express purposes of our original intent. 
        You can be assured that your credit card information and other data given 
        during the order process will be guarded with the highest levels of security 
        and confidentiality.<br>
        All orders placed on our Site are encrypted using SSL technology, so your 
        transactions are protected. With SSL in place for both the client and 
        the server, the information sent via the Internet will be transmitted 
        securely using the SSL technology. To be sure your connection is secure 
        when filling out the order form, simply check for the padlock icon in 
        the bottom border of your browser window. The icon should be visible and 
        show the lock in the locked position.<br>
        Important note: E-mail is not encrypted and is not a secure means of sending 
        credit card information. Please place all orders through the order form 
        or over the telephone. Do not attempt to e-mail an order. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. We archive correspondence 
        of those who communicate with us via e-mail. This information may be used 
        to follow up with you. If you supply us with your postal address or telephone 
        number online or via e-mail, we will use that address to contact you regarding 
        information you requested. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. We may use your 
        personal information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, 
        to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product 
        offerings and to customize our Site's content, layout, and features. We 
        may also use your information to furnish you with items targeted to your 
        interests, such as new products, services and promotions. We may notify 
        you of these new items via e-mail, telephone, or direct mail. To “opt 
        out” of receiving anything from Pamida websites, simply 
        unsubscribe. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. From time to time, 
        we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses. If our information 
        practices significantly change at some time in the future, these changes 
        will be reflected within the privacy policy you are reading now. It is 
        our intent that at no time will your privacy be compromised, and you'll 
        always be asked if you want to opt out of any of these new uses. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We do not sell or 
        otherwise market your information to unaffiliated third parties except 
        when necessary to service or process customer orders or requests. We may 
        contact you on occasion to provide you with information regarding our 
        products and services or to solicit feedback. </font></p>
