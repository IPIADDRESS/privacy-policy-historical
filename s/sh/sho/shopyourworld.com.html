                When you use our Site, we collect and store your personal information from you.
                Our primary goal in doing so is to provide a safe, efficient, smooth and customized
                experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet
                your needs, and to customize our Site to make your experience safer and easier.
                Importantly, we only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary
                for achieving this purpose. In general, you can browse the Site without telling
                us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give
                us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. To fully use our Site,
                you will need to register using our online registration form, where you may be required
                to provide us with your contact and identity information, residence / place of business
                information, billing information, shipping information, bank account details and
                other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. Where
                possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You
                always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular
                service or feature on the Site. You may provide us with a SHOP YOUR WORLD ID. We
                may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior on
                our site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics,
                interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve our users. This
                information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. This information may
                include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not),
                which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), your computer
                browser information, and your IP address.<br>
                We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Site to
                help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust
                and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in
                providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through
                the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less
                frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is
                targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they
                are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are
                always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case
                you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required
                to reenter your password more frequently during a session. Additionally, you may
                encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Site that are
                placed by third parties. For example, if you view a web page created by a user,
                there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control the use of
                cookies by third parties.<br>
                If you choose to buy on the Site, we collect information about your buying behavior.

                some additional information, such as a billing address, a credit card number and
                a credit card expiration date and tracking information from cheques or money orders.<br>
                If you choose to post messages on our message boards, chat rooms or other message
                areas or leave feedback for other users, we will collect that information you provide
                to us. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer
                support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.<br>
                If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users
                or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the
                Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.<br>
