               <p>This Privacy Policy covers <a href="#certified">TRUSTe Certified Subsites</a> listed below. The Certified Subsites are controlled by Fujitsu Management Services of America, Inc., Fujitsu Interconnect
                  Technologies Limited, Fujitsu Microelectronics America, Inc., Fujitsu Network Communications, Inc., Fujitsu Consulting Inc.,
                  Fujitsu Computer Systems Corporation, Fujitsu Computer Products of America, Inc., Fujitsu Components America, Inc., Fujitsu
                  Laboratories of America, Inc., Fujitsu Media Devices of America, Inc., and Fujitsu Transaction Solutions, Inc. We are all
                  affiliates of Fujitsu Limited, a Japanese corporation.  Throughout this privacy policy, when we say, “our”, “we”, “us”, or
                  “Fujitsu”, we mean the Fujitsu companies identified above. Our Certified Subsites have privacy policies that carry the TRUSTe
                  certification, but websites of other affiliates may not. We are participants in the TRUSTe Program, and are using the TRUSTe
                  Mark(s) under license from TRUSTe pursuant to the requirements of the TRUSTe program; each Fujitsu company listed above will
                  be individually certified by TRUSTe.  All rights in the TRUSTe Mark(s) belong to TRUSTe.
               </p>
               <p>On the <a href="#certified">Certified Subsites</a>, each page where personally identifiably information is collected has a Privacy link to the applicable privacy policy. Click
                  on the Privacy link to identify how the information collected on that portion of the website will be used.  To identify the
                  URLs of the Certified Subsites, refer to the <a href="#certified">coverage chart</a> below. Certain affiliate sites that are not TRUSTe certified (“<a href="#uncertified">Uncertified Sites</a>”) are also listed separately on the coverage chart. Uncertified Sites are covered under different privacy policies - so before
                  providing personal information to those sites, check the <a href="#uncertified">applicable privacy policy</a>.

               <p>This policy describes the potential use of visitor information on the Certified Subsites. Some Certified Subsites may make
                  far less use of personal information than we have outlined in the policy, but we wanted to provide you with an inclusive statement
                  of our potential practices.  The following sections below explain the privacy policy for the Certified Subsites only:

               <p>We may collect information from users as described below, such as name, address, email, purchase details, company name, position,
                  inquiry details, telephone numbers, and credit card/payment information, for the following purposes:
               </p>
               <p><strong>To respond to requests and inquiries.</strong> To respond to requests for sales or product information, support or contact inquiries, event or training registration, downloads,
                  warranties, e-commerce transactions, newsletters, surveys or contests; and share it with Fujitsu affiliates, resellers and
                  distributors, consultants and service providers, both domestically and internationally, as a general matter, to fulfill these
                  and other purposes.
               </p>
               <p><strong>As part of the communication connection itself.</strong>  We may collect any information your browser provides such as network routing ( IP address, referring URL, domain names,
                  landing page, forward proxy), browser type and locale, web statistics (pages viewed, order, date, time) and a query to see
                  if there are "cookies" previously set by the Site.  This is for website statistical analysis, user verification, to facilitate
                  log in, maintain an external application session, or other site navigation procedures. We may use hosted 3rd party web analytical
                  services to track and report on visitor behavior on our certified websites. These services may set a small piece of tracking
                  code that uses Fujitsu domains’ information stored in cookies on the visitor’s hard drive. A cookie is a small piece of information
                  sent by a Web server to store on a Web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. While we don't offer an opt-out
                  on the site for cookies, browsers may provide you with optional control over cookies.
               </p>
               <p><strong>To engage in transactions or communications.</strong>  Name, address, email, purchase details, telephone numbers, and credit card/payment information may be collected and stored
                  as part of the transaction history. We may need to share some of this information (address, payment) with our affiliates,
                  third party service providers such as delivery services, credit card clearing houses and other third parties that are required
                  to accomplish the transaction. We, our affiliates, or our third party service providers, may also collect billing information
                  and payment information such as credit card number to perform the online sale. Certain specific information such as bank account
                  number or social security number are only required if a leasing agreement is being entered into.  Affiliates and third party
                  service providers are only allowed to use the information provided for to accomplish the transaction and not for other purposes.
               </p>
               <p><strong>To facilitate e-commerce transactions.</strong> Some parts of Certified Subsites use cookies to avoid duplicate data entry, keep track of shopping cart additions, and preserve
                  order information between sessions. Cookies on the Site may contain the following information: a unique identifier, user preferences
                  and profile information. Some cookies used by the Site may remain on the user's computer after they leave the Site, and expire
                  within 30 - 365 days.  However some persistent cookies have no expiration.
               </p>
               <p><strong>To provide sales, service and support, respond to user inquiries, registration for newsletters, product information and quotes
                     for product and equipment purchase.</strong> We may share contact information, both domestically and internationally, with the appropriate Fujitsu affiliate, group sales
                  person, distributor, reseller, service provider or consultant to fulfill your request.
               </p>
               <p><strong>To select content and tailor marketing to user needs.</strong> Information collected from site navigation, log files, and forms may be used to display web site content and navigation that
                  is most relevant. Information from purchases, registration and inquiries may be used to provide you with notices of product
                  releases and service developments that address your needs and requirements. Marketing notices are subject to the general opt-out
                  elections.
               </p>
               <p><strong>To provide information on educational events or relevant programs.</strong> We occasionally co-sponsor events with alliance partners that provide services of potential benefit to Fujitsu customers.
                  We may provide information on such events and services to users who have indicated interest in the subject matter or service.
               </p>
               <p><strong>To power joint sales or product promotions.</strong> Fujitsu and its alliance partners may engage in joint events or provide bundled products. Such promotions will always reference
                  the channel or alliance partners involved. Examples could include: joint seminars and sales promotions, jointly developed
                  products and joint announcements. Fujitsu and our alliance partner(s) will have access to that information. We may have no
                  control over privacy practices of alliance partner(s), so we advise you to review the privacy policies of these alliance partners
                  before providing any personal information.
               </p>
               <p><strong>To follow up on your registration for or attendance at a Fujitsu event.</strong> Users, who sign up for an event or training session may be contacted to see if any follow up is appropriate. This is in addition
                  to any contact that may be required to confirm payment or provide logistical information and updates related to the conference
                  or training session. Please consult the supplemental privacy statement on the specific conference site for more information.
               </p>
               <p><strong>To address performance and repair issues.</strong> On occasion we offer patches and other fixes to software, such as security patches addressing newly discovered vulnerabilities,
                  as well as drivers for hardware. We may communicate the availability of these to registered owners of Fujitsu products or
                  channel partners.
               </p>
               <p><strong>To comply with laws and law enforcement.</strong> We may provide personally identifiable information to comply with law enforcement, legal processes, and legally mandated
                  reporting and disclosure.
               </p>
               <p><strong>To offer participation in surveys or contests.</strong> We may provide you with the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you decide to participate,
                  we will request information such as your name, email, shipping address to notify contest winner and award prizes. This information
                  is also used to send participants an email newsletter with marketing information on new product offerings and services. We
                  may collect additional personal information to confirm your eligibility for a prize. We may use a third party service provider
                  to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information
                  for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information that is collected through a survey or contest
                  with other third parties, unless prior notification is given.
               </p>
               <p><strong>To engage third party service providers to perform services.</strong> We will put in place reasonable restrictions to maintain proper use of your personal information by such providers.
               </p>
               <p><strong>Referral Service.</strong> We may provide functionality for you to send, as a one-time email, a page, product information or job opportunity to a friend.
                  We do not retain personal information gathered in this transaction.

                  Please see the following section for opt-out instructions. You will still receive other communications, such as for support,
                  patches or warranty updates.

                  data prior to your opt-out.  Opt-out only covers commercial email marketing to a specific email address and does not otherwise
                  limit our use of your information consistent with this privacy policy.  For example, we still could use your data for certain
                  communications including patch, driver, warranty, performance of transactions, communications to channel partners, and some
                  limited communications related to registration for and attendance at events.
