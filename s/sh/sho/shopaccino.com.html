           <ol class="padding0">
               <li><h4>Personal information you choose to provide</h4>

                  <li><h4>Website use details</h4>
                    <p>Similar to other  commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called  “cookies” and web server log files to collect information about how our website  is used. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include  the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our website, and  the websites visited just before and just after our website.</p>
                 </li>
                 
                 <li><h4>Saving of collected  information</h4>
                 	<p>The security of your  personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information  (such as credit card numbers) on our website, we encrypt that information using  secure socket layer technology (SSL). When credit card details are collected,  we simply pass them on in order to be processed as required. We never  permanently store complete credit card details.<br>
                  We follow generally  accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to  us, both during transmission and once we receive it.</p>

                 <li>
                 	<h4>Using of collected  information</h4>
                    <p>If your personally  identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you  may correct, update, delete or deactivate it through your Shopaccino admin store  account.</p>
                 </li>
                 
                 <li><h4>How we use your information provided by you to  us?</h4>
                 	<p>We use personal  information for purposes of administering our business activities, provision of  services, monitoring the use of services, marketing and promotional efforts,  improvement of our content and service offerings, and customization of our  website’s content, layout, services and other lawful purposes. These activities  improve our website and enable us to better tailor it to meet your needs.<br>
                  Furthermore, such  information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis. Personally  identifiable information or business information will not be shared with  parties except as required by law.<br>

                 </li>
                 
                 <li><h4>How we use information collected by cookies? </h4>
                 	<p>As you visit and  browse our website, the website uses cookies to differentiate you from other  users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in  more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our web  server’s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people  visiting our website and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps  us gather feedback to constantly improve our website and better serve our  clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you  and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser  provided to us in your cookies.</p>

                 <li><h4>IP addresses</h4>
                 	<p>Your IP address is a  number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer.

                 </li>
                 
                 <li><h4>Information sharing</h4>

                 </li>
                 
                 <li><h4>Legally Compelled disclosure of information</h4>
                 	<p>We may disclose  information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good  faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal  rights. We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe  that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring  legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to  protect the safety of our users and the Public.</p>
                 </li>
                 
                 <li><h4>Other websites  connected to our website</h4>
