<p><strong id="#1">1. 	Why does shopandwin collect personal information? </strong><br>We collect certain personal information from our visitors to process and fulfill online orders for products or services we offer and to process sweepstakes and contest entries. For example, we need your full name, e-mail and mailing address to fulfill any order you may choose to place at shopandwin and to verify eligibility and enter you in the sweepstakes and contests that are offered at our site.  As detailed below, we may also use the personal data we collect for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes, and to report aggregate information to our marketing partners and others.</p>
<p>To provide our users with a more personalized and relevant web experience, we also collect and use personal data to identify users' specific interests and needs. If given permission, we may notify our users of offers and information we feel may be of interest to them available from shopandwin. If you do not want to receive such offers you may follow the unsubscribe procedures located on the shopandwin.com registration and entry page online registration and entry pages. Our online registration and entry pages contain a clearly identified checked box indicating that by submitting the form you wish to receive email offers from shopandwin. Users may unsubscribe from by clicking to remove the check in the permission notice box before submitting the registration and entry form. You may also login to the "My Account" section of this site to update your privacy and permissions choices.   Please note, if you unsubscribe from our email program we will continue to send you transactional emails providing important information about your transactions on shop and win.</p>
<p><strong id="#2">2. 	How and what information does shopandwin gather or track?</strong><br> Shopandwin collects personal data from our users primarily during the initial registration process on our site. Any information we seek to collect that may be optional will be so indicated.</p>
<p>Shopandwin may by itself or with the services of a third party web analytics company (i.e.  Google analyst, Core Metrics, Omniture) use "cookies" to better understand your users interests and provide you relevant offers and information. Information generated by the Google analytical cookie about your use of shopandwin (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored on servers in the United States.</p>
<p>As described below, through the use of "cookies",  "pixel tags" and registration forms, shopandwin may collect personal data on, among other things, the following information: Demographic (Age, Gender, Income Level), Technical (IP address, domain name, email address, site traffic) and Reference (Name, Land Address, Telephone Number, Password). When you order gifts on our site, we will ask you for your third party contact information including name, mailing address and e-mail address. We will use this information only for the purpose that it was collected (i.e. to fulfill the gift order).</p>
<p>Based upon your interests while visiting shopandwin we may display advertisements or content on other web sites you visit that match the interests indicated during your visits to our site. Similarly, if you visit other sites we may allow them to post advertisements or content to you on shopandwin that matches the interests you indicated during your visit to these third party sites.</p>
<p>shopandwin. may aquire or append data to your file from third party web sites that you have visited including sites where you may have provided information in response to a survey. This information will be used to more accurately direct offers and advertisements to you that match your interests.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We will obtain the customer's consent prior to posting these testimonials.   If you enter information into any blog or chat room that may available at shopandwin    you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in this forum.</p>
<p><strong id="#3">3. What are Cookies?</strong><br> "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer's hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. They record certain information from sites that you visit. The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and users will find them on virtually all  major commercial web sites. Cookies enable us to recognize you and personalize your viewing experience on the shopandwin  site. For example, we use cookies to recognize user access privileges to shopandwin, track site usage and traffic patterns, add advertisements for goods or services that we think may interest you, and estimate our audience size. We also use cookies to store user names and information that are supplied at registration.</p>
<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. It is measured anonymously and only in the aggregate. The information in the cookies lets us trace your "clickstream" activity (i.e., the paths take by visitors to our site as they move from page to page). Cookies do not capture your individual email address or any private information about you.</p>
<p>Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you can decline the placement of a cookie on your hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of your web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie. Customers may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on their browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.</p>
<p>"Pixel tracking", a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other sites, involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of these advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites you may visit and is used to track an individual user's activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our offers with your interests. For example, if you visit our Web site from an advertisement on another site, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that their advertisement brought you to the PCH site. If you visit our website and we link you to another site we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third party web site. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research. Personally identifiable information about you is not collected by the third party advertising company, nor is any tracking information generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other purpose other than to report web site activity to us.</p>
