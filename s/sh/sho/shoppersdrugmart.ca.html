<p>At Shoppers Drug Mart, we respect your privacy and take great care in protecting your Personal Information. This policy demonstrates our commitment to your privacy. Read on to discover how your Personal Information is being protected.</p>
<p style="line-height: 18pt; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A. Scope &amp; Interpretation</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This policy applies to Shoppers Drug Mart Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries, which:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Own stores that operate under the names Shoppers Home Health Care<sup>¬Æ</sup> and Murale<sup>¬Æ</sup>; and</li>
<li>License the operation of retail drug stores and medical clinic pharmacies under the names Shoppers Drug Mart<sup>¬Æ</sup> (Pharmaprix<sup>¬Æ</sup> in Qu√©bec) and Shoppers Simply Pharmacy<sup>¬Æ</sup> (Pharmaprix Simplement Sant√© in Qu√©bec) (owned and operated by Associate-Owners, who are individually responsible for compliance with this policy). &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It also applies to websites operated by Shoppers Drug Mart Inc. and such affiliates and subsidiaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">All references in this policy to ‚ÄúShoppers Drug Mart‚Äù and to ‚Äúus‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, or ‚Äúour‚Äù refer to all or any of the foregoing. This policy does not apply to certain related companies of Shoppers Drug Mart Inc., such as Loblaw Companies Limited, Shoppers Drug Mart Specialty Health Network Inc., MediSystem Technologies Inc. and MediSystem Pharmacy Limited and Personal Information held by them is governed by separate privacy policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In this policy, we explain what Personal Information we collect, and how we use, share and manage it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Please note that when you visit one of our websites, sign up for, participate in or purchase a specific product, service, program, contest, promotion or event available through Shoppers Drug Mart, additional terms and conditions may be provided regarding the collection, use or sharing of Personal Information in connection with that product, service, program, contest, promotion or event. Those terms and conditions will apply together with this policy.&nbsp; For example, the collection, use and sharing of personal information with respect to your membership in the Shoppers Optimum Program¬Æ is subject to the privacy provisions set out in the Terms and Conditions of the Shoppers Optimum Program</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Symbol;">√í</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> and this policy.<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18pt; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0cm; color: #333333;">Personal Information</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">‚ÄúPersonal Information‚Äù as used in this policy means information about an identifiable individual, such as the name and date of birth of that individual, and includes non-personal information that we link to Personal Information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This policy does not apply to the collection, use and sharing of Personal Information by companies with which we have business relationships.&nbsp; However, if we receive from such entities Personal Information or non-personal information that we link to Personal Information, then this privacy policy will apply to the collection, use and sharing of that information.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">What Personal Information is Not</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This policy does not cover non-personal information, which is information that does not identify you. However, as stated above, when we collect non-personal information and link that non-personal information to an identifiable individual, then that information will become Personal Information and become subject to this policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">B. Consent</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Unless permitted or required by law, Shoppers Drug Mart will not collect, use or share Personal Information without first obtaining consent. We will obtain consent when we want to use Personal Information for a new purpose or for a purpose other than those stated at the time of collection, in this policy or in the terms and conditions of a specific product, service, program, contest, promotion or event you signed up for, participated in or purchased.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Consent can be ‚Äúexpress‚Äù through words or by specific acts or ‚Äúimplied‚Äù by the conduct of the individual whose Personal Information is being collected, used or shared. Unless we determine that we require an additional consent for specific products, services, programs, contests, promotions or events, you agree and consent that as a provider of Personal Information, we may collect, use, share or otherwise process your Personal Information in accordance with this policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">You may withdraw your consent for certain purposes. For example, you may choose not to receive:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>information addressed to you personally about products, services, programs, contests, promotions or events offered by Shoppers Drug Mart, affiliated companies or companies with whom we have business relationships; or</li>
<li>invitations addressed to you personally to comment on the products, services, programs, contests, promotions or events that you use or that are available to you.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">However, because of legal or regulatory requirements that we have or contractual obligations you have with us, there are limited circumstances where you may not withdraw your consent to the collection, use or sharing of your Personal Information. If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information or if you withdraw your consent, where such withdrawal is available, we may not be able to offer you the products, services, programs, contests, promotions, events or information that you requested or that could be offered to you. For example, if you withdraw your consent to the sharing by an Associate-Owner‚Äôs pharmacy of your Personal Information with your provincial drug benefit program or your private health insurance provider, the pharmacy may be unable to transmit drug benefit claims, which means you will have to pay for your prescription and seek reimbursement afterwards. Similarly, if the pharmacy is unable to consult with others who provide you with care, they may, using their professional judgment, decline to fill a prescription. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Please also be aware that, even if you have withdrawn your consent to receive marketing communications from us, we may continue to contact you for certain non-marketing purposes necessary for the management of our businesses, as required by law or related to products, services, programs, contests, promotions or events that you had signed up for, agreed to participate in or purchased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">To withdraw or limit your consent, you can contact us as described below in ‚ÄúAnswering Your Privacy Questions‚Äù. If you have a product, service or program, such as a credit card, or are participating in a contest, promotion or event, that is offered by a third party together with Shoppers Drug Mart or under a Shoppers Drug Mart brand, you may also have to provide your consent preferences or withdraw your consent with that third party separately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Please note that it may take some time for all of our records to reflect changes in your preferences. For example, if you request that you not receive personalized marketing communications from Shoppers Drug Mart, your preference may not be captured for a promotion already in progress. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">C. How We Collect Personal Information</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We may also share Personal Information about you with other organizations outside of Shoppers Drug Mart that help Shoppers Drug Mart provide products, services, programs, promotions, contests or events or help us with our business operations. These other organizations may include sub-contractors, third party service providers, third parties that offer products, services, programs, promotions, contests or events under one of our brands, or organizations that help us improve our products, services, programs, promotions, contests or events as well as our business and technology systems, procedures and infrastructure. When Shoppers Drug Mart shares Personal Information with any such party, we limit the use of such Personal Information to those purposes requested by us and we require the party to have appropriate safeguards for the protection of that Personal Information.&nbsp; For example, Personal Information collected from users of Shoppers Drug Mart‚Äôs photo site, shoppersphoto.ca, is automatically transferred to Fujifilm Canada Inc., which operates this photo service on behalf of Shoppers Drug Mart. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0cm; color: #333333;">Healthcare.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;When we provide you with healthcare services, we may share your Personal Information with your healthcare providers (which may also be referred to as your ‚Äúcircle of care‚Äù) and your authorized family members.&nbsp; We may also share it with others but only with your consent or as otherwise permitted by law.&nbsp; For example, we may share prescription information with designated individuals (e.g. parents, caregivers) who have authority to do so.&nbsp; All such sharing is done in a manner consistent with this policy.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We may also share Personal Information as permitted or required by law. For example, if you fill a prescription order in one of the Associate-Owner‚Äôs pharmacies, the pharmacy may share Personal Information with your provincial drug benefit program, private health insurance provider, or other health claim adjudicator as necessary in order to process your claim. The pharmacies may also, as required by law, provide prescription-related information to regulatory authorities, government bodies and/or registries. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Other sharing</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.&nbsp;Canadian law permits or requires the use or sharing of Personal Information without consent in specific circumstances. These circumstances include situations when permitted or required by law or when necessary to protect Shoppers Drug Mart, employees, customers, or others. Should this occur, Shoppers Drug Mart will not share more Personal Information than is required to fulfill that particular purpose.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Sale or transfer of business.&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">From time to time, we may decide to sell or transfer all or part of our business to a related company or to a third party, to merge with another entity, to insure or securitize its assets, or to engage in another form of corporate or financing transaction (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings or as part of a corporate reorganization or stock sale or other change in corporate control). In addition, the manner in which products, services, programs, contests, promotions and events are provided to you, and the organization providing those products, services, programs, contests, promotions or events, may also change. If your Personal Information is required in connection with any such transactions, we will require that the parties involved, including affiliates, advisors or other service providers, agree to protect your Personal Information with policies meeting standards equivalent to those set out in this policy both during and after completion of the transaction.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Similarly, the relationship between Shoppers Drug Mart and a third party that provides a product, service, program, contest, promotion or event under a Shoppers Drug Mart brand may cease. If that third party continues to provide a product, service, program, contest, promotion or event to you, your Personal Information will be subject to that third party‚Äôs privacy policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Other than as stated in this policy or as stated in terms and conditions or as part of a consent in relation to a product, service, program, contest, promotion or event, Shoppers Drug Mart does not sell, trade or share for financial or other benefit any Personal Information with third parties.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 18pt; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0cm; color: #333333;">How We Protect Personal Information</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Shoppers Drug Mart strives to maintain appropriate physical, procedural and technical safeguards with respect to the retail stores, pavilions, kiosks, offices, websites and information storage facilities so as to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of Personal Information. These safeguards also apply to the disposal or destruction of Personal Information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We also seek to ensure that any Personal Information in our custody is as accurate, current and complete as necessary for the purposes for which we use that Personal Information.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18pt; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0cm; color: #333333;">Where We Keep Personal Information</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In general, we store, access and use Personal Information in Canada. Unless there is a legal or regulatory requirement to keep such information in Canada, Personal Information may also be stored, accessed, or used outside of Canada. For instance, when we engage a service provider outside of Canada, Personal Information may be stored, accessed or used in any country where the service provider is located, or from which it provides services, including the United States, the Netherlands and India. Where Personal Information is located outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of that jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">How Long We Keep Personal Information</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We actively retain Personal Information only as long as it is required for our relationship and a certain period of time afterwards to respond to queries or as required by federal and provincial laws. When this period ends, Personal Information is scheduled for destruction according to our record retention policies. Depending on the nature of the Personal Information and the purpose for which it was collected, this schedule may vary.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">G. Access And Dispute Resolution</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Shoppers Drug Mart provides a right of access and review of your Personal Information in accordance with applicable laws, and will endeavour to provide the Personal Information in question within a reasonable time. You will be asked for identification so that we may verify your identity before providing you with your Personal Information. If you require the documents in an alternative format, we will make reasonable efforts to provide you with your Personal Information in that format. If there will be charges for us to retrieve or provide you with specific information that you have requested, we will advise you of the charges that you would be responsible for and obtain your authorization before proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Our policy is to respond to access requests as required by applicable laws. Shoppers Drug Mart may decline access to Personal Information in certain circumstances. These include where the information requested would reveal confidential information or Personal Information about someone else, or if legal or regulatory requirements prohibit providing access or permit not providing access to such information. To access your personal health information, a written request should be sent to the Associate-Owner of the pharmacy where your prescription records and patient file are maintained.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">If you are concerned about how we treat your Personal Information, please contact the appropriate Privacy Officer using the contact information set out below in ‚ÄúAnswering Your Privacy Questions‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">If the Privacy Officer is unable to address your concern to your satisfaction, arbitration may be an option recommended to you to settle the dispute. Arbitration is a form of dispute resolution. If the parties decide to pursue arbitration, then the parties would refer the dispute to an arbitrator who would take into account the evidence of each of the parties and render a decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">If you remain unsatisfied, you may bring the matter to the attention of the appropriate Privacy Commissioner. Some of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada; other activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the Privacy Commissioner of your province of residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">H. Answering Your Privacy Questions</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Shoppers Drug Mart encourages you to review this policy periodically. If you have any questions about how we treat your Personal Information or wish to know what information we have in our files about you, ask a question about the information in your file or request a change to the information in your file, please contact the appropriate Privacy Officer listed below.</span></p>
