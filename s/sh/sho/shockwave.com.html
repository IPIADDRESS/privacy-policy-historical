<h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>

<p>
If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. <b>Alternatively</b>, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as "unsubscribe") or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may therefore instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. 
</p>

<p>
Atom Entertainment qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. 
</p>

<p>
If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at privacy-admin (at) atom.com, or you may contact us via regular mail at:

</p>

<p>
To all other users of this Site, if you have other questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact our Privacy Administrator at privacy-admin (at) atom.com. This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site, even if your use of or participation in any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. 
</p>

<p>
<b>1. Collection and Use of Personal Information:</b> When we use the term "Personal Information" we mean information such as your first/middle initial or name and last name, street address, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, instant-messenger nickname, blog or other personal website URL, date of birth, e-mail address and any other information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you. Personal Information also includes information such as lists of your friends' real names and their email addresses, instant-messenger nicknames or other personal identifiable information that you may add to such friend lists and your transactions or relationship with us, if you have been a user of the Site. 
</p>

<p>
We collect Personal Information about you when you visit the Site and input information, whether you are registering to use any features or functions of the Site, participating in Promotions (as defined in the <a href="/about/terms.jsp">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, or in the course of any other exchanges of information, transactions and activities. We may use the information we obtain from you, including Personal Information, to tailor your experience of the Site, to display content we think may be of interest to you, or to let us customize what you see when you visit or use the Site according to your preferences.
</p>

<p>
<b>a. Collection of Personal Information During Registration.</b> To the extent we offer user registration for the Site, to register as a member of the Site, you are required to select a user name and password (together, your "User ID"), and may be required to also provide other Personal Information, such as your email address, first and last name, gender, date of birth, country and zip code. Additional Personal Information may be requested during the registration process (but not required), such as favorite games, gender, ethnic information, and annual income. We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Personal Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID. Among other things, these kinds of information help us securely identify you as a registered or permitted user of the Site and our features and functions. You will not be able to change your date of birth without sufficient verification.
</p>

<p>
In some instances, such as when requesting an alternative free method to play games that provide instant win prizes and sweepstakes that are only available to paid subscribers, we will create a temporary subscription account and we will select your user name and password. 
</p>

<p>
Many user member benefits are not free, and you may be required to pay for subscriptions or games by entering your credit card information and billing address. As a registered user of the Site, from time to time, we may also provide you with certain options to subscribe to a selection of free email newsletters and other periodic information. You may select such options by opting-in at the time of registration or by responding to an offer or invitation at a later date. You will also have the right to opt-out (unsubscribe) or change your preferences at any time by logging in with your User ID and changing the settings in your account. You may also opt-out to particular email communications by responding to that email and using the "unsubscribe" or opt-out procedure included in that communication. 
</p>

<p>
If you are a registered user, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site in connection with your registration. You also agree to this Privacy Policy and the <a href="/about/terms.jsp">Terms of Use Agreement</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>b. Collection of Personal Information During Registration or In Connection with Certain Features and Functions.</b> During registration (and possibly at certain other times to enable your use of other features or functions or for security purposes), you will be required to provide us with certain information about you in order for us to allow you to use the features and functions that we may offer on the Site, such as Promotions, instant messaging, Software downloads, chat rooms, message boards, electronic mail services, messaging services, auctions, Communities, Viral Features, registration and member profile pages. 
</p>

<p>
<b>c. Collection of Personal Information in Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.</b> To the extent we offer user registration on the Site, registration as a member of the Site is not always sufficient to enter Promotions such as contests and sweepstakes. Therefore, we may require a separate registration process which will require the submission of all or some of the following: your first and last name, street address, city, state and zip code, email address, telephone number and date of birth. Additional Personal Information may be requested depending on the specific Promotion, but submission of such information may be optional. The Promotion's entry page and/or Rules will provide the specific requirements. You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to special Promotions or offers from our Advertisers in connection with many of these types of Promotions.
</p>

<p>
<b>d. Use of Personal Information in Connection with Promotions and Offers; Opt-out Procedures.</b> We, or our Affiliates, may contact the Site's registered users or other users that have registered for or participated in various Site events, Promotions, or transactions, or we may send offers for the purchase of goods and/or services that may be of interest to users. 
</p>

<p>
You may "opt out" of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails or text messages from us at any time by going to the by going to the Site's home page, clicking "My Shockwave" link, clicking the "Account Management" link, to (1) un-register your account, or (2) change or edit your preferences. You may also use the opt-out mechanism that is contained in an email or text message. However, we, or our Affiliates, may continue to contact you via email for administrative, transactional, or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, any services, features or functions you have enrolled in or registered to use, any Promotions you have participated in or have entered, subscriptions, goods and/or services or Products you have ordered, or other transactions you have undertaken with the Site. 
</p>

<p>
In the event that we, or our Affiliates, unknowingly sends an email or text message to an Ineligible Child (as defined in Section 9) who has registered with the Site or its features in violation of the Site's <a href="/about/terms.jsp">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, the Ineligible Child or the child's parent or legal guardian always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message, or to request termination of the Ineligible Child's registration and status as a registered user with the Site. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state). Please see the "Review, Update, or Delete Your Personal Information" Section below for details. 
</p>

<p>
<b>e. Sharing of Aggregate Information with Third Parties.</b> Some of the aggregate user data we collect may be shared with Advertisers, our Affiliates, and other business partners of the Site, its Parent Companies, and/or its Affiliates, but we do not give any Personal Information to them as part of the relationship except as described in this Privacy Policy. Use of their tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.
</p>

<p>
<b>f. Use of Communities.</b> If you use any of the Communities features and functions made available on or through the Site, please remember that any information disclosed in these venues may be automatically made public.

<p>
<b>2. Wireless Marketing Sites and Promotional Opportunities:</b> Shockwave may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from Shockwave either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by Affiliates for Shockwave. The Personal Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Optional information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of video games, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other information and, depending on the information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the <a href="/about/terms.jsp">Terms of Use Agreement</a>.
</p>

<p>
We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.
</p>

<p>
Users that register for Shockwave's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from Shockwave. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. <b>Under no circumstances will Shockwave, Atom Entertainment, its Parent Companies, or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>a. Registration.</b> To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided Shockwave's wireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single opt-in" or the "double-opt-in" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of Shockwave depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.
</p>

<p>
<b>1) Single Opt-in Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Shockwave will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Atom Entertainment to send text messages to him or her. Shockwave will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "Thank you" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Shockawve or by sending a text message to Atom Entertainment that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT".
</p>

<p>
<b>2) Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to the Site's web site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to Shockwave's sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by Shockwave) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration page. The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and <a href="/about/terms.jsp">Terms of Use Agreement</a> before the online registration process is completed. Shockwave will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Shockwave to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of Shockwave's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that Shockwave may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received Shockwave continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.
</p>

<p>
<b>3) Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. Shockwave will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Shockwave to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of Shockwave's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that Shockwave may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while Atom Entertainment continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service. 
</p>

<p>
<b>b. Termination of Wireless Messages or Content by User.</b> Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive wireless messages or content from Shockwave by the following procedure: 
</p>

<p>
A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by Shockwave at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". Shockwave will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with Shockwave. If the user un-subscribes from one or all of Shockwave's service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.
</p>

<p>
<b>c. Termination of Wireless Sites by Shockwave.</b> A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that Shockwave may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. Shockwave may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.
</p>

<p>
<b>d. Use of Information.</b> Shockwave will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Personal Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will not share such Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure. We will share such Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with the Parent Companies and Affiliates. 
</p>

<p>
<b>3. Accuracy and Confidentiality:</b> It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, and to keep such information up to date. We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or Personal Information or you fail to update such information or Personal Information. 
</p>

<p>
You are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your User ID, if applicable, and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities and losses we incur or may suffer as a result of your failure to do so. You, and not us, are solely responsible and liable for your activity, behavior, use and conduct on the Site and for any use of the Site or any other activity or conduct in connection with the Site by any others who use your User ID, unless and until you notify us that your User ID may have been compromised, misappropriated or improperly taken or used by another party. 
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind that when you submit information to us, it does not guarantee that we will permit you to use any or all of the features or functions of the Site.
</p>

    <li>If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations; or</li>
    <li>In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>7. Security &amp; Protection of Personal Information:</b> We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites or services, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>8. Phishing:</b> Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. "Phishers" use "spoofed" e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator at privacy-admin(at)atom.com, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.
</p>

<p>
<b>9. Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information:</b> Generally, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information or Confidential Personal Information collected by the Site. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. Deletion or attempted deletion of certain Personal Information, such as your user name, may not be permitted and/or may result in suspension of your account or termination of any registration you may have made. To review, update or delete your Personal Information or Confidential Personal Information collected by the Site, please click "MY ACCOUNT" on the homepage to sign in to your Site account with your User ID. Then, click on " ACCOUNT INFO" to change, update, or delete your Personal Information. 
</p>

<p>
If you wish to review Personal Information collected for Promotions such as contests and sweepstakes, you will need to contact the Site's Privacy Administrator via email with a request at privacy-admin(at)atom.com and be prepared to provide verification of your identity. Personal Information collected for certain entries are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old. 
</p>

<p>
Children under the age of 13, or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of this Site ("Ineligible Child"), that are unknowingly registered on the Site are in violation of the <a href="/about/terms.jsp">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Parents (including legal guardians) of children or Ineligible Children that registered on the Site in violation of the <a href="/about/terms.jsp">Terms of Use Agreement</a> who wish to terminate their Ineligible Child's membership must use their Ineligible Child's User ID to gain direct access to the account, and select "CANCEL ACCOUNT" or alternatively, you can send us an email to the Site's Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Child's User ID and their email address and request to terminate your Ineligible Child's account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person without the user's User ID (please see above for how to change your preferences or the information associated with your account). If a parent does not have his or her Ineligible Child's User ID, the parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the Ineligible Child's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the Ineligible Child's date of birth. The parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent of the Ineligible Child. Atom Entertainment will send a confirming email to the parent via the email address provided to verify that the parent wishes to terminate his or her Ineligible Child's account and registration. The parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. Atom Entertainment will then terminate the Ineligible Child's account but will notify the Ineligible Child of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request. 
</p>

<p>
We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user's account or any services, features or functions. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries. 
</p>

<p>
<b>10. Questions:</b> If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or if you do not understand any information about how we collect, maintain, use or share your Personal Information, you may contact us directly by sending an email to privacy-admin(at)atom.com.
</p>

<p>
<b>11. Sole Statement:</b> This document is the sole statement of the Site's Privacy Policy and no summary, restatement or other version thereof, or other privacy statement or policy, in any form, including, without limitation, machine-generated, is valid.
