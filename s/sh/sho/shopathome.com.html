					<h3>Magazines &amp; Catalogs Privacy Commitment</h3>
					<p>We at ShopAtHome.com are committed to protecting your privacy. We take your

						raised the bar for privacy practices by ensuring DMA members adhere to certain 
						privacy practices, and by challenging all non-DMA industry members to meet this 
						high standard as well. If you would like to learn more about the DMA privacy 
						policy, please visit <a href="http://www.the-dma.org" target="top">www.the-dma.org</a>

						standard. Our contract with you promises to maintain your privacy and explains,

					<h3>Our Privacy Commitments</h3>
					<a name="1"></a>
					<h3>Commitment 1:</h3>
					<p><strong>What information we collect, how it's collected and how it's used.</strong>
						<br>
						When placing an order or becoming a member of ShopAtHome.com, you are asked to 
						enter the following important information:
					</p>
					<p>
						First &amp; Last Name<br>
						Billing Address<br>
						Mailing Address<br>
						E-mail Address<br>
						Credit Card Information (only if needed to process your order)
					</p>
					<p>
						We require this information in order to e-mail you an order confirmation and to 
						completely process your request.
					</p>
					<p>
						When signing up for membership, we ask that you provide us the following 
						information so that we can personalize your shopping experience and better 
						provide you with information of special interest to you:
					</p>
					<p>
						First &amp; Last Name<br>
						E-mail Address<br>
						How You Like to Receive E-mail<br>
						Gender<br>
						Age<br>
						Interest Categories<br>
						Mailing Address (if not already on file from previous orders)
					</p>
					<p>
						ShopAtHome.com uses cookie technology to maintain information from your orders 
						and membership in order to deliver information to you that is specific to your 
						interests and to alleviate having to re-enter duplicate information. If your 
						browser does not support cookies, or if your cookies are turned off, you will 
						be asked to supply your information each time you place an order with 
						ShopAtHome.com.
					</p>
					<a name="2"></a>
					<h3>Commitment 2:</h3>
					<p><strong>Ensuring your personal information is securely stored.</strong>
						<br>
						Our site has extensive security measures in place to protect from the loss, 
						misuse or alteration of the information within our control. We give you the 
						option to place your order using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption. In the 
						event that your choose not to use the SSL option or your system does not 
						support SSL, you can place your order in a plain text format on a non-secure 
						platform.
					</p>
					<p>
						For your financial protection, once your order is processed, we DO NOT MAINTAIN 
						YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION in any form of shopping cart or basket that is 
						accessible via the Internet. You will be asked for this information each time 
						you order an item that requires a credit card.</p>
					<a name="3"></a>
					<h3>Commitment 3:</h3>
					<p><strong>If you do not place an order or register with ShopAtHome.com, we do not 
							collect any personal information about you.</strong>
						<br>
						Our Web server automatically recognizes the home server of visitors (the IP - 
						Internet Protocol- address) but not e-mail addresses. Therefore, individually 
						identifiable e-mail addresses are not captured or stored for future use, unless 
						you provide them by ordering a product or signing up as a member of 
						ShopAtHome.com. ShopAtHome.com uses your IP address to understand general 
						information on site traffic trends such as most frequently visited pages or 
						categories. This information is captured on an aggregate basis and is not 
						specific to individual users. This aggregate information enables ShopAtHome.com 
						to continually improve our Web site content and navigation.
					</p>
					<p>
						ShopAtHome.com also has an Affiliate Program by which sites can direct traffic 
						to ShopAtHome.com in exchange for commission. To ensure proper payment is made 
						to all Affiliates, ShopAtHome.com tracks the volume of traffic and orders 
						generated from these Affiliate sites.</p>
					<a name="4"></a>
					<h3>Commitment 4:</h3>
					<p><strong>With whom does ShopAtHome.com share your information?</strong><br>
						When you request a catalog or order a product, we forward your contact 
						information to catalog or magazine company so that they can promptly fulfill 
						your request. By ordering a catalog or magazine, you are opting-in to receive 
						direct mail and e-mail from the specific publisher. The catalog/magazine 
						companies maintain individual privacy policies. By visiting their Web sites, 
						you can fully understand the individual privacy policies of each of the client 
						companies from which you have requested information, and may request to be 
						opted-out from their future communications.
					</p>
					<p>
						From time to time, ShopAtHome.com may, with your permission, send you 
						information related to your interest areas and from other pre-screened 
						companies that have products in your interest areas. We ask your permission to 
						send this information and to share your name in the following ways:
					</p>
					<p>
						ShopAtHome.com announces our latest and greatest FREE offers via e-mail -- 
						often before they become available on our site. Some offers are exclusive to 
						our e-mails, and are not even shown on our site.
					</p>
					<a name="5"></a>
					<h3>Commitment 5:</h3>
					<p><strong>You can change the information we have on file for you at any time.</strong>
						<br>
						If you are one of our ShopAtHome.com members and would like to view and/or 
						change any of the information you have selected, simply visit the <a href="Account.aspx">
							Edit My Preferences</a> page and make the desired updates.</p>
					<a name="6"></a>
					<h3>Commitment 6:</h3>
					<p><strong>You can choose to be removed - or to "opt-out" at any time.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						If you wish to stop receiving special offers from ShopAtHome.com, simply <a href="http://www.shopathome.com/optout.asp">
							click here</a>. Please allow up to 7 business days to be completely 
						opted-out from ShopAtHome.com broadcasts. You may receive serveral additional

						Phone: 303-843-0302/Fax: 303-843-0377<br>

					<p><a name="privacy1"></a><strong>What Information We Collect and Why</strong><br>
						Our goal at ShopAtHome.com is to maximize the "Cash Back" rewards for our 
						members and to provide them with as many benefits as possible. The primary way 
						we do this is by utilizing the power of our consumer membership base to 
						negotiate significant sales commissions from both well-known national retailers 
						as well as specialty boutiques (our "Affiliate Merchants"). We then pass on as 
						much of this commission to you, as a ShopAtHome.com member, in the form of real 
						cash. &nbsp; Consequently, when you first register with ShopAtHome.com, we ask 
						you to provide your name, date of birth, street address, and E-mail address to 
						determine your eligibility to be a member and to process your "Cash Back" 
						rewards. We also ask for additional optional information on your interests, 
						gender, and occupation. Based on this information, we can better determine what 
						types of merchants and specials to pursue so that you will get the most out of 
						your membership in ShopAtHome.com. However, you are under no obligation to 
						provide us with this information-it is completely optional.
						&nbsp;&nbsp;ShopAtHome.com may also collect certain information online deriving from your navigation of ShopAtHome.com 
						and our Affiliate Merchants.&nbsp;&nbsp;We collect this information to ensure that you receive your cash back rewards 
						and to better understand what type of merchants and specials to pursue.
						<br>We do collect information regarding other software that might be resident on your computer that 
						may impact the correct functioning of the SOFTWARE. 
						&nbsp;&nbsp;ShopAtHome.com uses cookie technology to 
						understand general information on site traffic trends such as most frequently 
						visited pages or Affiliate Merchants. This information is captured on an 
						aggregate basis, is not specific to individual users, and enables 
						ShopAtHome.com to continually improve our Web site content and navigation. 
						&nbsp; The cookies also enable our Affiliate Merchants to recognize you as a 
						ShopAtHome.com member so that they can accurately process Qualified Purchases. 
						Since we need to be able to identify each individual user for accurate posting 
						of ShopAtHomeSelect rebates and for the best matching of your interests with 
						what our site has to offer, the information in cookies may also be captured on 
						an individual basis. (Please refer to our Membership Agreement for a full 
						definition of a "Qualified Purchase.").
					</p>
					<p><a name="privacy2"></a><strong>How We Ensure the Security of Your Information</strong><br>
						ShopAtHome.com has extensive security measures in place to protect the 
						information within our control from loss, misuse or alteration. We have all 
						appropriate industry standard procedures in place to safeguard the 
						confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewall and Secure 
						Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. However, no data transmitted over the Internet 
						can be 100% secure. Consequently, while ShopAtHome.com makes every effort to 
						protect your personal information, any information that you provide to 
						ShopAtHome.com or its Affiliate Merchants is transmitted at your own risk.
					</p>
					<p><a name="privacy3"></a><strong>With Whom We Share Your Information </strong>
						<br>
						Our primary use of your personal information is to process your Cash Back 
						reward checks and to maintain your Member account. ShopAtHome.com may also 
						store and use your personal information for our own internal mailing and 
						database purposes. &nbsp; The composite tracking information generated by 
						cookies, as outlined above, may be shared with third parties for the purpose of 
						documenting site activity and other trends. &nbsp; In the course of our 
						day-to-day business, we employ outside companies and individuals to perform 
						functions for us, such as removing duplicate information from customer lists or 
						providing database analysis. These vendors have access to the personal 
						information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other 
						purposes. &nbsp; We share member information only with ShopAtHome.com's parent 
						company, Belcaro Group, Inc. All E-mails distributed by Belcaro Group, 
						ShopAtHome.com, or ShopAtHome.com have simple opt-out mechanisms should you 
						decide you do not want to receive these offers from us.
					</p>
					<p><a name="privacy4"></a><strong>Your privacy as related to our Affiliate Merchants</strong><br>
						In order to grant your cash back rebate, our Affiliate Merchants pass back to 
						us the amount of your order as well as your unique customer id. With these two 
						pieces of information, we are able to make sure the right rebate goes to the 
						right person. &nbsp; ShopAtHome.com contains links to our Affiliate Merchants. 
						Each of these merchants maintains its own privacy statement and we encourage 
						you to read these individual policies. We cannot either enforce or monitor the 
						Privacy Policies of Affiliate Merchants. This Privacy Commitment applies solely 
						to information collected by ShopAtHome.com, on our site. &nbsp; ShopAtHome.com 
						does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third 
						party Web sites including all framed sites. Moreover, ShopAtHome.com disclaims 
						all responsibility for the subsequent use of an E-mail address or any other 
						personally identifiable information you have provided to an Affiliate Merchant.
					</p>
					<p><a name="privacy5"></a><strong>How you can change, correct and update your 
							information</strong><br>
						As a ShopAtHome.com member, you can change the information we have on file for 
						you at any time, including your interest areas and what types of information 
						you receive, simply by visiting the Edit My Preferences page and making your 
						desired changes. &nbsp; Upon enrollment, ShopAtHome.com members are opted-in to 
						receive ShopAtHome.com and ShopAtHome.com newsletters and special E-mail 
						promotions. On every one of these E-mails you are given the choice to 
						unsubscribe from the mailing or you may opt out <a id="lnkCustomerCare" href="http://discounts.shopathome.com/CustomerCare.asp">here</a>. 
						Please allow up to 7 business days to process your E-mail request or account 
						changes.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br>
						As our company changes and grows, we might sell or buy companies, subsidiaries, 
						or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the 
						transferred business assets. Also, in the event that ShopAtHome.com or 
						substantially all of its assets are acquired, your member information may be 
						one of the transferred assets. &nbsp; By enrolling in the ShopAtHome.com 
						program, you agree that you have read, understand and agree with our Privacy 
						Commitment, and the Membership Agreement, in its entirety, and consent to be 
						bound by all said Terms and Conditions. You further acknowledge 
						ShopAtHome.com's right to change this policy, without prior notification, and 
						our commitment to post any such changes on this page so that you are fully 
						informed. We encourage our members to check back from time to time, as your 
						continued enrollment in the ShopAtHome.com program shall be deemed to be your 
						acceptance of the modified terms.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp; If Belcaro Group's best business efforts do not address your privacy 
						complaint within a reasonable timeframe, you may contact the Direct Marketing 
						Association's dispute resolution center at its Web site <a href="http://www.the-dma.org/safeharbor/consumers.shtml" target="_blank">
