					<h2 align="center">ShopAtHome.com's Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>ShopAtHome.com's Privacy Policy is divided into two sections, Cash Back and 
						Catalogs, so it can clearly address the issues relevant to each major component 
						of our ShopAtHome.com Shopping Portal</p>
					<h2>Cash Back Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>We at <strong>ShopAtHome.com</strong> take your right to privacy seriously. We 
						developed this Privacy Policy, in conjunction with our
						<a id="hlTermsAndConditions" href="TermsAndConditions.aspx">Membership Agreement</a>, 
						to ensure that:
						</p><ul>
							<li>
							You fully understand your rights as a ShopAtHome.com member and Toolbar user
							</li><li>
							You recognize ShopAtHome.com's responsibilities to you, and
							</li><li>
								You recognize our commitment to upholding your privacy.</li>
						</ul>

					<p></p>
					<p><a name="privacy1"></a><strong>What Information We Collect and Why</strong><br>
						At ShopAtHome.com we aim to provide our members with the most current shopping 
						information, keep them informed of the best deals on relevant products, and 
						maximize their "Cash Back" rewards. The primary way we accomplish these goals 
						is by utilizing the power of our consumer membership base to gain access to 
						special deals and promotions, and to negotiate sales commissions from both 
						well-known national retailers as well as specialty boutiques (our "Affiliate 
						Stores"). We then share this commission with you, as a ShopAtHome.com member, 
						in the form of real cash. &nbsp; Consequently, when you first register with 
						ShopAtHome.com, we ask you to provide your name, email address and password so 
						we can notify you of your Cash Back rewards. ShopAtHome.com may also collect 
						certain information online deriving from your navigation of ShopAtHome.com and 
						our Affiliate Stores. We collect this information to ensure that you receive 
						your cash back rewards and to better understand what type of stores and 
						specials to pursue. When you make a credit card purchase on one of our 
						Affiliate Stores, our system is notified that a credit card transaction has 
						taken place. This notification occurs to help ensure that your Cash Back 
						rewards are properly credited to your account. No individual credit card 
						information is received by our Site.
						<br>
						<br>
						Members who have elected to download our Toolbar also receive shopping alerts 
						based on their browser activity. These alerts can be for special deals and/or 
						stores that are pertinent to our members' shopping needs. A history of links to 
						our Stores may be kept in order to better personalize our members' shopping 
						alerts.
						<br>
						<br>
						ShopAtHome.com uses cookie technology to understand general information on site 
						traffic trends such as most frequently visited pages or Affiliate Stores. This 
						information is captured on an aggregate basis, is not specific to individual 
						users, and enables us to continually improve our Web site content and 
						navigation. We also use cookie technology for login and navigation between the 
						various components of our Site.
						<br>
						<br>
						We sometimes make available to users on our Site specific offers from third 
						party companies. Please note that any personal information that you provide on 
						our Site to take advantage of such third party offers may also be retained by 
						ShopAtHome.
						<br>
						<br>
						This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not 
						responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We 
						encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the 
						privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable 
						information.
					</p>
					<p><a name="privacy2"></a><strong>How We Ensure the Security of Your Information</strong><br>
						ShopAtHome.com has security measures in place to protect the information within 
						our control from loss, misuse or alteration. We have appropriate industry 
						standard procedures in place to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal 
						information, such as firewall and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. 
						However, no data transmitted over the Internet can be 100% secure. 
						Consequently, while ShopAtHome.com makes every effort to protect your personal 
						information, any information that you provide to ShopAtHome.com or its 
						Affiliate Stores is transmitted at your own risk.</p>
					<p><a name="privacy3"></a><strong>With Whom We Share Your Information </strong>
						<br>
						Our primary use of your personal information is to process your Cash Back 
						reward checks and to maintain your Member account. Your browser activity is 
						used to trigger personalized shopping alerts if you have elected to use our 
						shopping Toolbar. ShopAtHome.com may also store and use your personal 
						information for our own internal mailing and database purposes. The composite 
						tracking information generated by cookies, as outlined above, may be shared 
						with third parties for the purpose of documenting site activity and other 
						trends. In the course of our day-to-day business, we may employ outside 
						companies and individuals to perform functions for us, such as removing 
						duplicate information from customer lists or providing database analysis. These 
						vendors have access to the personal information needed to perform their 
						functions, but may not use it for other purposes. All emails distributed by 
						Belcaro Group, Inc. d/b/a ShopAtHome, or ShopAtHome.com have simple opt-out 
						mechanisms should you decide you do not want to receive these offers from us.</p>
					<p><a name="privacy4"></a><strong>Your privacy as related to our Affiliate Stores</strong><br>
						In order to grant your cash back rebate, our Affiliate Stores pass back to us 
						the amount of your order as well as your unique customer ID. With these two 
						pieces of information, we are able to make sure the right rebate goes to the 
						right person. &nbsp; ShopAtHome.com's site contains links to our Affiliate 
						Stores. Each of these stores maintains its own privacy statement and we 
						encourage you to read these individual policies. We can neither enforce nor 
						monitor the Privacy Policies of Affiliate Stores. This Privacy Policy applies 
						solely to information collected by ShopAtHome.com, on our site. &nbsp; 
						ShopAtHome.com does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of 
						third party Web sites including all framed sites. Moreover, ShopAtHome.com 
						disclaims all responsibility for the subsequent use of an email address or any 
						other personally identifiable information you have provided to an Affiliate 
						Store.</p>
					<p><a name="privacy5"></a><strong>How you can change, correct and update your 
							information</strong><br>
						As a ShopAtHome.com member, you can change the information we have on file for 
						you at any time, simply by clicking on the "My Account"
						link at the top of the page if you are logged in; or clicking on the
						<a id="lnkMyPrefs" href="https://secure.shopathome.com//discounts/CustomerPreferences.aspx?PreferenceTab=1">My Preferences</a>
						on the left side of the Cash Back homepage; and making your desired changes. 
						Upon enrollment, ShopAtHome.com members are opted-in to receive ShopAtHome.com 
						Cash Back newsletters and special email promotions, as well as ShopAtHome.com 
						Catalogs newsletters and special email promotions. ShopAtHome.com announces its 
						latest deals and special offers in these emails, sometimes before they are 
						posted on our site. On every one of these emails you are given the choice to 
						unsubscribe from the mailing or you may opt out from Cash Back emails or 
						from Catalogs emails.  You may also login and change your email preferences
						<a id="lnkMyPrefs2" href="https://secure.shopathome.com//discounts/CustomerPreferences.aspx?PreferenceTab=1">here</a>. For your security, you will
						be prompted to login before updating any account information.  Please allow 
						up to 7 business days to process your email request or account changes. You may 
						receive several additional emails from us while we are processing your 
						unsubscribe request.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br>
						As our company changes and grows, we might sell or buy companies, subsidiaries, 
						or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the 
						transferred business assets. Also, in the event that ShopAtHome.com or 
						substantially all of its assets are acquired, your member information may be 
						one of the transferred assets. &nbsp; By enrolling in the ShopAtHome.com 
						program, you agree that you have read, understand and agree with our Privacy 
						Policy, and the <a href="TermsAndConditions.aspx">Membership Agreement</a>, in 
						its entirety, and consent to be bound by all said Terms and Conditions. You 
						further acknowledge ShopAtHome.com's right to change this policy, without prior 
						notification, and our commitment to post any such changes on this page so that 
						you are fully informed. We encourage our members to check back from time to 
						time, as your continued enrollment in the ShopAtHome.com program shall be 
						deemed to be your acceptance of the modified terms.
