        	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

		    <p> 
			    Your privacy is critically important to us. At <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> we have a few fundamental principles:
		    </p> 
		    <ul> 
			    <li> 
				    We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender 

				    or income level for no apparent reason.)

			    </li>

			    <li>

				    We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

			    </li>

			    <li>

				    We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

			    </li>

			    <li>

				    In our social networking and mobile application products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by 
				    search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.    
			    </li> 
		    </ul> 
		    <p> 
			    Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:
		    </p>

		    <p>

			    <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> (“ShoutEm”) operates several websites including 
			    <a href="https://www.shoutem.com" target="_blank">shoutem.com</a> (collectively, the “Websites”), as well as a number of mobile applications on behalf of our customers (collectively, the “Applications”). 
			    It is <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>'s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information 
			    we may collect while operating our Websites and Applications.
		    </p> 
    		
		    <h3> 
			    Website Visitors and Application Users
		    </h3> 
		    <p> 
			    <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically 
			    make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>' 
			    purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>' visitors use its Websites and Applications. From time 
			    to time, <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage 
			    of its Websites or Applications.
		    </p> 
		    <p> 
			    <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> does not use 
			    such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it 
			    uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
		    </p> 
    		
		    <h3> 
			    Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
		    </h3> 
		    <p> 
		        Certain visitors to <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>'s Websites and users of <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>’s Applications 
		        choose to interact with <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> in ways that require <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> to gather 
			    personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. 
			    For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a social network at <a href="https://www.shoutem.com" target="_blank">shoutem.com</a> to provide a 
			    username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> – are asked to provide additional information, including as 
			    necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> collects such information 
			    only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>. <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> does not 
			    disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying 
			    information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Website-related and Application-related activities.
		    </p> 
    		
		    <h3> 
			    Aggregated Statistics
		    </h3> 
		    <p> 
			    <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its Websites and users of its Applications. For instance, <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> may monitor the most popular 
			    social networks on the <a href="https://www.shoutem.com" target="_blank">shoutem.com</a> site. <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> may display this information publicly 
			    or provide it to others. However, <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
		    </p> 
    		
		    <h3> 
			    Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
		    </h3> 
		    <p> 
			    <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors 
			    and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>'s behalf or to provide services 
			    available at <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>'s Websites and Applications, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated 
			    organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>'s Websites and Applications, you consent to the transfer of such information to 
			    them. <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its 
			    employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> discloses potentially personally-identifying and 
			    personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably 
			    necessary to protect the property or rights of <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> 
			    Websites or Applications and have supplied your email address, <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit 
			    your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs 
			    to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a 
			    support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request 
			    or to help us support other users. <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, 
			    alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
		    </p> 
    		
		    <h3> 
			    Cookies
		    </h3> 
		    <p> 
			    A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each 
			    time the visitor returns. <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> uses cookies to help <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> identify and track visitors, their usage of the <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> Websites, and 
			    their website access preferences. <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to 
			    refuse cookies before using <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>'s Websites, with the drawback that certain features of <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>'s Websites may not function properly 
			    without the aid of cookies.
		    </p> 
    		
		    <h3> 
			    Ads
		    </h3> 
		    <p> 
			    Ads appearing on any of our Websites or Applications may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server 
			    to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. 
			    This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. 
			    This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
		    </p> 
    		
		    <h3> 
			    Privacy Policy Changes
		    </h3> 
		    <p> 
			    Although most changes are likely to be minor, <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a>' sole discretion. 
			    <a href="https://www.shoutem.com/contact">ShoutEm, Inc.</a> encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a
