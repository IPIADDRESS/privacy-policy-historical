    <strong>Summary of key principles</strong>

<p>
    We typically use this information for fraud prevention purposes and to

    analytics partners who may combine it with other information you’ve

    <strong>
        I. What information do we collect about you and where do we collect it

    collect certain information from you when you access our Sites including

    your order but no other personal data.

<p>
    </p></li><li> to improve our Sites and Services and to carry out your requests and

    our legitimate interests or consent where we ask it of you. You may object
    to processing by us for this reason at any time in accordance with section
    VII below.
</p>
<p>
    We may disclose your information to:
</p>
<ul type="disc">

    believe that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfil a government request,
    including for national security or law enforcement reasons; (b) conform
    with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend
    our legal rights or property, our Sites, or other users; or (d) in an
    emergency to protect the health and safety of our Sites’ users or the
    general public.
<p></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
    <strong>
        III. Transferring your information outside the European Economic Area
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Some of the information we collect about you is transferred to and stored
    on our servers in the United States of America. When personal data is
    transferred from within the EEA to any of our affiliates outside the EEA we
    use the EU model clauses to ensure that the transfer is subject to adequate
    safeguards in accordance with our legal obligations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>IV. How long we store your information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The information we collect about you when you access our Sites (including
    referring URL, page visits, browser and/or device type, time and date) and
    the information provided by our third-party merchants is pseudonymized
    immediately prior to storing it, and we delete data we store after 10
    years. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    We store the information you provide to us when you contact us by email for
    a period of up to 5 years.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>V. Cookies and similar technologies</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We automatically receive and store certain types of information whenever
    you use our Sites by using "cookies" and analogous technology. "Cookies"
    are small files that we place on your computer or your Web browser memory
    to enable our systems to recognise your browser.
</p>
<p>
    We work with third parties, including advertising companies and website
    analysis firms, who use cookies to collect information about you when you
    visit our Sites and third-party sites about your surfing activities. This
    information, collected through cookies, is typically used by our selected
    third-party advertising networks to: (a) serve you with advertisements
    while on our Sites and third-party sites tailored to meet your preferences
    and likely interests; or (b) conduct market research and website analysis.
If you do not wish to participate in this activity, please    <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">click here</a>
    for options to opt-out of advertising. You can also object to any profiling
    that takes place in relation to being served with tailored advertisements
    in accordance with section VII below.
</p>
<p>
    A couple of important notes about this opt-out guide: (1) it includes all
    the advertising networks that Connexity works with, but also many that
    Connexity does not work with; and (2) it relies on cookies to ensure that a
    given advertising network does not collect information about you (“Opt-out
Cookies”) – for a general explanation of how Opt-out Cookies work, please    <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">click here</a>.
    Therefore, if you buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete these
    Opt-out Cookies from your computer, you will need to perform the opt-out
    task again.
</p>
<p>
    You may be able to direct your internet browser not to allow cookies and
    you can delete existing cookies from your computer. Please note, however,
    some elements of our Sites will not function properly or be available to
    you.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>VI. Security of information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We use a secure server hosting location in the U, firewall protection,
    controlled access and encryption technology to protect your data. Please be
    advised, however, that while we strive to protect your information, we
    cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or
    transmit to us over the internet.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>VIII. Privacy Shield</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Connexity (and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Connexity Audience, Inc.)
    participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. Connexity is
    committed to subjecting all personal data received from EU member
    countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield, to the principles underlying
    the Privacy Shield (the “Principles”). To learn more about the EU-U.S.
    Privacy Shield program, and to view Connexity’s certification, please visit
the U.S. Department of Commerce site at    <u>https://www.privacyshield.gov</u>/.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>IX. Accountability for Onward Transfer</strong>
</p>
<p>
        If we transfer personal data received from EU member countries, in
        reliance on the Privacy Shield, to a third party acting as a
        controller, we will do so consistent with any notice provided to data
        subjects and any consent they have given, and only if the third party
        has given us contractual assurances that it will (i) process the
        personal data for limited and specific purposes consistent with any
        consent provided by the data subjects; (ii) provide at least the same
        level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles and notify
        us if it makes a determination it cannot do so; and (iii) cease
        processing of the personal data or take other reasonable and
        appropriate steps to remediate if it makes such a determination. If
        Connexity has knowledge that a third party acting as a controller is
        processing such personal data in a way that is contrary to the
        Principles, Connexity will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop
        such processing.
</p>
<p>
    With respect to our third-party agents, we will transfer only the personal
    data needed for an agent to deliver to Connexity the requested product or
    service. Furthermore, we will (i) permit the agent to process such personal
    data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) require the agent to
    provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the
    Principles; (iii) take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the
    agent effectively processes the personal data transferred in a manner
    consistent with Connexity’s obligations under the Principles; and (iv)
    require the agent to notify Connexity if it makes a determination that it
    can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection
    as is required by the Principles. Upon receiving notice from an agent that
    it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of
    protection as is required by the Principles, we will take reasonable and
    appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing.
</p>
<p>
    Connexity remains liable under the Principles if an agent processes
    personal data received from EU member countries, in reliance on the Privacy
    Shield, in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, except where
    Connexity is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
</p>
