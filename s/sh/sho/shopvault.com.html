            This Privacy Policy will explain the following regarding use of our site:</p>
        <p class="title">
            What information does VAULT collect from you?</p>
        <p>
            In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, VAULT collects
            two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information
            and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information
            from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while
            using our site.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong> This refers to information
            that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information
            about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways. This information
            is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example,
            this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that
            you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your
            Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other
            resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or
            device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network,
            such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route
            information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address
            is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing
            the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require
            IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</p>
        <p>
            On an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous data related to the pages, products,
            downloads and other content that is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for,
            transferred from and downloaded. Except as otherwise limited in this Policy, we
            may disclose, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally Identifiable Information to others
            without your consent.</p>
        <p class="title">
            Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</p>
        <p>
            Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide VAULT's visitors
            with a superior customized online experience. We use the customer contact information
            to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform them of their order status, to send
            promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and administer our
            systems.</p>
        <p>
            Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party advertising
            servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents who provide us with the zip
            code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on
            our site. We review the actions of the VAULT visitors on an aggregate basis to determine
            customers' preferences. VAULT also does research on our visitors' demographics,
            interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering,
            a promotion, from our server log files, from our web site analysis agents, or from
            contests, drawings or surveys. We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience
            at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically
            analyze site use, to improve our product offerings, and to customize our site's
            content, layout, and services. We receive reports from third party ad servers, content
            servers, or web site analysis agents that tells us how many ads were presented and
            clicked upon or what content was served or viewed.</p>
        <p>
            We may also share your personally identifiable information with third parties who
            provide services to us, our customers and web site visitors. Those third parties
            include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies
            working with us (collectively, "agents"). Where we believe it to be appropriate
            (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or use your personal
            information for purposes other than to provide services to you or VAULT.</p>
        <p class="title">
            We gather information in the following ways:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Shopping</strong> We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration,
            to gather broad demographic information, to enable ads to be served on our site,

            the level of activity on our site. We collect information from visitors to our site

            browser type used to come to the site, the country, state and telephone area code
            where their servers are located, the pages and page titles of our site that visitors
            viewed during their visit, whether the visitor's computer is enabled for Java or
            cookies, browser language, applications and plug-ins, and any search terms entered
            on our site.</p>
        <p>

            information from you. If you order one of our products or services, we will collect

            collect this, and other information, as disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill
            your order, to communicate with you about your order and to send you promotional
            materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review
            the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contained
            and these changes will be automatically kept for future use. We may require additional
            verifications or information before accepting any order.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Newsletters,Promotional E-mails and Personalized On-line Ads</strong> We
            offer free newsletters and promotional e-mails and personalized on-line advertisements
            as a service to our customers. We will send you newsletters and e-mails periodically
            listing current specials and deals. You may "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our newsletters,
            emails or personalized on-line advertisements by following any unsubscribe instructions
            in any e-mail, newsletter or personalized on-line advertisement you receive from
            us.After doing so, if you have opted out of receiving all newsletters, all promotional
            emails or all personalized on-line ads, you will not receive future promotional
            emails, newsletters or personalized on-line advertisements (as applicable), unless
            you open a new account, enter a contest, or otherwise subsequently sign up to receive
            newsletters, emails or personalized on-line advertisements. <strong>Please Note: If
                you agree to receive e-mails from any of our third party service providers or any
                third party merchants on our site, you will receive e-mails separately from them,
                and information that you choose to disclose to them will be subject to their privacy
                policy. If you later decide that you no longer want to receive their e-mails, you
                will need to follow their own specific opt-out instructions, as opting out as described above will not opt
                you out of their promotional emails.</strong></p>
        <p>
            <strong>Contact Information and Third Party Data</strong> If you contact VAULT or
            our customer service representatives by telephone, e-mail or letter, we may keep
            a record of your correspondence or comments. If you report a problem with our site,
            we may collect such information in a file specific to you. If you contact us through
            our feedback area or by calling one of our customer service representatives, we
            may ask for your name, e-mail address and order information in order to send you
            a reply. If other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities
            or purchases on our site, we may keep the information in a file specific to you.</p>

            <strong>Customer Service</strong> We use a third party to help us provide customer

            a little about you, VAULT will be able to deliver more relevant advertisements and
            content to you in the form of targeted banners and promotions. For example, advertisers
            give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach. VAULT
            takes the advertisement and includes it in a VAULT e-mail to prior customers meeting
            that criterion. We may also have third-party advertising servers display ads linked
            to certain search terms that you have entered, or to certain pages that you are
            viewing. In this process, advertisers never have access to individual account information.
            VAULT may share aggregated data with advertisers. We may also use advertising partners
            to assist us in delivering personalized on-line ads to you through the use of cookies

            to third parties, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable
            Information. We may release account information when we believe that such release
            is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or to protect the rights,
            property, and safety of Buy.com, our users, or others. If customers do not pay us
            for products ordered, we may submit their account information to a third party collection
            agency. We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties
            who provide services to us, our customers and web site visitors. Those third parties
            include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies
            working with us such as Buy Services (collectively, "agents"). Where we believe
            it to be appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose
            or use your personal information for purposes other than to provide services to
            you or Buy.com.</p>

            <strong>Products Advertised on Our Site</strong> Where you order or sign up for
            goods or services offered through our site, but sold directly to you by a third
            party or fulfilled by a third party, we give your personal information to that third
            party to facilitate the sale of such goods or services (e.g., our Cellular Store
            and any magazine offers available on our site).

            <strong>Data Analysis Agents</strong> The information collected by or for VAULT

            is to help us to improve our site and product selection, and to notify you of special
            offers that may be of interest to you. That data analysis agent may not share any
            Personally Identifiable Information with others, or use it for any other purpose

            Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or
            to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation, without prior notice to you.
            VAULT fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use

            <strong>Sale of the Company</strong> VAULT and its affiliated companies (including
            without limitation, Buy.com, BuyServices, Yub and BuyMusic) each reserve the right
            to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information in the event that any such
            company is sold, in whole or in part, either as an entire corporate entity or through
            an asset sale that includes a customer information database. This right is reserved
            whether or not the customer database is sold independently of any continuing operations
            of such company.

            <strong>How can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information?</strong>
            We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the personal information
            that you have provided to us. During the online ordering process you can review,
            change, or delete the information that you have submitted. You may change any of
            your personal information in your account online at any time. We encourage you to
            promptly update your information if it changes. You may ask to have the information
            on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past purchases,
            you cannot delete information associated with past purchases. Also, as a security
            measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information
            cannot be completely removed from our databases. As a result, you should not expect
            that all of your Personally Identifiable Information will be completely removed
            from our backed-up databases.</p>

            Cookies: When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order to
            facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file,
            which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits)
            that can later be retrieved to identify you to Buy.com. Our cookies store randomly
            assigned user identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your
            first name to welcome you back to our site. The cookies make your use of the site
            easier, allow you to retrieve an earlier shopping cart, make the site run more smoothly
            and help us to maintain a secure site. You will be unable to shop on our site without
            your browser set to accept cookies. Ad Server and Content Server Cookies: We may
            use an outside ad serving company or content server to display banner advertisements
            and other information on our site and other sites or to serve promotional emails
            or personalized on-line ads. As part of their service, they place a separate cookie
            on your computer. Except for the company that serves our promotional emails and
            the company that serves personalized on-line ads, VAULT does not provide third-party
            ad servers with any of your Personally Identifiable Information. VAULT and its third
            party ad servers do collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about
            you, such as your IP address, browser type, the URLs from which you came, referring
            site's domain types (e.g., .com), operating system, the country, the server your
            computer is logged onto, where the servers that your computer is logged onto is
            located, the pages of our site and products that visitors viewed during their visit,
            where an ad was placed on a specific web site page, the time and date particular
            ads were served, the area code and zip code associated with your server and whether
            you responded to a particular ad, and a receipt identifier. 
            Personalized On-line Ad Serving: We may provide the company that serves our personalized
            on-line ads with your first name and/or with a product group/category (chosen by
            VAULT based on your personal preferences and/or prior purchase history e.g., apparel,
            electronics, books etc), which are used to serve you the most relevant personalized
            on-line ad. The unique identifier included within the cookie placed tells the ad
            serving company to serve you a personalized on-line ad when you visit the site of
            a participating web site within the network. The foregoing personally identifying
            information is not disclosed to the participating web sites. Our third-party ad
            servers will occasionally use outside agents, whose computers will serve ads on
            our site in the same manner and under the same conditions as above. In addition,
            other ad serving companies or advertisers may place banner ads on our site in the
            same manner as above, but accept as disclosed in this policy we do not disclose
            to them any Personally Identifiable Information. Image Server Cookies: As part of
            the ad-serving process, a third party may serve graphics upon our site. In order
            to customize their service, they may also place a cookie upon your computer. While
            VAULT does not control their use of that cookie, no Personally Identifiable or individual
            customers' product information is collected. 
            Website Analysis Agent Cookies: We may use a third party to analyze what our visitors
            find to be most interesting on our site. To do that, they will place a cookie on
            your computer with a randomly assigned unique number in order to track the pages
            you view on our site, along with other Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
            Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon
            (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or
            actions by customers who view certain advertisements or other information on our
            site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used
            to transparently collect information. Our ad server, content servers, affiliate
            program manager and website analysis agents may use action tags to count the number
            of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our
            site and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased. Without
            collecting any personally identifiable information, they use that data to tell us
            (and other advertisers) which ads are the most effective on particular sites. Our
            ad server, content server, affiliate program manager and website analysis agents
            may use an action tag on our basket page, checkout page, and other pages, to keep
            anonymous track of the number of times that clicking on a banner ad or views other
            information on our siteresults in a purchase. They also collect the amount of the
            purchase, order confirmation number, stock keeping unit number, quantity and identity
            of product purchased. E-mail Distributor's Use of Action Tags: Our third-party e-mail
            distributor may also use action tags. They may, for example, keep track of when
            a promotional e-mail is opened and provide VAULT with ongoing aggregated reports
            of how many customers have responded. We share with them web site usage information
            about visitors to our web site who have received a promotional e-mail or other targeted
            promotional campaign. They use the information for the purpose of targeting future
            campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this
            purpose, we and our third-party e-mail distributor note some of the pages you visit
            on our web site through the use of action tags. </p>

            Referring Friends to VAULT</p>
        <p>
            We enable you to refer friends to VAULT. You may be eligible to receive referral
            credit if someone that you refer to VAULT makes a purchase. If you wish to refer
            friends, we provide you a unique referral link which you can share directly with
            others via message from VAULT, e-mail, social media websites, or other communication
            methods. If someone clicks your link and takes a qualifying action, we may attribute
            that referral to you for purposes such as awarding you referral credit. We do not
            collect any Personal or Non-Personal Information about the persons with whom you
            share your link until the persons click the link and engage directly with VAULT.
            If a person clicks the link, the VAULT website automatically collects Non-Personal
            Information, which may include the person's IP address, ISP, and other Non-Personal
            Information. Personal Information is only collected if the person chooses to sign
            up and become a member of VAULT.</p>
        <p class="title">
            Credits</p>
        <p>
            VAULT's credit for new-member referrals is a rebate paid immediately by VAULT, and
            not merchants offering products to VAULT members. Referral credits are promotional
            only, carry no cash value and can only be used for purchases on the VAULT website.
            New member referral credit expires 90 days from the date it is issued and is not
            transferrable. In addition to credit for returns, vouchers and gift cards, which
            never expire, VAULT will also from time to time issue various other credits. VAULT,
            and not our merchants issue the credit. These other credits carry no cash value
            and can only be used for purchases on the VAULT website. These credits expire ninety
            (90) days after issue, and are not transferrable.</p>
        <p>
            VAULT reserved the rights to cancel, change, discontinue and/or revoke this program,
            terms, conditions and any compensation stated or implied without notice. Expired
            credits cannot be reactivated.</p>
        <p class="title">
            Invite Friends</p>
        <p>
            VAULT's "Invite Friends" program is designed to reward existing members with the
            opportunity to earn access to special promotions and benefits by referring friends
            to join VAULT. VAULT, and not brands or retailers who offer their products to our
            members, issue credit for new member referrals. Existing members are only eligible
            to earn referral credits after new members they have invited to the VAULT website
            make at least one completed and shipped purchase within the first 90 days of your
            invited friends' membership, excluding gift cards or vouchers.</p>
        <p>
            Referral credits granted by any means other than as a result of the initial completed
            and shipped purchase by a new member introduced for the first time to VAULT by the
            referring member are in violation of these terms and conditions. You may not use
            spam or any other method prohibited by law to obtain referral credits, and you agree
            not to send invitations to join the Site to people who do not know you or are unlikely
            to recognize you as a known contact. You may not participate in the program if any
            applicable laws or regulations prohibit doing so. Any referral credits granted in
            violation of these terms and conditions are null and void and subject to immediate
            cancellation or termination of all referral credits. We reserve the right to modify
            or amend these terms and conditions at any time and the methods by which special
            promotions or benefits are earned.</p>
