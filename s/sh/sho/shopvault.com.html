                This Privacy Policy will explain the following regarding use of our site:</p>
            <p class="title">
                What information does VAULT collect from you?</p>
            <p>
                In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, VAULT collects
                two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information
                and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information
                from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while
                using our site.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong> This refers to information
                that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information
                about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways. This information
                is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example,
                this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that
                you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your
                Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other
                resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or
                device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network,
                such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route
                information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address
                is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing
                the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require
                IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</p>

                On an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous data related to the pages, products,
                downloads and other content that is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for,

                Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</p>
            <p>
                Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide VAULT's visitors
                with a superior customized online experience. We use the customer contact information
                to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform them of their order status, to send
                promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and administer our
                systems.</p>
            <p>
                Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party advertising
                servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents who provide us with the zip
                code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on
                our site. We review the actions of the VAULT visitors on an aggregate basis to determine
                customers' preferences. VAULT also does research on our visitors' demographics,
                interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering,
                a promotion, from our server log files, from our web site analysis agents, or from
                contests, drawings or surveys. We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience
                at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically
                analyze site use, to improve our product offerings, and to customize our site's
                content, layout, and services. We receive reports from third party ad servers, content
                servers, or web site analysis agents that tells us how many ads were presented and
                clicked upon or what content was served or viewed.</p>

                include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies
                working with us (collectively, "agents"). Where we believe it to be appropriate
                (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or use your personal
                information for purposes other than to provide services to you or VAULT.</p>

                <strong>Advertising</strong> We may display advertisements on our site. By knowing
                a little about you, VAULT will be able to deliver more relevant advertisements and
                content to you in the form of targeted banners and promotions. For example, advertisers
                give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach. VAULT
                takes the advertisement and includes it in a VAULT e-mail to prior customers meeting
                that criterion. We may also have third-party advertising servers display ads linked
                to certain search terms that you have entered, or to certain pages that you are
                viewing. In this process, advertisers never have access to individual account information.
                VAULT may share aggregated data with advertisers. We may also use advertising partners
                to assist us in delivering personalized on-line ads to you through the use of cookies

                Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon
                (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or
                actions by customers who view certain advertisements or other information on our
                site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used
                to transparently collect information. Our ad server, content servers, affiliate
                program manager and website analysis agents may use action tags to count the number
                of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our
                site and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased. Without
                collecting any personally identifiable information, they use that data to tell us
                (and other advertisers) which ads are the most effective on particular sites. Our
                ad server, content server, affiliate program manager and website analysis agents
                may use an action tag on our basket page, checkout page, and other pages, to keep
                anonymous track of the number of times that clicking on a banner ad or views other
                information on our siteresults in a purchase. They also collect the amount of the
                purchase, order confirmation number, stock keeping unit number, quantity and identity
                of product purchased. E-mail Distributor's Use of Action Tags: Our third-party e-mail
                distributor may also use action tags. They may, for example, keep track of when
                a promotional e-mail is opened and provide VAULT with ongoing aggregated reports
                of how many customers have responded. We share with them web site usage information
                about visitors to our web site who have received a promotional e-mail or other targeted
                promotional campaign. They use the information for the purpose of targeting future
                campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this
                purpose, we and our third-party e-mail distributor note some of the pages you visit
                on our web site through the use of action tags. </p>
