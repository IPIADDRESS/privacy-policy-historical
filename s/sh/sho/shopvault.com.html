            <p>At VAULT, your privacy is a top priority. Please read our privacy policy details.</p>
            
            <p class="title">Overview</p>
            <p>Our VAULT marketplace  allows you to buy products and services, enter contests, receive special  discounts, fill out surveys, and receive newsletters, e-mails or other  promotional information from us. We use the information that we collect about  you to fulfill your product and service purchases and to create a more  personalized online experience. This is just a brief overview, so please read  on for more details about our Privacy Policy. This Policy may change from time  to time, so please check back periodically. Except as limited below, we reserve  the right to use or disclose your personally identifiable information for  business reasons in whatever manner desired.</p>
            <p>To ensure the highest  quality purchasing experience for you, we have relationships with our  affiliated companies, including without limitation, Buy.com, Inc. and BuyServices  Inc. ("BuyServices") to operate certain portions of our site and  provide site related and other services. All information collected from you  will be shared with VAULT and its affiliate companies.</p>
            <p>Except as otherwise  discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and  disclosure of information we collect from you online. For some services, either  we collect and transfer personal information to a service provider you have  selected or you may visit other merchants through links on our site, who may  collect and use your personal information. &nbsp;In those cases the third-party service  provider or merchant's privacy policy will govern how your information is  handled. We encourage you to ask questions and to be very cautious before you  disclose your personal information to others.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy  will explain the following regarding use of our site:</p>
            
            <p class="title">What information does VAULT collect from you?</p>
            <p>In order to better  provide you with numerous products and services, VAULT collects two types of  information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and  Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting  information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized  experience while using our site.</p>
            <p><strong>Personally  Identifiable Information</strong> Personally Identifiable Information is  information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. We may collect  Personally Identifiable Information when you register and set up an account, order  a product or service, register for a Gift List, enter contests or sweepstakes,  apply for credit, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. &nbsp;For example, Personally Identifiable  Information might include your name, billing address, shipping address,  telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and  product details. With this information, VAULT can fill your orders and better  provide you with personalized services. For a few services, we may collect your  Personally Identifiable Information on behalf of other merchants and share it  with them.&nbsp; <strong><em>If you visit one of the stores  available through a link on our site, then you should be aware that they will  independently collect, use and share your Personally Identifiable Information  in accordance with their own privacy policies.</em></strong> If you have questions  about their information practices, then please read their privacy policies. In  many cases, you can find a link to their privacy policies on the page offering  the Partners' services.</p>
            <p><strong>Non-Personally  Identifiable Information</strong> This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific  individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you shop  on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both  a personal and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include  the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came  from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet  Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and  other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a  computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol  ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web  use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the  destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically  assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web  servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in  order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</p>
            <p>On an aggregated  basis, we collect anonymous data related to the pages, products, downloads and  other content that is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for, transferred  from and downloaded.
                <br>
                Except as otherwise  limited in this Policy, we may disclose, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally  Identifiable Information to others without your consent.

            <p class="title">Where do we collect information from you and  how do we use it?</p>
            <p>Our primary goal in  collecting personal information is to provide VAULT's visitors with a superior  customized online experience. We use the customer contact information to fill  orders, process payments, contact purchasers to inform them of their order  status, to send promotional information, and to enhance the operation of our  site and administer our systems.</p>
            <p>Demographic data also  may be collected at our site from third party advertising servers, content  servers, or web site analysis agents who provide us with the zip code and area  code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on our site.  We review the actions of the VAULT visitors on an aggregate basis to determine  customers' preferences. VAULT also does research on our visitors' demographics,  interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during  ordering, a promotion, from our server log files, from our web site analysis  agents, or from contests, drawings or surveys. We will use this data to tailor  the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional  efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product offerings,  and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. We receive reports  from third party ad servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents that  tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content was served  or viewed.</p>
            <p>We may also share your  Personally Identifiable Information with third parties who provide services to  us, our customers and web site visitors. Those third parties include authorized  contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies working  with us (collectively, "agents"). Where we believe it to be  appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or  use your personal information for purposes other than to provide services to  you or VAULT.</p>
            
            <p class="title">We gather information in the following ways:</p>
            <p><strong>Shopping</strong> We collect IP addresses for the purposes of  system administration, to gather broad demographic information, to enable ads  to be served on our site, to report Non-Personally Identifiable Information to  our advertisers, and to monitor the level of activity on our site. We collect  information from visitors to our site regarding the URLs they came from, domain  types (e.g., .com or .org), their IP addresses, the date and time of their  visit or order, the number of visits and orders, the number of visits per  browsing session, the server type, the operating system and browser type used  to come to the site, the country, state and telephone area code where their  servers are located, the pages and page titles of our site that visitors viewed  during their visit, whether the visitor's computer is enabled for Java or  cookies, browser language, applications and plug-ins, and any search terms  entered on our site.</p>
            <p><strong>Ordering</strong> When you order from us, we collect Personally  Identifiable Information from you. If you order one of our products or  services, then we will collect and maintain your name, gender, e-mail address,  billing address, shipping address, telephone number, product selections, credit  card or other payment information, order number, referring URL, IP address,  page you bought from and a password. We collect this and other information as  disclosed in this Policy in order to fill your order, to communicate with you  about your order, and to send you promotional materials. Before confirming your  order you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make  changes and additions to the information it contains and those changes will be  automatically kept for future use. We may require additional verifications or  information before accepting any order.</p>
            <p><strong>Newsletters, Promotional  E-mails and Personalized On-line Ads</strong> We offer free newsletters and promotional e-mails and  personalized on-line advertisements as a service to our customers. We will send  you newsletters and e-mails periodically listing current specials and deals.  You may "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our newsletters, emails or  personalized on-line advertisements by following any unsubscribe instructions  in any e-mail, newsletter or personalized on-line advertisement that you  receive from us. After doing so, if you have opted out of receiving all  newsletters, all promotional emails or all personalized on-line ads, then you  will not such communications in the future , unless you open a new account,  enter a contest, or otherwise subsequently sign up to receive newsletters,  emails or personalized on-line advertisements. <strong><em>Please Note: If you agree to receive e-mails from any of our third  party service providers or any third party merchants on our site, then you will  receive e-mails separately from them, and information that you choose to  disclose to them will be subject to their privacy policy. If you later decide  that you no longer want to receive their e-mails, then you will need to follow  their own specific opt-out instructions as opting out as described above will  not opt you out of their promotional emails.</em></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Contact Information  and Third Party Data</strong> If you contact VAULT  or our customer service representatives by telephone, e-mail or letter, then we  may keep a record of your correspondence or comments. If you report a problem  with our site, then we may collect such information in a file specific to you.  If you contact us through our feedback area or by calling one of our customer  service representatives, then we may ask for your name, e-mail address and  order information in order to send you a reply. If other users or third parties  send us correspondence about your activities or purchases on our site, then we  may keep the information in a file specific to you.</p>
            <p><strong>Customer Service</strong> We use a third party to help us provide  customer service. In order to help you most effectively, we provide them with  your order information.</p>
            <p><strong>Affiliate Program</strong> Our Affiliate Program (Affiliate Connection)  is administered by a third party, on a third party's Web site. Any information  collected by them is not governed by this Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Advertising</strong> We may display advertisements on our site. By  knowing a little about you, VAULT will be able to deliver more relevant  advertisements and content to you in the form of targeted banners and  promotions. For example, advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the  type of audience they want to reach. VAULT will then include it in a VAULT  e-mail to prior customers meeting that criterion. We may also have third-party  advertising servers display ads linked to certain search terms that you have  entered, or to certain pages that you are viewing. In this process, advertisers  never have access to individual account information. VAULT may share aggregated  data with advertisers. We may also use advertising partners to assist us in  delivering personalized on-line ads to you through the use of cookies while you  are on the Internet.</p>
            <p><strong>Web Site Use</strong> We also track customers' traffic patterns  throughout their online session, including which pages, information and  advertisements a customer views while using the site and what items they place  in their basket or purchase. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with  our servers, software, to administer our site and to gather demographic  information. We may share aggregated statistics about pages viewed on our site,  sales and other shopping information with third parties.</p>
            <p><strong>Cookies</strong> We use cookies and may allow others to use  cookies in the operation of our site; to find out what cookies are and how they  are used, <a href="http://www.shopvault.com/privacy#useof">click here</a>.</p>

This information includes your  "ship to" information and your email address.</p>
            
            <p class="title">Who is collecting your information?</p>
            <p><strong>Ad Servers and Content  Servers</strong> We may use third  party ad servers or content servers to serve ads, product information, or other  information both on and off our site. Those third parties may use "action  tags" or web beacons throughout the site to count the number of visitors  who click on a banner ad or other information and to track the number of  customers who continue on to make a purchase. They may also place their own  "cookie" on your computer to help those ads to run, analyze site  usage and to provide you with personalized on-line advertisements. With respect  to personalized on-line ad serving, our third party ad server may collect your  first name and/or a product group/category (chosen by VAULT based on your  personal preferences and/or prior purchase history e.g., Apparel, shoes, electronics),  which are used to serve you the most relevant personalized on-line ad. For more  information about the information they collect, please see the section  "Use of Cookies and Action Tags" below. </p>
            <p><strong>Image Servers</strong> We use a third party image serving company to  serve the graphics that visitors see on our site more quickly. They collect a  visitor's IP address and the URLs of any graphics viewed and the date and time  of the visit. However, they do not collect and we do not provide them with any  Personally Identifiable Information. They may also use a "cookie." </p>
            <p><strong>Email Services</strong> We use a third party to send promotional  e-mails to customers. Images contained in the email may be served by the third  party. They collect certain information about you such as your IP address,  browser type, your operating system, the country and server your computer is  logged onto, where the servers that your computer is logged onto is located,  the time and date that a particular email was viewed, the area code and zip  code associated with your server, and whether you responded to a particular ad  or email, products viewed and whether you continued on to make a purchase. They  may use a "cookie" or "action tags." </p>
            <p><strong>Website Analysis Agent</strong> We may contract with several online partners  to help manage and optimize our Internet business and marketing. We use the services  of marketing companies to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising  and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Action Tags and cookies  provided by the marketing companies on this site. The type of information we  collect includes things such as pages, information and advertisements viewed as  well as what items are placed in a shopping basket or purchased, the order  number, the amount of a purchase, the product number and the quantity  purchased. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things  like what kinds of customers our site attracts, which of our products most  interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.  Although the marketing companies log the information coming from our site on  our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. For more  information, please see the section "VAULT and third party Use of Cookies  and Action Tags" below.</p>
            <p><strong>Marketing Partners,  Co-Branded Services, Framing/Windows on Third-Party Sites</strong> We may run promotions for merchants where you  may visit the merchants' sites. In some of those promotions, a window or frame  containing the merchant's site may appear. Any time you are in a window, you  should assume that your personal information is being collected, used and  disclosed in accordance with that merchant's policies. This Privacy Policy does  not apply to information that you supply to those merchants. Any information  that you share with them will be used and disclosed in accordance with that  merchant's privacy policy. However, once you click on a return link to our  site, you can expect that further information that you disclose will be treated  in accordance with this Policy.</p>
            <p>On occasion,  unaffiliated third parties will "frame" VAULT's site in an effort to  collect customer information. To ensure your privacy, make sure that your order  originates from VAULT's site. VAULT is not in any manner responsible in the  event that you do disclose information to an unaffiliated framing site.</p>
            <p><strong>Links and Banner Ads  to Third-Party Sites</strong> Please be aware that  our site may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and  operated by third parties. The information practices of those websites linking  from or to our site are not covered by this Policy. These other sites may send  their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.  Additionally, other companies or ad servers, which place advertising on our  site may collect information about you through the use of cookies when you view  or click on their advertising. We cannot control this collection of  information. You should contact advertisers directly if you have any questions  about their use of the information that they collect.</p>
            <p><strong>Marketplace</strong> As a buyer on the VAULT Marketplace, your personal  information is collected by sellers as reasonably necessary to ship the  products to you and to communicate with you regarding those purchases and any  issues that may arise in connection with your purchase. This information  includes your "ship to" information and your email address. However,  VAULT cannot control any such collection, use and/or disclosure by buyers or  sellers, and shall have no liability for any act or omission by a buyer or  seller with respect to such information.</p>
            
            <p class="title">With whom do we share your information?</p>
            <p><strong>Fulfillment</strong> The information collected by VAULT, Buy.com,  and BuyServices is used for processing orders, keeping you informed about your  order status, for statistical purposes, for improving our site and its  performance, to serve ads, and to notify you of products or special offers that  may be of interest to you. We will disclose your Personally Identifiable  Information to third parties to charge your credit card, fill your order,  deliver your order, provide customer service, provide you with credit and  deliver promotional e-mails to you from VAULT and its affiliates. For example,  we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to  confirm payment; and release your address and telephone information to the  delivery service to deliver products that you ordered. As mentioned previously,  your Personally Identifiable Information is shared with BuyServices and our  other third-party fulfillment partners and service providers, and with certain  other merchants on our site.</p>
            <p><strong>Other Parties  Generally</strong> We may provide  Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers' sales, traffic  patterns, and related site information to third parties, but these statistics  do not include any Personally Identifiable Information. We may release account  information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to  enforce or apply our Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property, and  safety ofVAULT, our users, or others. If customers do not pay us for products  ordered, then we may submit their account information to a third party  collection agency. We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information  with third parties who provide services to us, our customers and web site  visitors. Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary  employees and consultants and other companies working with us such as Buy  Services (collectively, "agents"). Where we believe it to be  appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or  use your personal information for purposes other than to provide services to  you or Buy.com.</p>
            <p><strong>Products Advertised on  Our Site</strong> Where you order or  sign up for goods or services offered through our site, but sold directly to  you by a third party or fulfilled by a third party, we give your personal  information to that third party to facilitate the sale of such goods or  services. </p>
            <p><strong>Data Analysis Agents</strong> The information collected by or for VAULT may  be provided to an outside company for the purpose of analysis. That analysis is  to help us to improve our site and product selection, and to notify you of  special offers that may be of interest to you. That data analysis agent may not  share any Personally Identifiable Information with others, or use it for any  other purpose than to help VAULT.</p>
            <p><strong>Ad &amp; Content  Servers, Advertisers, Image Servers and Website Analysis Agents</strong> These third parties use their cookies' identification  numbers and internal web site tracking features to serve ads on our site and to  collect aggregated information to create statistics about our customers and  visitors, traffic patterns, and related site information. In the event that our  ad servers collect any Personally Identifiable Information on our behalf, it  will not be used by them or disclosed to any third parties. </p>
            <p><strong>Compliance with  Service of Process or Law Enforcement</strong> Occasionally VAULT may be asked by law enforcement or judicial  authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate  governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information  upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement  investigation, without prior notice to you. VAULT fully cooperates with law  enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal  activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any  activities that we believe to be unlawful. </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Marketplace</strong> As a buyer on the VAULT Marketplace, we share  your personal information with sellers as reasonably necessary to ship the  products to you and to communicate with you regarding purchases and any issues  that may arise in connection with your purchase. This information includes your  "ship to" information and your email address.
                <br>
                <strong>Sale of the Company</strong> VAULT and its affiliated companies (including  without limitation, Buy.com and BuyServices) each reserve the right to disclose  your Personally Identifiable Information in the event that any such company is  sold, in whole or in part, either as an entire corporate entity or through an  asset sale that includes a customer information database. This right is  reserved whether or not the customer database is sold independently of any  continuing operations of such company.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How can you update or  correct your Personally Identifiable Information?</strong> We believe you should have the ability to  access and edit the personal information that you have provided to us. During  the online ordering process you can review, change, or delete the information  that you have submitted. You may change any of your personal information in  your account online at any time. We encourage you to promptly update your  information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account  deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past purchases, you  cannot delete information associated with past purchases. Also, as a security  measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior  information cannot be completely removed from our databases. As a result, you  should not expect that all of your Personally Identifiable Information will be  completely removed from our backed-up databases.</p>
            
            <p class="title">What are your choices regarding collection, use,  and distribution of your information?</p>
            <p>You may  "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our newsletters, emails or  personalized on-line advertisements by following any unsubscribe instructions  in any e-mail, newsletter or personalized on-line advertisement you receive  from us, or by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:optout@shopvault.com">optout@shopvault.com</a>.

            <p class="title">What about “Do Not Track” signals?</p>
            <p>Our website does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals.&nbsp; There is currently no universally recognized  standard for “Do Not Track” signals.&nbsp; The  World Wide Web Consortium is still working towards establishing a uniform “Do  Not Track” web browser mechanism.&nbsp;  Accordingly, at this time, our website does not respond to any “Do Not  Track” signals.</p>
            
            <p class="title">What security precautions are in place to  protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?</p>
            <p>In order to most  efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are  handled by established third party banking, processing agents and distribution  institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your  credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.  Wherever possible and applicable, VAULT servers reside behind a corporate  firewall that maintains controls on access to the system from both our internal  network and the Internet. </p>

            <p class="title">VAULT and third-party use of  "cookies" and "action tags."<em><u> </u></em></p>
            <p><strong>VAULT Cookies</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;When you use our site we will store cookies on  your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A  cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's  hard drive (if your Web browser permits) and that can later be retrieved to  identify you to Buy.com. Our cookies store randomly assigned user  identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your first name  to welcome you back to our site. The cookies make your use of the site easier,  allow you to retrieve an earlier shopping cart, make the site run more smoothly  and help us to maintain a secure site. You will be unable to shop on our site  without your browser set to accept cookies. </p>
            <p><strong>Ad Server and Content Server Cookies</strong>&nbsp; We may  use an outside ad serving company or content server to display banner  advertisements and other information on our site and other sites or to serve  promotional emails or personalized on-line ads. As part of their service, they  place a separate cookie on your computer. Except for the company that serves  our promotional emails and the company that serves personalized on-line ads,  VAULT does not provide third-party ad servers with any of your Personally  Identifiable Information. VAULT and its third party ad servers do collect and use  Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, such as your IP address,  browser type, the URLs from which you came, referring site's domain types  (e.g., .com), operating system, the country, the server your computer is logged  onto, where the servers that your computer is logged onto is located, the pages  of our site and products that visitors viewed during their visit, where an ad  was placed on a specific web site page, the time and date particular ads were  served, the area code and zip code associated with your server and whether you  responded to a particular ad, and a receipt identifier.</p>
            <p><strong>Personalized On-line Ad Serving</strong>: We may provide the company that serves our  personalized on-line ads with your first name and/or with a product  group/category (chosen by VAULT based upon your personal preferences and/or  prior purchase history) that are used to serve you the most relevant  personalized on-line ad. The unique identifier included within the cookie  placed tells the ad serving company to serve you a personalized on-line ad when  you visit the site of a participating web site within the network. The  foregoing Personally Identifiable information is not disclosed to the  participating web sites. Our third-party ad servers will occasionally use  outside agents, whose computers will serve ads on our site in the same manner  and under the same conditions as above. In addition, other ad serving companies  or advertisers may place banner ads on our site in the same manner as above,  but except as disclosed in this policy we do not disclose any Personally  Identifiable Information to them. </p>
            <p><strong>Image Server Cookies</strong> As part of the ad-serving process, a third  party may serve graphics upon our site. In order to customize their service,  they may also place a cookie upon your computer. While VAULT does not control  their use of that cookie, no Personally Identifiable or individual customers'  product information is collected. </p>
            <p><strong>Website Analysis Agent Cookies</strong> We may use a third party to analyze what our  visitors find to be most interesting on our site. To do that, they will place a  cookie on your computer with a randomly assigned unique number in order to track  the pages you view on our site, along with other Non-Personally Identifiable  Information. </p>
            <p><strong>Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data  Collection Methods</strong> &nbsp;An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a  clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by  customers who view certain advertisements or other information on our site.  Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to  transparently collect information. Our ad server, content servers, affiliate program  manager and website analysis agents may use action tags to count the number of  times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our  site and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased.  Without collecting any personally identifiable information, they use that data  to tell us (and other advertisers) which ads are the most effective on  particular sites. Our ad server, content server, affiliate program manager and  website analysis agents may use an action tag on our basket page, checkout  page, and other pages, to keep anonymous track of the number of times that  clicking on a banner ad or views other information on our site results in a  purchase. They also collect the amount of the purchase, order confirmation  number, stock keeping unit number, quantity and identity of product purchased. </p>
            <p><strong>E-mail Distributor's Use of Action Tags</strong> Our third-party e-mail distributor may also  use action tags. They may, for example, keep track of when a promotional e-mail  is opened and provide VAULT with ongoing aggregated reports of how many  customers have responded. We share with them web site usage information about  visitors to our web site who have received a promotional e-mail or other  targeted promotional campaign. They use the information for the purpose of  targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting  statistics. For this purpose, we and our third-party e-mail distributor note  some of the pages you visit on our web site through the use of action tags. </p>
            <p><strong>You should carefully  review privacy policies of any third party sites accessible from VAULT</strong> Other sites accessible through our web site  have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure  practices.

If you wish to refer friends, then we provide you a  unique referral link which you can share directly with others via message from  VAULT, e-mail, social media websites, or other communication methods. If  someone clicks your link and takes a qualifying action, we may attribute that  referral to you for purposes such as awarding you referral credit.
