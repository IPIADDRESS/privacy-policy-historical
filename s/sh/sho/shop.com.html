Information From Others.<br> SHOP.COM is constantly improving the products and services we provide our consumers. To aid in serving you better we may supplement personally identifiable information that we have collected directly from our customers with other information that we obtain from third parties or from our partner stores. In addition, we may obtain information about individuals who are not yet users of SHOP.COM. To insure your privacy when we associate information that we obtain from third parties with personally identifiable information that we have collected under this Privacy Policy, we will treat the acquired information like the information that we collected ourselves and, except as permitted by this Privacy Policy, the information will not be shared with other third parties. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Information Collected Through Technology.<br> We collect information through technology to make SHOP.COM more interesting and useful to you. For instance, when you come to one of the SHOP.COM sites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our customers visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information as more fully described in paragraph 1a. above.<br> <br>SHOP.COM also uses cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a site sends to your computer while you are viewing the site. SHOP.COM and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For instance, when you return to SHOP.COM after logging in, cookies provide information to the site so that the site will remember you. We may also use temporary or "session" cookies to help you shop. These cookies will expire when you place an order. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. To learn more about this technology visit &nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">NAI</a>. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your experience on SHOP.COM smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services will not function properly including the shopping cart and checkout areas. Some of our business partners may also use cookies on our site; however, we have no access to, or control over, these cookies and do not accept any responsibility for such use. <br><br> The SHOP.COM sites use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of sites. We may use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML emails that we send our customers to determine whether customers have opened those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable. <br><br> The SHOP.COM sites may include third party advertising and links to other web sites such as Google, advertising.com or shopping.com. These companies are called "network advertisers." We do not provide any personally identifiable information to these network advertisers. Network advertisers who place advertisements on our sites, or third parties with whom SHOP.COM has a relationship, may also use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information. You may not realize this information is being collected. In some cases, we may have access to information from web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our sites and this information may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser. Once you have clicked on an advertisement and have left our sites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their site. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.</p><p></p><div class="about_h2"><a name="use_and_share"></a>2. How We Use and Share the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Use by SHOP.COM.<br> SHOP.COM may use personally identifiable information for Operational Uses such as helping to establish and verify the identity of users; opening, maintaining, administering and servicing user accounts; processing, servicing or enforcing transactions and sending related service communications; providing services and support to users such as eGifts, Gift Certificates, Gift Registry, Bridal Registry, Reminders, rebates, contests, sweepstakes, and address books; improving the web site, including tailoring it to users' preferences; providing users with service or product updates, promotional notices and offers; responding to your questions, inquiries, comments and instructions; and maintaining the security and integrity of our systems. SHOP.COM may also use personally identifiable information to provide offers, promotions and product updates to you via standard mail. Your email address may be used by SHOP.COM or any subsidiary, parent or other coroporation into which SHOP.COM merges or is otherwise acquired or sold, in whole or in part. <br><br> SHOP.COM welcomes you to post reviews, comments, articles, stories and other appropriate content; send ecards and other communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information. Information or content submitted may be used by SHOP.COM or its affiliates to provide other consumers with product reviews and shopping information. If you do post content or submit material, and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant SHOP.COM a nonexclusive, fee-free, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media. You grant SHOP.COM the right to use the name or home town that you submit in connection with such content. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Use of Your Email Address Or Email Address You Provide to Us.<br> SHOP.COM may use your email address for processing, servicing or enforcing transactions and sending related service communications; providing users with service or product updates, promotional notices and offers; and/or responding to your questions, inquiries or comments. Your email address may be used by SHOP.COM or any subsidiary, parent or other corporation into which SHOP.COM merges or is otherwise acquired or sold, in whole or in part. </p><p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. SHOP.COM stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact &nbsp;<a href="mailto:customerservice@shop.com">Customer Service</a> to request that we remove this information from our database. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Use by Merchant Partners.<br> SHOP.COM and its Merchant Partners share information about you for Fulfillment Uses such as using your email address for shipping and other contact information for purposes of processing, servicing or enforcing transactions and sending order status and other related communications. You can contact each Merchant Partner by clicking on the "Stores" tab, then locating the particular Merchant Partner and finding contact information in the "Merchant Information" link. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Co-Branding Partners.<br> SHOP.COM has Co-Branding Partners that provide unique benefits to certain loyal customers. In Co-Branded Partnerships, SHOP.COM may acquire, share with its Co-Branding Partners or use personally identifiable information identified in paragraph 1.a., above, to communicate special offers, provide additional benefits or for other related uses. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Charitable Organizations.<br> SHOP.COM may offer opportunities for you to make purchases or donations to promote the charitable mission of certain organizations (such as Make-A-Wish Foundation). When you participate in these offers, your personally identifiable information may be forwarded to the charitable organization so that it may recognize your donation and provide follow up communication. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. Companies that Facilitate Communications and Transactions with You.<br> Sometimes SHOP.COM hires companies to help deliver messages or services, such as a company that helps fulfill prizes for a sweepstakes or assists us in the analysis of consumer data, development of new services, sending email, sending catalogs or other promotional mailings; or providing customer assistance or marketing assistance. In those instances, there is a need to share your information with these companies. Sometimes SHOP.COM also works with other companies who help either gather your information or communicate with you. Your opt-out choices under paragraph 3 below will not apply to sharing by SHOP.COM of your personal information with any of these companies. We require these third parties to maintain your information in strictest confidence and to ensure they honor the privacy settings you have selected for the handling of your private information. Nonetheless, except as separately permitted by other provisions of this Privacy Policy, these companies are allowed to gather, receive, and use your information only for the purposes described in this paragraph or as required by law. The personal identifiable information that may be shared is more fully described in paragraph 1a. above. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g. Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Sites, and Others.<br> Regardless of any opt-out choices that you make under paragraph 3, SHOP.COM will disclose personal information when it believes in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our sites, SHOP.COM, and/or third parties, including the safety and security of property that belongs to SHOP.COM or third parties. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h. No Sharing with Third-Party Marketers.<br> We do not rent to, or share your personal information with third-party marketers without first obtaining your consent. Should this policy change in the future, SHOP.COM will post a notification of those changes to the homepage and other places SHOP.COM deems appropriate.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Facebook Beacon <br>SHOP.COM is a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/beacon/faq.php">Facebook Beacon</a>-enabled site. Facebook Beacon allows you to easily share actions you take, such as making a purchase, on SHOP.COM through Facebook. When you make a purchase on SHOP.COM, we contact Facebook to determine whether you are logged-in to Facebook and whether your privacy preferences on Facebook indicate your wish to share the action on SHOP.COM with your Facebook friends and network members. If you are logged into Facebook at the same time you make a purchase on SHOP.COM and if your privacy preferences in your Facebook Profile indicate that you want to share that information, Facebook uses the action information sent by SHOP.COM in conjunction with Personally Identifiable Information Facebook already has about you (such as your Facebook Profile) and shares it with your Facebook friends and network members as permitted by the Facebook account. If you are not a Facebook user or logged into your Facebook account at the time you make the purchase on SHOP.COM, Facebook will discard the information SHOP.COM has sent to it. To learn more about Facebook Beacon, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/beacon/faq.php">click here</a>.<br><br>Facebook has recently created an FAQ page with a tutorial describing how the advertising system called Beacon works. The tutorial describes how users can either universally opt-out or, on a partner-by-partner basis opt-in, to allowing external website actions to appear in their newsfeed.<br><br>The tutorial can be found here: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/beacon/faq.php">http://www.facebook.com/beacon/faq.php</a> (requires users to be logged into their Facebook account).</p><p></p><div class="about_h2"><a name="choices_you_have"></a>3. Your choices about the collection, use and sharing of your personally identifiable information</div><p>With regard to personal information that you provide under this Privacy Policy, there are two separate opt-out choices available to you. These opt-out choices are the means by which you give us, or decline to give us, your consent to use your personal information for the purposes covered by these opt-out choices. There are several methods by which you can exercise your opt-out choices: (a) during the registration process on our sites; (b) after registration, by logging on our sites, clicking on our <a href="https://www.shop.com/ccn_account.shtml">My Account</a> link, <a href="https://www.shop.com/ccn_change_privacy.shtml">Privacy Policy</a> links or going to Manage My Account and following the opt-out directions; (c) by emailing, phoning or writing SHOP.COM using the contact information provided below; (d) promotional emails you receive from us will provide you with an "unsubscribe" option; and (e) at other times and locations on the site. Each of these opt-out choices is subject to the exceptions described further below. <br><br> Your two opt-out choices are: <br><br> SHOP.COM: You may choose to opt-out of receiving promotional materials from SHOP.COM, including the licensees, acquirers and Co-Branding Partners by de-selecting "Sign up to receive email announcements and take advantage of special savings from SHOP.COM." <br><br> SHOP.COM Merchant Partners: You may choose to opt-out of receiving promotional materials directly from SHOP.COM Merchant Partners by de-selecting "Make my email address available to stores that I order from today on SHOP.COM." <br><br> Please keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply in situations where (a) you either have made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for information from SHOP.COM, (b) SHOP.COM uses your personal information for either "Operational Uses" or "Fulfillment Uses" (as described above in paragraph 2), (c) SHOP.COM shares your personal information under the provisions of paragraph 2 above with respect to "Companies That Facilitate Communications and Transactions With You," or "Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Web Sites, SHOP.COM and Others." <br><br> Finally, if you do not exercise your opt-out choices upon registration or initial log-in at our sites, it may take up to ten (10) days for your opt-out choices to be fully effective. As our systems require time to update, promotional mailings using personal information shared before you opt-out may already be in process. Thus, you might continue to receive promotional materials from SHOP.COM based upon the personal information you have provided under this Privacy Policy for up to ten (10) days. For similar reasons, your personal information might continue to be shared with third parties for promotional purposes for up to ten (10) days.</p><p></p><div class="about_h2"><a name="security_measures"></a>4. SHOP.COM Security Measures to protect your personal information</div>The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access and improper use. On a regular basis, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your email address, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. <br><br> Whether you're ordering a catalog or making a purchase, we want you to feel safe and secure while visiting SHOP.COM. You can also feel confident making purchases from established Co-Branded Partner sites. To ensure that your credit card information is even more secure, we use secure sockets layer (SSL) software (which encrypts the information you input) when you give us your credit card information. We encrypt all credit card information and store it on a server that isn't accessible on the Internet. Once we store that information, it can not be displayed anywhere on SHOP.COM. Internally, SHOP.COM takes extra caution to limit access to customers' information. Only a few individuals within the company are given degrees of access to customers' personal information according to job function and necessity. Access is granted to these employees through special passwords. All employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure, guarded environment. If you have any questions about security on our web site, you can send an email to us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:customerservice@shop.com">customerservice@shop.com</a>.<p></p><div class="about_h2"><a name="how_can_you_access"></a>5. How can you access, update your information and opt out choices</div><p>You can access and update the contact information you gave us during registration (that is, your postal address, email address, or any other information that would directly enable us to contact you), or modify your opt-out choices, by going to <a href="https://www.shop.com/ccn_account.shtml">My Account</a>. You also have the ability to add new credit card or shipping information to My Account when placing an order. If you have elected to store your credit card information with us, we only display the last five digits of your credit card number in the saved payment methods in the My Account section. The full credit card information is stored on secure offline servers. For more information on how we protect your credit card information, see our Security section. <br><br> If you want to review, modify or correct any of this information, simply click on this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.shop.com/ccn_account.shtml">link</a>&nbsp;or go to the My Account center on our sites, and then log in with your member name and password. If you have forgotten your password, there are instructions on the link above to help you recover your password. If you need to recover your password, you can also contact us via email at &nbsp;<a href="mailto:customerservice@shop.com">customerservice@shop.com</a>. Please include information in the email that will help us identify your account so we can assist you with your request. We may also provide you an opportunity to update your contact information and/or modify your opt-out choices by sending you an email or other communication that invites your response. Finally, you may unsubscribe from certain email communications by clicking on unsubscribe links in those emails. <br><br> This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that SHOP.COM is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this site.</p><p></p><div class="about_h2">6. Other Information</div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Child Use.<br> SHOP.COM does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use SHOP.COM only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Legal Disclaimer.<br> We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our site. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Notification of Changes.<br> Our business changes constantly and our Privacy Policy will change accordingly. We may email periodic reminders of changes to our Privacy Policy, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers. <br><br> If we decide to change our email practices, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy statement, the homepage and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p><p></p><div class="about_h2"><a name="questions"></a>7.
