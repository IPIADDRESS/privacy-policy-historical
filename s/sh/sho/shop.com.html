<p>Your use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes. The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve the shopping experience at the Site.</p><p></p><div class="about_h2"><a name="types_of_personally"></a>1. Types of Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</div><p>While you visit the Site we collect various types of personally identifiable information (PII). Here are the types of information we gather: <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Information You Provide Us.<br> Much of the personally identifiable information we receive comes directly from customers who are interested in obtaining various products and services by shopping at the Site. Typically, this information includes your name, postal address, email address and telephone number. We may also collect other types of information such as gender, age, number of children, and personal interests, which we may associate with personally identifiable information. If you purchase products or services through the Site we will note, for example, credit card information, the type of services or products ordered or purchased, and the date of the order or purchase. We collect personal information when you register, log on, or visit the Site, including when you participate in activities on the Site, such as by placing an order, completing a user registration form or online survey, creating an address book, using our Shopping or Gift Services (including eGifts, Gift Certificates, Gift Registry, Bridal Registry, Reminder Service), or participating in a rebate offer, game, promotion, contest or sweepstakes. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Information From Others.<br> We are constantly improving the products and services we provide our customers. To aid in serving you better we may supplement personally identifiable information that we have collected directly from our customers with other information that we obtain from third parties or from our partner stores. In addition, we may obtain information about individuals who are not yet users of the Site. To ensure your privacy when we associate information that we obtain from third parties with personally identifiable information that we have collected under this Privacy Policy, we will treat the acquired information like the information that we collected ourselves. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Information Collected Through Technology.<br> We collect information through technology to make the Site more interesting and useful to you. For instance, when you come to the Site, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our customers visit various parts of the Site. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information as more fully described in paragraph 1a. above.<br> <br>We also use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a site sends to your computer while you are viewing the site. Cookies are used for a variety of purposes. For instance, when you return to the Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember you. We may also use temporary or "session" cookies to help you shop. These cookies will expire when you place an order. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your experience on the Site smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services will not function properly including the shopping cart and checkout areas. Some of our business partners may also use cookies on the Site; however, we have no access to, or control over, these cookies and do not accept any responsibility for such use. <br><br> The Site use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of web sites. We may use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on the Site, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of the Site. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML emails that we send our customers to determine whether customers have opened those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable. <br><br> The Site includes third party advertising and links to other web sites such as Google, advertising.com or shopping.com. These companies are called "network advertisers." We do not provide any personally identifiable information to these network advertisers. Network advertisers who place advertisements on the Site, or third parties with whom we have a relationship, may also use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information. You may not realize this information is being collected. In some cases, we may have access to information from web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on the Site and this information may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser. Once you have clicked on an advertisement and have left the Site, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their site. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.</p><p></p><div class="about_h2"><a name="use_and_share"></a>2.

If you order products from Alice.com they will receive your order information, name, address, telephone number, age and gender, as well as any other information necessary to properly fullfill your order. Their treatment of your Personal Information will be governed by the terms of their Privacy Statement, which we will always provide for your review during checkout, when an Alice.com product is in your cart. You can contact each Merchant Partner by clicking on the "Stores" tab, then locating the particular Merchant Partner and finding contact information in the "Store Info" link.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.

When you participate in these offers, your personally identifiable information may be forwarded to the charitable organization so that it may recognize your donation and provide follow up communication.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g. Affiliate, Parent and Subsidiary Companies.<br> In order to provide the best service to our customers, we may share your personally identifiable information and information about your spending habits with our Affiliate, Parent and Subsidiary companies, including without limitation, Market America Worldwide, Inc., Market America, Inc. and Marketamerica.com, Inc.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h. Companies that Facilitate Communications and Transactions with You.<br> Sometimes we hire companies to help deliver messages or services, such as a company that helps fulfill prizes for a sweepstakes or assists us in the analysis of consumer data, development of new services, sending email, credit card processing, sending catalogs or other promotional mailings; or providing customer assistance or marketing assistance. In those instances, there is a need to share your information with these companies. Sometimes we also work with other companies who help either gather your information or communicate with you. Your opt-out choices under paragraph 3 below will not apply to our sharing of your personal information with any of these companies. These third parties are required to maintain your information in strictest confidence and to ensure they honor the privacy settings you have selected for the handling of your private information. Nonetheless, except as separately permitted by other provisions of this Privacy Policy, these companies are allowed to gather, receive, and use your information only for the purposes described in this paragraph or as required by law. The personal identifiable information that may be shared is more fully described in paragraph 1a. above.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Sites, and Others.<br> Regardless of any opt-out choices that you make under paragraph 3, we will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our Site, SHOP MA, Inc., and/or third parties, including the safety and security of property that belongs to SHOP MA Inc. or third parties.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j. Third-Party Marketers.<br> We do not rent or sell your personal information with third-party marketers without first obtaining your consent. Should this policy change in the future, we will post a notification of those changes to the Site.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="about_h2"><a name="choices_you_have"></a>3. Your choices about the collection, use and sharing of your personally identifiable information</div><p>You may choose to opt-out (or decline to give us), your consent to use personally identifiable information for the purposes of receiving promotional materials from us, from our Merchant Partners, our Co-Branding Partners and/or our Affiliate, Parent and Subsidiary Companies. There are several methods by which you can exercise your opt-out choices: (a) during the registration process on our Site; (b) after registration, by logging on our Site, clicking on our <a href="https://www.shop.com/ccn%5Faccount.xhtml">My Account</a> link, <a href="https://www.shop.com/ccn%5Fchange%5Fprivacy.xhtml">Privacy Policy</a> links or going to My Account - Edit My Privacy Settings and following the opt-out directions; (c) by emailing or writing SHOP MA, Inc. using the contact information provided below; (d) promotional emails you receive from us will provide you with an "unsubscribe" option; and (e) at other times and locations on the Site. Each of these opt-out choices is subject to the exceptions described further below. <br><br>Please keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply in situations where (a) you either have made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for information from us, (b) we use your personal information for either "Operational Uses" or "Fulfillment Uses" (as described above in paragraph 2), (c) we share your personal information under the provisions of paragraph 2 above with respect to "Companies That Facilitate Communications and Transactions With You," "Independent Shop Consultants" or "Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Sites and Others." <br><br> Finally, if you do not exercise your opt-out choices upon registration or initial log-in at our Site, it may take up to ten (10) days for your opt-out choices to become effective. As our systems require time to update, promotional mailings using personal information shared before you opt-out may already be in process. Thus, you might continue to receive promotional materials from us based upon the personal information you have provided under this Privacy Policy for up to ten (10) days. For similar reasons, your personal information might continue to be shared with third parties for promotional purposes for up to ten (10) days.</p><p></p><div class="about_h2"><a name="security_measures"></a>4. Security Measures to protect your personal information</div>The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access and improper use. On a regular basis, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your email address, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. <br><br> Whether you're ordering a catalog or making a purchase, we want you to feel safe and secure while visiting the Site. You can also feel confident making purchases from established Co-Branded Partner sites. To ensure that your credit card information is even more secure, we use secure sockets layer (SSL) software (which encrypts the information you input) when you give us your credit card information. We encrypt all credit card information and store it on a server that isn't accessible on the Internet. Once we store that information, it can not be displayed anywhere on the Site. Internally, we take extra caution to limit access to customers' information. Only a few individuals within the company are given degrees of access to customers' personal information according to job function and necessity. Access is granted to these employees through special passwords. All employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. If you have any questions about security on the Site, you can send an email to us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:customerservice@shop.com">customerservice@shop.com</a>.<p></p><div class="about_h2"><a name="how_can_you_access"></a>5. How can you access, update your information and opt out choices</div><p>You can access and update the contact information you gave us during registration (that is, your postal address, email address, or any other information that would directly enable us to contact you), or modify your opt-out choices, by going to <a href="https://www.shop.com/ccn%5Faccount.xhtml">My Account</a>. You also have the ability to add new credit card or shipping information to My Account when placing an order. If you have elected to store your credit card information with us, we only display the last four digits of your credit card number in the saved payment methods in the My Account section. The full credit card information is stored on secure offline servers. For more information on how we protect your credit card information, see our Security section. <br><br> If you want to review, modify or correct any of this information, simply click on this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.shop.com/ccn%5Faccount.xhtml">link</a>&nbsp;or go to the My Account center on the Site, and then log in with your member name and password. If you have forgotten your password, there are instructions on the link above to help you recover your password. If you need to recover your password, you can also contact us via email at &nbsp;<a href="mailto:customerservice@shop.com">customerservice@shop.com</a>. Please include information in the email that will help us identify your account so we can assist you with your request. We may also provide you an opportunity to update your contact information and/or modify your opt-out choices by sending you an email or other communication that invites your response. Finally, you may unsubscribe from certain email communications by clicking on unsubscribe links in those emails. <br><br> This Site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site.</p><p></p><div class="about_h2"><a name="other"></a>6. Other Information</div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Child Use.<br> We do not knowingly collect personal information from, or sell products for purchase by, persons under the age of 18. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. Do not provide information to us, or purchase from this Site, if you are under the age of 18.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Legal Disclaimer.<br> We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our Site. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Notification of Changes.<br> Our business changes constantly and our Privacy Policy will change accordingly. You should check our Site frequently to recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. <br><br> If we decide to change our email practices, we will post those changes to the Site so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p><p></p><div class="about_h2"><a name="questions"></a>7.
