<p><strong>Why Do We Collect Personal Information?</strong><br>
Nasty Gal offers various products and services to our Customers and also strives to meet the needs of our Customers.&nbsp; We use your Personal Information for internal purposes such as tracking your order, analyzing your preferences, and noting trends and statistics.</p>
<p>To do this effectively, we need to collect certain Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>The Personal Information We Collect From You</strong><br>
All Personal Information we collect from you requires your consent, for example, opening an account, purchase and delivery of products, special offers, etc.&nbsp; We may request your consent from time to time to take part in improved product performance or for marketing purposes that we think will be useful to you.&nbsp; However, unless you are informed otherwise, the Personal Information we hold is for establishing and managing our business and customer relationship with you.&nbsp; Sensitive information is subject to greater restrictions and governed by law.</p>
<p>By communicating with Nasty Gal, including by email and by completing online forms, you are giving your consent to the collection of what Personal Information you provide.</p>
<p>You have the right to anonymity and do not have to supply us with information.&nbsp; However, if you choose not to provide the information and we need to fulfill your request for a specific product, we may be unable to provide you with that requested product.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping a Record of Personal Information</strong><br>
Depending on the product you have acquired, it may be necessary to keep a record of the transaction for business purposes or to enable us to respond to your concerns.</p>
<p>We may hold Personal Information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Internal      accounting and administration;</li>
	<li>To      supply you with information about your account including regular      statements;</li>
	<li>To      respond to inquiries;</li>
	<li>Enhancing      customer service, product options and to improve product performance;</li>
	<li>Promotions,      competition entry forms, redemption vouchers, and special offers where you      voluntarily supplied your personal details;</li>
	<li>To      administer sales records;</li>
	<li>To      provide information about us, our products, services and special offers;      and</li>
	<li>To      analyze our website usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occasionally we require organizations outside Nasty Gal to provide a service for purposes, which are necessary for us to conduct our business, functions and activities (for example advertising names of competition winners and delivering products).&nbsp; We take all steps to ensure these organizations both inside and outside of the United States deal with Personal Information according to this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Our Disclosure of Your Information/Security</strong><br>

</ul>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><strong>Cookies</strong>.
