</div>
<p>	3.

<p>	When you visit a MBI website(s), MBI uses “cookie” technology try to make that experience simple, personalised and meaningful.

<p>	MBI use cookies to:</p>

<p>	•	recognise when a visitor to a MBI website has visited before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive to the website and allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get; <br>
•	customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the website; </p>
<p>	•	store your product selections to the shopping basket; <br>
•	collect statistical information about how our visitors use the website(s) so that we can improve the website(s) and learn which parts are most popular to visitors; and </p>
<p>	•	Gather information through our advertising partners, about the pages on the MBI website(s) that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in an “interest segment”. This information is then used to serve interest-based advertisements which it is believed will be targeted to your interests. For more information about this type of interest based advertising, and about how to turn this feature off please visit www.youronlinechoices.co.uk or follow the link to the website of our advertising partners shown below.

Some of the cookies used by MBI websites are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf.
