                    This privacy policy covers the collection and use of personal information collected for the
                    websites,
                    www.shopforyourcause.com and all URL"s which are owned by the parent company (Shop for your Cause,
                    LLC incorporated in Arlington, VA)
                    and directly mapped to this site: these include www.shopforyourrescue.com,
                    www.shopforyourchurch.com, and www.shopfortheland.com. This
                    privacy statement discloses the types of information we collect and how we use it.

                    <strong>What information is collected.</strong><br>
                    We take the privacy of users of this website very seriously. Because we gather certain pieces of
                    your personal information, we want to help
                    you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and ultimate use of that
                    information. Shop for your Cause, LLC gives users
                    the opportunity to contribute a percentage (in rare cases a flat-fee) of their online purchases to
                    participating schools, churches, and nonprofit
                    organizations. While registration is not necessary, if the user chooses to register, they must
                    provide us with their Name, e-mail address, zip code,
                    and a password so you may log back into the site. Cookies, Local Shared Objects on Our Site and
                    Digital Finger printing Cookies. Shop for your Cause
                    uses cookies to provide you with a more customized experience and ensure that the donations arising
                    from your shopping and other activities online are
                    credited to the intended organizations. A cookie, or Local Shared Object (Flash Cookie) is a small
                    text file that is stored on a user's computer for
                    record-keeping purposes. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information, but do
                    contain a unique user ID and may contain IDs for the Causes
                    you have selected to support through the Site. If you choose to register, the user ID is linked to
                    your account, allowing you to track your donations.
                    Depending on participating merchant policies, tracking cookies are set when you visit our site, when
                    you visit a merchant site, or when you click on the link
                    provided by the Shop for your Cause Software. We set cookies to store your user name (if provided),
                    your favorite Cause and other information so you don't have
                    to enter this information every time you visit our Site. We also use cookies for non-registered
                    users to track them based on an anonymous user ID. Cookies also
                    enable us to track users sessions on the Site, such as features that you use, actions that you take,
                    and the information you access. We use this information to
                    target the interests of our users and enhance their experience on the Site. Similarly, we use this
                    information in statistical and aggregate formats to assess the
                    effectiveness of our Site and to better understand your priorities and interests. The Shop for your
                    Cause Software collects and transmits back to our servers certain
                    information that is not personally identifiable such as which Internet browser you are using, which
                    version of our software you downloaded, your software application
                    preferences and whether you have certain features enabled or disabled. In addition, the Shop for
                    your Cause Software transmits information to us to let us know when
                    you visit the website of a Merchant and when you make a purchase from that Merchant to help us
                    ensure the Cause that you have chosen receives the applicable donation
                    for your purchase. Shop for your Cause Software may collect and transmit to Shop for your Cause
                    information about the web sites you visit and your activities on those
                    web sites, which may include the purchases you make (or decide to abandon), searches you perform,
                    ads you see or click through, videos you watch, and/or non-personally
                    identifiable, data you submit into web forms on web sites. Generally, all of this information is
                    collected and transmitted on an anonymous basis, using an anonymous
                    user ID, and is not associated with your name, email address or other personally identifiable
                    information. However, you should be aware that if you submit
                    personally identifiable information into web forms, this information may be transmitted back to Shop
                    for your Cause. However, we will not use such personally
                    identifiable information for marketing purposes nor intentionally associate it with non personally
                    identifiable information about you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What information is NOT collected.</strong><br>
                    We do not collect credit card info, social security number, or software or hardware
                    attributes/information. We only collect the information that you voluntarily
                    share with us. Credit card information is handled by the merchant who you are shopping through. We
                    simply act as a portal and never see nor have any access to your
                    credit card information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How We Keep Your Information Secure</strong><br>
                    The security of your personal information is of vital importance to us. At Shop for your Cause, our
                    security measures consist of firewalls, regular internal audits,
                    password protections and vulnerability scans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any sensitive information that we may have access to, such as order transaction information needed
                    to be able to
                    make payments to your cause (this is contained in third party reporting and is secured using their
                    own security devices).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Your Privacy with Shop for your Cause</strong><br>
                    Shop for your Cause will never ask for any of your personal log-in information via an unsolicited
                    phone call, e-mail, or written letter. The only time there is
                    communication about these pieces of information is when you as the user proactively communicate with
                    Shop for your Cause inquiring about this information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Member Communication</strong><br>
                    Shopping via Shop for your Cause has more perks than just getting to donate a percentage of the
                    purchase to your charity. We work tirelessly to give you the best
                    deals and coupons for your favorite stores. We will e-mail you with these special offers as well as
                    other important information about the charities you shop for.
                    You may unsubscribe from these mailings anytime you like within the respective e-mails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Communication with non-profits</strong><br>
                    At times and for certain charities we will share information so they can analyze and have a better
                    idea of what is going on within their membership base.
                    This will only consist of a certain set parameter of your e-mail address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Privacy Policy Terms of Agreement</strong><br>
                    By using the Shop for your Cause website, you consent to the policies and practices described in
                    this privacy policy and agree to have your personal information
                    collected by Shop for your Cause (or its agents or contractors) and transferred to and processed in
