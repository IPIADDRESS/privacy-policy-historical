                    you need to register for our service and become a Member of

                    at anytime. Our registration form requires Members to give 
                    us basic contact information (such as your name, mailing and 
                    e-mail address) and some demographic information (such as 
                    your zip code, age and gender). The registration form information 
                    requests may change from time to time. Although additional 
                    demographic information may be requested at the time of registration, 
                    only information marked "required" is necessary

                  <p><b>Information Collected Via the Member's Use of the Site</b><br>

                  <p><b>Cookies</b><br>
                    We use "cookies" for the narrow purpose of facilitating 
                    our Automatic Log-in process. A "cookie" is a small 
                    packet of information that your web browser places on your 
                    computer's hard drive. We use them to store your Automatic

                    <b>Image Beacons</b><br>
                    We use electronic images (called "image beacons", 
                    "single-pixel GIFs", or "action tags") 
                    that allow us to count users who have visited a certain Web 
                    page or opened an e-mail, conduct research on partner and 
                    Client Web sites for auditing purposes, or to access your 
                    ShopCartUSA "cookie." Using image beacons allows 
                    us to personalize your experience by tailoring advertisements, 
                    updates, and other offers to your particular interests, and 
                    measuring the marketing effectiveness of our e-mail communications. 
                    <br>
                    Information recorded through these image beacons may be used 
                    to report aggregate demographic or usage information about 
                    Members to our Clients, or user-level usage information to 
                    our Third Party Processors. No personally identifiable information 
                    about you is shared with a Client or Third Party Processors 
                    except as otherwise set forth in this policy.</p>

                    At some point during the course of your membership we may

                    Like many Web sites on the Internet, ShopCartUSA links to

                    takes you to another Web site, you are subject to the privacy

                    Other Web sites and Your Privacy</p>
                  <p>ShopCartUSA contains links to other Web sites. Please note 
                    that these other Web sites may have privacy policies that 
                    differ from those of ShopCartUSA. Several of these other Web 
                    sites may share or otherwise use the personal information 
                    you provide them. We have no control over any personal information

                  <p><b>Clients<br>
                    </b>Except as provided above, your information is shared with 
                    Clients only on an aggregate (non-personally identifiable)

                    the opportunity to share some of your contact information 
                    with Clients, who subject such information to their own privacy 
                    policies. For example, you may wish to receive more information 
                    directly from a Client via e-mail or postal service, and you 
                    can use reply forms at various points on ShopCartUSA to communicate 
                    that information to a Client. But it is strictly your decision

                  <p><b>Third Party Processors<br>

                    to organize, administer, process, append and/or analyze our

                    offers to you and to eliminate the delivery of duplicate offers 
                    from a Client(s). We may use Third Party Processors to deliver 
                    offline materials to you. We may also use Third Party Processors

                    of your information. We disclaim and you agree that we will 
                    not be liable to you for any damages caused by acts or events 
                    beyond the reasonable control of a Third Party Processor including, 
                    without limitation, acts of God, fires, floods, acts of terrorism, 
                    wars, civil disturbances, sabotage, accidents, labor disputes,
