Privacy Statement for Hollywood.com</h2><p></p>
</center>

<input type="hidden" value="4" name="page">
        Hollywood.com, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate 
        our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information 
        gathering and dissemination practices for this website: Hollywood.com. 
        <p></p><p>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, 
and to administer our Website.  Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin.
</p><p>
Our site uses cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.  We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password and zip code so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.
</p><p>
Through surveys and newsletter registration, our site may request users to give us contact, demographic, and/or financial information (such as their name, locale, gender, age, income level and email address). The demographic information is used to enhance user experience so we can be more content specific. The contact information is used to notify users of new content, for surveys and newsletters, via email.  Financial information that is collected is used primarily for in-house statistics, advertising, and marketing target information.  ShowTimes Direct collects the user's zip code to provide specific theatre show times in their area.  Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.
</p><p>
We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their name and email address) and demographic information (such as their zip code, age, and/or income level).  The user's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary, such as if they win a contest or to notify users of upcoming contests.  There are three primary types of contests: (1.) We host solely and all information that is collected stays in-house. (2.) We may share address information with third party for shipping purposes. (3.) In some rare instances, a third party may host the contest and all information is then shared.  In our contest registration, we give our users the opportunity to sign up for the Hollywood.com newsletter.  However, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by selecting the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the newsletter.
</p><p>
This site contains links to other sites.  <b>Hollywood.com</b> is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
</p><p>
We have a "Powered by" relationship with Gist.  Their content is housed on their servers. We link to Gist for movies on television as a banner and promotional swap.  We share general aggregate information about our users with advertisers and business development partners.
</p><p>
We use advertising software to service the ads on our site.  These ads may contain cookies.  While we use cookies in other parts of our Website, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad servers generated through advertising software and we do access this information. We may serve third party advertising which may also contain cookies but we do not have access to this information.
</p><p>
</p><h2>Public Forums</h2>
        This site contains message boards, and/or news groups available to its users.  We request users to give us contact information, such as name, email, address, occupation, and interests to be a registered bulletin board user.  This information is optional and not necessary to post messages. This information may be used by the administrator to send the user email notices. However, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.  Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information.
<p></p><p>
</p><h2>Security</h2>
        This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.  We use Secure Shell to access our servers remotely, and all server sessions are encrypted.  We protect the secure areas of our site (including our databases and intranet) by using a Gauntlet firewall.
<p>
</p><h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor.
