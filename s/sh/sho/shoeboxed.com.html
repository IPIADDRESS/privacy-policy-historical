<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated: October 19, 2007</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>
	shoeboxed, Inc. was conceived, in part, as a way to increase consumer confidence in the Internet, so it's no surprise that we take privacy very seriously. By visiting our site and using our services, you are accepting the practices and guidelines set out in this document (henceforth referred to as the 'Policy'), so please take a few minutes to read it over carefully.
</p>
<p>
	The Policy will address how shoeboxed (referring to shoeboxed, Inc. and all its services and products; also refers to 'us,' 'we,' and 'Company' in this Policy) uses and stores the data gathered when you (the 'User') use its website.
</p>
<p>
	The Policy does not apply to or bind third parties that shoeboxed does not control or to individuals that have special permission from shoeboxed to break it.
</p>
<h2>WHAT SHOEBOXED COLLECTS</h2>
<p>
	Collecting personal information allows shoeboxed to offer a more customized, secure, and efficient service to users. To that end, we only collect personal information that is relevant to the purposes of the Company.
</p>
<p>
	We collect the following information from our users:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Registration information</li>

	<li>Passive information</li>
	<li>Traffic data</li>
</ul>

<p>

Your data may be shared with other users if you choose to allow it. You may allow it by utilizing the "shared shoebox" feature. Any content in your shared shoebox may be shared with other users, and may be attributed to your personal identity, as you have so indicated in the registration process.
</p>
<p>
	Registration is required if you want to use many of the services of shoeboxed. As part of this registration, shoeboxed will require that you submit certain information, such as your e-mail address.
</p>
<p>
	Any and all information submitted to shoeboxed as feedback may be gathered and processed by shoeboxed to improve its software and website. shoeboxed may use anonymous information gathered through feedback for marketing purposes. shoeboxed will not use feedback information that identifies you specifically without your permission.
</p>
<p>
	We gather and store certain types of information whenever you use shoeboxed products or services. shoeboxed records traffic data from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the pages you are visiting within the site. Traffic data is helpful in identifying and fixing problems with the site.
</p>
<p>
	shoeboxed may display on any page within the site how many times that page has been viewed.
</p>
<p>
	Programs are available that can help you visit websites anonymously, but using such a program may make shoeboxed unable to provide a personalized experience for you when you use its services.
</p>
<p>
	Passive information is automatically generated. shoeboxed will only use this information on an aggregated level for software and website improvement or for statistical information.
</p>
<p>
	shoeboxed uses cookies to enable the site to recognize your browser and relay traffic data back to our servers. shoeboxed cookies do not collect personal information, and information from cookies is not combined with other personal information to identify specific users' browsing frequency or actions.
</p>
<p>
	You are strongly encouraged to keep your cookie settings enabled, because they allow you to fully experience many of shoeboxed's features.
</p>
<p>
	Some of shoeboxed's partners, especially site analyzers, use cookies on shoeboxed.com, but we do not use, access or control those cookies or their uses.
</p>
<p>
	The information users provide to shoeboxed is integral to the functioning of the website. We will not rent or sell your personal information to anyone. We share such data only in certain circumstances, as listed below:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		shoeboxed employees, consultants and contracted workers may use or come into contact with user information during the course of their normal working duties for shoeboxed.
	</li>
	<li>
		shoeboxed will release personal user information if it is required under the law or the Terms of Service, or is otherwise necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of shoeboxed, its employees, users or others.
	</li>
	<li>
		If shoeboxed ever tries to share your personal information except as set forth above, it will contact you and you may prevent shoeboxed from sharing this data by opting out.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>
	Your personal data on shoeboxed is protected by a user name and password login. You are responsible for keeping your user name and password secret, and should be careful to log out of your account after you have finished any given session, especially if you are using a public computer.
</p>
<p>
	Only employees that need to access personal information (such as customer service representatives) will have access to personal information. shoeboxed keeps all employees informed and reminded of privacy and security practices.
</p>
<h2>CHOICES ABOUT MY PRIVACY</h2>
<p>
	You may always opt not to disclose certain personal information, but that may mean that you will not be able to access certain services.
</p>
<p>
	You may request that your account be deleted from shoeboxed by sending an e-mail to help@team.shoeboxed.com.
</p>
<p>
	You can add, delete or update your personal information, but shoeboxed may retain a copy of the unrevised information.
</p>
<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
