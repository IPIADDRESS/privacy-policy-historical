<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated: August 14, 2019</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Shoeboxed Inc. was conceived, in part, as a way to increase consumer confidence in the Internet, so it’s no surprise that we take privacy very seriously. By visiting our site and using our services, you are accepting the practices and guidelines set out in this document (henceforth referred to as the ‘Policy’), so please take a few minutes to read it over carefully.</p>
<p>The Policy will address how Shoeboxed (referring to Shoeboxed Inc. and all its services and products; also refers to ‘us,’ ‘we,’ and ‘Company’ in this Policy) uses and stores the data gathered when you (the ‘User’) use its website.</p>
<p>The Policy does not apply to or bind third parties that Shoeboxed does not control.</p>
<p>We collect the following information from our users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration information (first and last name, username, password and email address)</li>
<li>Mail-In Registration Information (mailing address and phone number, in addition to credit card information, which is processed by a secure third-party credit card processing service)</li>
<li>User-submitted receipts, business cards, and other documents</li>
<li>Email receipts synced via Gmail Receipt Sync (for users who have approved access to their email data through the Gmail API)</li>
<li>Data about personal items in text and picture form</li>
<li>All other user-generated content entered in the normal course of using the Services, including but not limited to forum posts, profiles, comments, suggestions, forwarded messages, etc.</li>
<li>Feedback information</li>
<li>Passive information</li>
<li>Traffic data</li>
<li>Banking and financial information (processed by a secure third-party payment network)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your information in your Shoeboxed account</h3>
<p>Shoeboxed may use the information listed above to: enforce our Terms of Service, customize and improve Shoeboxed’s software and website, provide customer service, resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems, provide service updates and promotional offers unless you opt out and verify your identity. You can opt out of these messages by clicking Manage your subscription at the bottom of your emails and/or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:help@team.shoeboxed.com">help@team.shoeboxed.com</a>.</p>
<p>Registration information: Registration is required if you want to use many of the services of Shoeboxed. As part of this registration, Shoeboxed will require that you submit certain information, such as your email address. Any and all information submitted to Shoeboxed as feedback may be gathered and processed by Shoeboxed to improve its software and website. Shoeboxed may use anonymous information gathered through feedback for marketing purposes. Shoeboxed will not use feedback information that identifies you specifically without your permission.</p>
<p>Email receipt data: For users who have opted in to Gmail Receipt Sync and approved access to email data through the Gmail API, Shoeboxed workers may come in contact with emails synced from an authorized Gmail account only after they have been synced to the corresponding Shoeboxed account and only for the purpose of fulfilling their work duties such as resolving disputes or providing customer service. Shoeboxed workers do not have direct access to users’ Gmail accounts, nor to any emails not synced to Shoeboxed. User emails that were not identified as receipts are not stored anywhere in our system and are not used for any purpose.</p>
<p>Traffic data: We gather and store certain types of information whenever you use Shoeboxed products or services. Shoeboxed records traffic data from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the pages you are visiting within the site, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. Traffic data is helpful in identifying and fixing problems with the site. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you to improve the services we offer you, improve user analytics, or site functionality.</p>
<p>Tracking Technologies: We Shoeboxed and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or customer support service providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.</p>
<p>We use cookies to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference). Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some features or areas of our website may be limited.</p>
<p>We use Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.</p>
<p>Shoeboxed may display on any page within the site how many times that page has been viewed.</p>
<p>Programs are available that can help you visit websites anonymously, but using such a program may make Shoeboxed unable to provide a personalized experience for you when using its services.</p>
<p>Passive information is automatically generated. Shoeboxed will only use this information on an aggregated level for software and website improvement or for statistical information.</p>
<p>Mail-In Registration Information: Shoeboxed uses credit card processors to provide our Receipt Mail-In service. When you sign up for Receipt Mail-In, your name and payment and mailing information will be sent as necessary to these processors to provide the service. These processors are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose than processing your payment of Receipt Mail-In as directed by Shoeboxed.</p>
<p>We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
<p>The information users provide to Shoeboxed is integral to the functioning of the website. We share such data with third parties only in certain circumstances, as listed below:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>Shoeboxed employees, consultants and contracted workers may use or come into contact with user information during the course of their normal working duties for Shoeboxed. These workers are prohibited from using the user information for any other purpose other than delivering services, resolving disputes or providing customer service.</li>
<li>In certain situations, Shoeboxed may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Shoeboxed will release personal user information if it is required under the law or the Terms of Service, or is otherwise necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Shoeboxed, its employees, users or others. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our site.</li>
<li>If Shoeboxed ever tries to share your personal information except as set forth above, it will contact you and you may prevent Shoeboxed from sharing this data by opting out.</li>
<li>If Shoeboxed Inc. is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h3>How your information is secured</h3>
<p>Your personal data on Shoeboxed is protected by a user name and password login. You are responsible for keeping your user name and password secret, and should be careful to log out of your account after you have finished any given session, especially if you are using a public computer. The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as your name, mailing address, or credit card information) on our registration forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>Only employees that need to access personal information (such as customer service representatives) will have access to personal information. Shoeboxed keeps all employees informed and reminded of privacy and security practices.</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:help@team.shoeboxed.com">help@team.shoeboxed.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Your choices about your privacy</h3>
<p>Upon request, Shoeboxed Inc. will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may always opt not to disclose certain personal information, but that may mean that you will not be able to access certain services. For example, your name and email address are necessary to complete the registration process. After registration, you can always opt out of receiving non-service related messages by clicking manage your subscription at the bottom of these messages or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:help@team.shoeboxed.com">help@team.shoeboxed.com</a>. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>You will receive an automatic welcome email necessary to complete your registration process. You may also receive service-related announcements on rare occasions, for example, if our service is temporarily suspended. If you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option of deactivating your account. You may request that your account be deleted or deactivated from Shoeboxed by sending an email to <a href="mailto:help@team.shoeboxed.com">help@team.shoeboxed.com</a>.</p>
<p>You can add, delete or update your personal information, but Shoeboxed may retain a copy of the unrevised information. You can also add, delete or update your personal information by clicking on Account Settings upon logging in. Contact us at <a href="mailto:help@team.shoeboxed.com">help@team.shoeboxed.com</a> with any questions. You can unsubscribe from any of the non-service related Shoeboxed messages or newsletters by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of your emailed newsletters. If you choose to use our Invite Friends feature, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:help@team.shoeboxed.com">help@team.shoeboxed.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p>Shoeboxed does not post any user information along with testimonials unless we have been given permission to do so by the user. We get in touch with our users to verify that they are aware of their personal information being posted on our public site before anything is posted. The user may submit or revoke a testimonial by contacting us at <a href="mailto:help@team.shoeboxed.com">help@team.shoeboxed.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose to submit any personal information on our blog, you should be aware that this information can be read, collected, or used by other users on these forums. We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these forums. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:help@team.shoeboxed.com">help@team.shoeboxed.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Alternatively, if you used a third party application to post such information, you can remove it, by either logging into the said application and removing the information or by contacting the appropriate third party application.</p>
<p>If you have a concern about Shoeboxed’s privacy policy, please send it via email to <a href="help@team.shoeboxed.com">help@team.shoeboxed.com</a> or mail it to 122 E Houston St, San Antonio, TX 78205.
