<p>The Policy will address how Shoeboxed (referring to Shoeboxed, Inc. and all its services and products; also refers to ‘us,’ ‘we,’ and ‘Company’ in this Policy) uses and stores the data gathered when you (the ‘User’) use its website.</p>
<p>The Policy does not apply to or bind third parties that Shoeboxed does not control.</p>
<p>We collect the following information from our users:</p>
<ul><li>Registration information (first and last name, username, password and email address)</li><li>Mail-In Registration Information (mailing address and phone number, in addition to credit card information, which is processed by a secure third-party credit card processing service)</li><li>User receipts</li><li>User e-mails from retailers</li><li>User business cards</li><li>Data about personal items in text and picture form.</li><li>All other user-generated content entered in the normal course of using the Services, including but not limited to forum posts, profiles, comments, suggestions, forwarded messages, etc.</li><li>Feedback information</li><li>Passive information</li><li>Traffic data</li><li>Banking and financial information (processed by a secure third-party payment network)</li></ul>
<h2>Your information in your Shoeboxed account</h2>

<p>Shoeboxed may display on any page within the site how many times that page has been viewed.</p>
<p>Programs are available that can help you visit websites anonymously, but using such a program may make Shoeboxed unable to provide a personalized experience for you when you use its services.</p>
