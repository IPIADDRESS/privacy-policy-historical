<p>This Privacy Policy covers the use of the website <a href="http://www.shopperreports.com/" target="_blank">www.shopperreports.com</a> and the
ShopperReports software and comparative service (collectively:

</span></span><span>When you visit a shopping or travel website, the
ShopperReports software connects to our servers to check for product and travel
information, better prices and alternative offers for the product or travel
deal you were interested in, in order to present them to you. For that end, the
software transmits to our servers only the URL of the e-commerce or travel site
you are visiting or the search term you typed in search engines.</span></p>

<p style="background:white"><u>(a) Anonymous Aggregate
Information</u></p>

<p style="background:white">ShopperReports collects and stores
aggregated anonymous information about the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e-commerce or travel web pages
its users view and the data they enter in search engine search fields while using
the ShopperReports software (the “Service”). &nbsp;ShopperReports uses this
information to determine which alternative offers to display on your browser
window pane. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="background:white">The ShopperReports software does <b>not</b>
send to our servers any information about the web pages you view, unless you
are visiting one of the e-commerce or travel sites that we have examined and
catalogued. For every such e-commerce or travel web page you view while using
the Service, the ShopperReports software transmits from your computer to the ShopperReports
server and stores the following information: your Internet Protocol (IP)
Address; the Full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the web page you are
visiting; general information about your browser and your computer's operating
system; your ShopperReports cookie number and the date and time the above
information is logged.&nbsp; We also collect and store the following ShopperReports
usage statistics: what is clicked on the browser window pane; the amount of
time the Service is used during each session; which keyword searches are
performed and what alternative results are received during any given session.</p>

<p style="background:white">If you are only visiting our site (<a href="http://www.ShopperReports.com/" target="_blank">www.ShopperReports.com</a>), we collect the
following information: the URL of the web page from which you came; the date
and time of each page you view; the name of and information about any
advertisement that brought you to our web site; and computer and connection
information.&nbsp; If the URL of the page from which you came contains any PII about
you, we will not attempt to determine your identity by analyzing the URL in any
way. Also the IP address of the computer from which you arrived to our site is
recorded by the web server; this is an automated information collection as done
by any web server, and we do not store this information for further use. </p>

<p style="background:white"><u>(b) Personally Identifiable
Information</u></p>

<p style="background:white">Currently there is no personal
registration on our site. In the future we may add services that can ask for your
registration.&nbsp; In these cases, Registration will be optional and you may choose
to use the ShopperReports program without revealing any personally identifiable
information about yourself.&nbsp; If you choose to register, ShopperReports will ask
you for some PII (for example your name, email address, and a city or an
airport near you) in order to create an account.&nbsp; </p>

<p style="background:white">If you contact us through the
"Partner with us" or "contact us" pages, you are required
to provide your e-mail address and, optionally, name and phone number, so that
we may be able to respond to your inquiry.&nbsp; In any event, this PII is not used
in any manner other than to contact you regarding your inquiry. </p>

<p style="background:white">Any PII which would be gathered, as
described above, is stored separately from the information about the web pages
you view and the data you enter in search engine search fields and the two
types of information are not correlated or linked. </p>

<p style="background:white">Except for the specific cases
described above, we do not gather PII from you without your specific permission
when you visit the ShopperReports site and download the ShopperReports software
