        <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

            <div>Reason Software Company Inc., collectively referred to as "ShouldIRemove.com, ShouldIRemoveIt.com, Reason or Reason Software", understands the importance of protecting personal information. This privacy policy outlines how Reason Software Company collects, uses, and discloses your personal information. The following principles apply to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address or email address.</div>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">What information does Reason Software Company collect and how is it used?</h3>
                <div>Reason Software Company gathers personal information in order to provide the award-winning products, service, and support you’ve come to expect from us. As with most transactions, personal information is required in order to set up your account and complete your purchase. But it also helps us provide the product and support information we believe is of greatest interest to you.</div>
                <div style="margin-top: 15px;">There are a variety of situations in which Reason Software Company may collect personal information, such as when you register as a customer; purchase one of our products; download free evaluation software, upgrades or software purchases. In each of those situations, Reason Software Company only collects the personal information required to meet your needs. Depending on the circumstances, we may ask for your name, company name, billing or shipping address, credit card information, email address, phone number, or other pertinent information.</div>
                <div style="margin-top: 15px;">Reason Software Company uses your information to better understand your needs, provide you with the services you have requested, and with a view to provide you with better service. We may use your information to help you complete a transaction, (including fulfillment of orders and promotional offers), to communicate back to you, to inform you of and update you on services and benefits, and to manage and renew your subscription(s). Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing, maintenance of your subscription, and fraud protection and are not used for other purposes without your permission. Reason Software Company will keep your personal information for as long as you are a registered subscriber or user of our product(s) and thereafter, for no longer than is reasonably necessary for internal reporting and reconciliation purposes and to provide you with any feedback or information that you might request or require.</div>


                <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Does Reason Software Company disclose personal information?</h3>
                <div>In limited circumstances, Reason Software Company may need to share your information in order to meet your particular needs. Reason Software Company has a number of relationships with vendors with whom we may share your personal information for the purpose of providing a service, fulfilling an order, or meeting your other needs. For example, we use selected vendors for the purpose of providing credit card transaction processing services. These vendors verify your purchase information, such as credit card number, and authorize your transaction. In doing so, the vendors have access to limited information about users, but they are prohibited from using the information for any other purpose. Reason Software Company imposes strict confidentiality obligations on all third-party vendors with whom we share your information. By providing your information to us, you are deemed to consent to the transfer of your information to Reasons’s third-party vendors in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</div>
                <div style="margin-top: 15px;">We may also need to share your personal information with other legal entities within Reason Software. All such entities adhere to the Reason Software Company Privacy Policy. From time to time, Reason Software Company may provide personal information to law enforcement authorities or other third parties in response to a subpoena, an official inquiry, or as may be required in the case of national security. Reason Software Company will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own marketing purposes.</div>


                <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">How does Reason Software Company secure personal information?</h3>
                <div>Reason Software Company uses state-of-the-art security technology to protect our customer data. Access to customer information is restricted to authorized personnel only. Our website is regularly tested for security vulnerabilities to ensure all collected information is secure from unauthorized viewing. Personal customer information is protected in transit via HTTPS and SSL security. Credit card information is transmitted with multiple layers of security, including encryption in storage and SSL in transit. For more information, please review the section on disclosure of information above.</div>
                <div style="margin-top: 15px;">Reason Software Company complies with PCI Data Security Standards that require merchants to implement strong security measures to protect our customers’ credit card information.</div>


                <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Does Reason Software Company keep track of website visitor data?</h3>
                <div>Like many other companies, Reason Software Company uses “cookies” to remember user preferences and maximize performance of our website and services. Additionally, cookies help us to identify returning users so, for example, we don’t need to ask them to enter their email and password on every visit. Any personal information we collect with cookies is not shared with any outside parties.</div>
                <div style="margin-top: 15px;">Please note the information gathered by cookies is necessary to provide certain subscription services. We cannot provide those services to users who do not give their consent to the data processing carried out through cookies or whose browsers are set to reject all cookies.</div>
                <div style="margin-top: 15px;">As is common on the Internet, Reason Software Company maintains log files of the traffic that visits our sites. For example, our servers may automatically record the information you or your browser send when you visit a website. These log files may include information such as your requests, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your system.</div>


                <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Does Reason Software Company comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act?</h3>
                <div>Yes. Reason Software Company complies with all the regulations of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of the United States of America. Reason Software Company does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn we have collected personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems.</div>


                <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Additional information for users in the European Economic Area</h3>
                <div>Our customers’ personal information is stored on our servers currently located in the United States. The location of our servers may be subject to change. In addition, Reason Software Company may transfer your personal information to our vendors outside of the EEA, as described in this privacy policy. At present, the laws of the United States and other countries outside the EEA (except for Argentina, Canada, Isle of Man, Guernsey, and Switzerland) have not been approved by the European Commission as providing “adequate protection” for personal information within the meaning of the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC).</div>
                <div style="margin-top: 15px;">Reason Software Company imposes strict requirements on our vendors outside of the EEA regarding the use and protection of our customers’ personal information. In addition, with regard to our consumer customers, Reason Software Company abides by the Safe Harbor Framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected from the European Union.</div>
                <div style="margin-top: 15px;">By purchasing or using our products from a country in the EEA and submitting your personal information to us, we deem that you are consenting to the processing of your personal information in the United States or other country outside of the EEA.</div>


                <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">How often does Reason Software Company update its privacy policy?</h3>
                <div>We may update this policy at any time by posting additions or modifications on this web page. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email or via a prominent notice on our website and where necessary we will seek the prior consent of our users.</div>


                <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Contact us</h3>
                <div>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you should first contact the Privacy Program Office of Reason Software Company Inc. by emailing privacy@builtwithreason.com, by calling (646) 664-1038, or by sending a letter to Reason Software Company Inc., 228 Park Ave S #74122, New York, NY 10003-1502.</div>
