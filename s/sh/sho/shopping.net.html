    <p class="mt15">
        Thank you for visiting Shopping.net, a production of IAC Search &amp; Media, Inc. ("IAC Search &amp; Media", "we", "us" or "our"). We respect your privacy, and we
        understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning the information collected through
        our website (whether existing now or in the future, collectively, the “Services”). Below we describe what information we collect when you use the Services,
        how we protect that information, with whom we share it, and what your privacy options are. By using the Services, you consent to our collection and use
        of your data as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p class="mt15">
        This Privacy Policy only applies to properties we own and operate. Our properties may provide links to third party websites and this Privacy Policy will
        not apply to any information you may provide while on such third party websites. We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies,
        business practices, and our users’ needs, and may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly. Please check this page periodically for updates.
        If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here, along with its effective date, and notify
        you by means of a notice on our website.</p>

    <h4>1. Information we collect</h4>
    <p>
        We explain the two ways that we collect and process information about you.
    </p>
    <h6>A. Information You Provide to Us</h6>
    <p class="mt15"><strong>a. Sale alerts and Wish List:</strong> You may choose to set up Sale Alerts and add items to your Wish List.
        We will not share your Wish List items with others, and we will only use your name and/or email address for the purpose of
        notifying you when the products you have selected go on sale.
    </p>

    <p class="mt15"><strong>b. Communications: </strong> If you participate in a survey, poll, promotion, contest, or sweepstakes;
        submit a customer service or other inquiry to us; request to receive certain communications from us; or contact us about employment
        opportunities posted to the Services, we may collect contact information such as your name, address, email address, or telephone number.
    </p>

    <h6>B. Information We Collect about your computer or mobile device when you Use the Services</h6>

    <p class="mt15">When you use the Services, we automatically collect and store certain information about your computer or device and your activities,
        including:</p>
    <ol class="numList">
        <li>IP address of your computer</li>
        <li>Unique mobile device identifier</li>
        <li>Technical information about your computer or mobile device such as type of device, mobile device ID number, web browser (Internet Explorer 8, etc.), other browser information (e.g. size, connection speed and connection type), and operating system or platform (Mac, Windows XP, etc.)</li>
        <li>Your preferences and settings (time zone, language, etc.)</li>
        <li>If you are using a mobile device, your mobile device's geographic location (specific geographic location if you have enabled collection of that information, or general geographic location automatically). Please see the section <strong>"About Location Information"</strong> below for further information.</li>
        <li>Internet provider (Verizon, Comcast, etc.) or mobile carrier name (AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc.)</li>
        <li>The URL of the last webpage you visited before visiting Shopping.net</li>
        <li>Information about your activity on the Services (e.g., your search queries, search results selected, clicks, pages viewed, how long you
            visited our Services, etc.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h6>About Location Information</h6>
    <p class="mt15">
        When you use one of our location-enabled services (for example, when you access Services from a mobile device), we may need to collect and process
        information about your actual GPS location (including the latitude, longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and the time the location information
        was recorded. Some of these services require your personal data for the feature to work and we may associate location data with your device ID and
        other information we hold about you. We keep this data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing our services. If you wish to use the
        particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling
        the relevant feature. We have explained how you can disable the collection of Mobile Device Location Information below:
    </p>

    <h6><em>How to Disable the Collection of Mobile Device Location Information</em></h6>
    <ul class="discList">
        <li>If you do not want your location information collected when you use the Services from a mobile device, please follow these instructions:</li>
        <li>If you are using an Apple device, click on "General," then "Reset," then "Reset Location and Privacy." This will turn off location functionality for all of your apps so that the next time you download or use an app, you will be asked again to provide your consent for us and others to access your location information.</li>
        <li>If you are using an Android device, visit device settings, click “Location,” and then click the boxes for the particular applications for which you would like to disable location services.</li>
        <li>If your device changes the above methods of disabling the collection of mobile device location, please contact your device manufacturer or platform provider to determine how to disable the collection of this information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Cookies, Mobile Device IDs and Online Advertising:</h6>

        Cookies from advertising companies enable them to track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record your activities,
        so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you. You may opt-out of receiving targeted online advertising from advertising networks

        If you are using a mobile device, we use your unique mobile device ID number to recognize you when you access our site,
        to store your preferences and settings and to track your use of our Services. Advertising companies may also use and store your mobile device
        ID to track your use of the Services, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and show ads that they consider relevant to
        you in various mobile services that you use. If you are using an iOS device and you do not want to receive tailored in-application ads that

        Flip "Limit Ad Tracking" to ON. If you are using an Android device and you do not wish to receive tailored in-application ads, you can visit Google’s Ads Preferences
        page from a browser on your device and make your choices there. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control
        receiving tailored in-application ads; thus, you should contact the platform provider if the above options are no longer available.
