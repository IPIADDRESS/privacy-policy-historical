            <h1>ShootProof Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy pertains to the use of services related to www.shootproof.com.  Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use any ShootProof services, and so this Privacy Policy makes no provision for children's use of the website.  By accessing the ShootProof Website, you agree to our Privacy Policy as outlined herein.</p>
<h2>What personal information does ShootProof collect?</h2>
<p>ShootProof may collect the following information as provided by you:  your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, billing and credit card or PayPal information.  In some cases high volume photographers may need to provide their tax ID information.  We also keep track of site usage for statistical reporting and analysis.  ShootProof collects this information using direct user input and cookies.  A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser and written to your hard drive.  We use cookies to make using the service more convenient and efficient.  Cookies are commonly used to customize pages for you based on your browser type or other information you may have provided us.  Further, cookies can enable us to track and target the interests of our users to ultimately enhance the experience for you on ShootProof.  You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.  If you reject all cookies, you can still use ShootProof, but you may be limited in some areas of the website.</p>
<h2>Disclosure of personally identifiable information?</h2>
<p>ShootProof will only use the information submitted or collected from you to optimize the service to better suit you, to process e-commerce orders or enable photographers to process orders, and to protect against potentially fraudulent transactions.  ShootProof uses standard industry security practices to protect your personal information including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) transmission technology for all sensitive information exchanges. This technology encrypts information you send us to avoid it being intercepted before reaching our secure HTTPS servers.  ShootProof may engage in 3rd party business relationships such as linkage to 3rd party photo labs to provide our photographers freedom of choice if they choose to fulfill their orders online.  Thus, in the case of a photographer choosing to fulfill an order with a 3rd party photo lab linked to ShootProof, it may be necessary for some information, including photographer client data (e.g. bride and groom information) to be used directly by our partners.  Although ShootProof strives to protect your privacy, we assume no responsibility or liability for the disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond our reasonable control.</p>
<h2>How is my credit card information protected?</h2>
<p>We do not store any credit card information at ShootProof.  We have partnered with Braintree Payment Solutions LLC, for our e-commerce capabilities.  Braintree Payments is a leading provider of gateway services, managing the submission of billions of transactions to the processing networks on behalf of merchant customers.   Further, we provide connectivity to PayPal, a subsidiary of eBay, Inc. (NYSE: EBAY), to lend photographers the ability to receive payments through a service with more than 80 million users in 190 markets and 24 currencies around the world.</p>
<h2>Are my pictures available for public viewing?</h2>
<p>Photographers have the ability to make each event public, private with password, or completely private.  So, private events can be password protected and only those people that you give the password to will have access to proofs of your event photos.</p>
<h2>What do you do with survey responses?</h2>
<p>From time-to-time, ShootProof requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Your responses are completely confidential and are used to help us tailor our services to you. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this website. We appreciate your participation in the on-going development of our service.</p>
<h2>Referrals, Promotional Programs, and Emails</h2>
<p>If a user elects to participate in any of our promotional referral programs for directing guests to our website, we will ask them for the friend's name and email address. ShootProof will send the friend an e-mail inviting them to visit the website.  ShootProof stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this e-mail.  Any guest may contact ShootProof via: "support (at) shootproof.com" to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>
<h2>Changes to the ShootProof Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>If at any time we decide to change the ShootProof Privacy Policy, we will post notification of the change on our homepage so our users are aware of the change and can access the new Privacy Policy details.  Your continued use of the website after such a modification constitues your acceptance of those changes.</p>
