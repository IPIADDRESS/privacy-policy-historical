          <span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Arial; color:#000002">We 
			know that you care how information about you is used and shared, 
			and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and 
			sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting 
			Shipwire.com, you are accepting the practices described in this 
			Privacy Notice. 
			<p><b>What personal information does Shipwire.com gather? </b></p>
			<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and 
			continually improve your shipping experience at Shipwire.com. Here 
			are the types of information we gather. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Information you give us:</b> We receive and store any 
				information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other 
				way.

          <span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Arial; color:#000002">You 
				provide most such information when you price, ship, participate 
				in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with customer 
				service. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with 
				such information as your name, address, and phone numbers; 
				credit card information; people to whom packages have been 
				shipped, including addresses and phone number; people (with 
				addresses and phone numbers) listed in your address book; 
				content of reviews and e-mails to us; personal description; and 
				financial information, including Social Security and driver's 
				license numbers. </span>You can choose not to provide certain 
				information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of 
				many of our features. We use the information that you provide 
				for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing 
				future shipping for you, improving our site, and communicating 
				with you. </li>
				<li><b>Automatic information: </b>We receive and store certain 
				types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, 
				like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain 
				types of information when your Web browser accesses Shipwire.com.
				<span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Arial; color:#000002">
				Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the 
				Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to 
				the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and 
				connection information such as browser type and version, 
				operating system, and platform; shipping history, which we 
				sometimes aggregate with similar information from other 
				customers to create features such as shipping circles and top 
				shippers; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream 
				to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; 
				cookie number; routes you searched for; and the phone number you 
				used to call our 888 number. During some visits we may use 
				software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session 
				information, including page response times, download errors, 
				length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information 
				(such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used 
				to browse away from the page. </span>A number of companies offer 
				utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. 
				Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized 
				experience at Shipwire.com if we cannot recognize you, we want 
				you to be aware that these tools exist. </li>
				<li><b>E-mail communications:</b> To help us make e-mails more 
				useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you 
				open e-mail from Shipwire.com if your computer supports such 
				capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists 
				received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending 
				unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to 
				receive e-mail or other mail from us, please go to the My 
				Account link in the header of any Shipwire page and adjust your 
				Newsletter preferences. </li>
				<li><b>Information from other sources: </b>We might receive 
				information about you from other sources and add it to our 
				account information. Examples of information we receive from 
				other sources include updated delivery and address information 
				from our carriers or other third parties, which we use to 
				correct our records and deliver your next shipment or 
				communication more easily; account information, purchase or 
				redemption information, and page-view information; pricing criteria 
				and pricing result information; and credit history information 
				from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect 
				fraud and to offer certain credit services to some customers.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Does Shipwire.com share the information it receives?</b></p>
			<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our 
			business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We 
			share customer information only as described below. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Affiliated businesses we do not control:</b> We work 
				closely with our affiliated businesses. Examples of co-branded 
				and joint offerings include carriers which handle the delivery 
				of your packages, and brokers which provide your packages with 
				cargo insurance. You can tell when a third party is involved in 
				your transactions, and we share customer information related to 
				those transactions with that third party. </li>
				<li><b>Agents: </b>We employ other companies and individuals to 
				perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling 
				orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, 
				removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing 
				data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results 
				and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit 
				card payments, and providing customer service. They have access 
				to personal information needed to perform their functions, but 
				may not use it for other purposes. </li>
				<li><b>Promotional offers: </b>Sometimes we send offers to 
				selected groups of our customers on behalf of other 
				businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your 
				name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers,
				<span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Arial; color:#000002">
				please go to the My Account link in the header of any Shipwire 
				page and adjust your Newsletter preferences</span>. </li>
				<li><b>Business transfers:</b> As we continue to develop our 
				business, we might sell or buy business 
				units. In such transactions, customer information generally is 
				one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to 
				the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of 
				course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely 
				event that we, or substantially all of our assets are 
				acquired, customer information will of course be one of the 
				transferred assets. </li>
				<li><b>Protection of Shipwire.com and others: </b>We release 
				account and other personal information when we believe release 
				is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our 
				Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, 
				property, or safety of us, our users, or others. This 
				includes exchanging information with other companies and 
				organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 
				Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, 
				sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable 
				information from customers for commercial purposes in violation 
				of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. </li>
				<li><b>With your consent:</b> Other than as set out above, you 
				will receive notice when information about you might go to third 
				parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share 
				the information. </li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>How secure is information about me? </b></p>
			<p>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers 
			when confirming a shipment. Of course, we transmit the entire credit 
			card number to the appropriate credit card company during order 
			processing. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized 
			access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off 
			when finished using a shared computer.</p>
			<p><b>Which information can I access? </b></p>
			<p>Shipwire.com gives you access to a broad range of information 
			about your account and your interactions with Shipwire.com for the 
			limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that 
			information.</p>
			<p><b>Children </b></p>
			<p>If you are under 18, you may use Shipwire.com only with the 
			involvement of a parent or guardian. </p>
			<p><b>Conditions of use, notices, and revisions </b></p>
			<p>If you choose to visit Shipwire.com, your visit and any dispute 
			over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms of Use, 
			including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and 
			application of the law of the state of California. If you have any 
			concern about privacy at Shipwire.com, please contact us with a 
			thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. </p>
			<p>Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the 
			Terms of Use will change also. You should check our Web site 
			frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our 
			current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about 
			you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, 
			and will never materially change our policies and practices to make 
			them less protective of customer information collected in the past 
			without the consent of affected customers. </p>
