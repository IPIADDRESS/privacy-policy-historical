However, if you disable cookies, some advanced and customized features will not be available to you. <br><br><strong>10. Web Beacons</strong><br>Some of our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called “single-pixel gifs”. These images allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not used to access your Personal Information but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about usage on the Sites. Web beacons collect only a limited range of information including the time and date of page view, cookie number and description of the page on which the web beacon resides. <br><br><strong>11. Security of Personal Information</strong><br>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt important information, such as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access during transmission of your orders over the Internet. We implement standard industry practices internally and with our service providers to maintain the security of your Personal Information depending on its sensitivity and to avoid disclosure of such Personal Information unpermitted under this Privacy Policy. <br><br>Although we have implemented systems and procedures to secure the data maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions can never be assured. Shimano employees are made aware of our privacy practices through periodic communications and training. Our policy is to limit access to Personal Information to those Shimano employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve the information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled environments. To maintain security, we conduct internal reviews of our security measures on a regular basis. Please note, however, that any Personal Information you post in chat rooms or message boards is available to anyone. WHILE SHIMANO HAS TAKEN COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS TO SAFEGUARD PERSONAL INFORMATION, SHIMANO CANNOT AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLETE SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE COMPLETE SECURITY DOES NOT PRESENTLY EXIST ON THE INTERNET.<br><br>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.<br><br><strong>12.  Transfer of personal Information</strong><br>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for Shimano or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.  By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Shimano will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.<br><br><strong>13. Third Party Advertising</strong><br>Advertisements appearing on our Sites may be delivered to users by us or one of our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Shimano only, and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br><br><strong>14. Children</strong><br>We will not knowingly collect Personal Information via the Sites from visitors younger than thirteen (13) years of age. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose on websites. <br><br><strong>15. Changes in Corporate Structure</strong><br>In developing our business, we may engage in the sale or transfer of certain assets and the company itself, or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise assigned. In such transactions and changes in ownership, user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may constitute one of the transferred assets. If required by law, we will notify affected users of such transfer or assignment in accordance with the procedure for changing this Privacy Policy described below.<br><br><br><strong>16. Changes to our Privacy Policy</strong><br>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy as necessary to protect our users and to accommodate a changing environment. The changes to our Privacy Policy will be deemed to be effective from the date of posting on our Sites unless we specify otherwise. We recommend that you check the Privacy Policy when you visit our Sites to be sure that you are aware of and understand our current policy. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will make efforts to prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. We will not make any retroactive material changes in how we handle previously collected Personal Information unless you allow us to do so, or unless we are legally required to do so, and in such a case we will make efforts to inform registered visitors of information on material changes to this Privacy Policy via email. <br><br>Contact Information for Questions or Complaints<br>Please contact us if you have any questions, comments or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy, our privacy practices or our treatment of your Personal Information.  <br>Please refer to contact information of Shimano and the respective Group Companies posted on our Sites.<br><br>This Privacy Policy was last updated on 19 June 2012.  “Policy for protection of personal information” and “Handling of customer information”, which was posted on the Japanese website of Shimano, was abolished as of 19 June 2012.<br><br>* The Sites include but are not limited to and may be updated without notice http://www.shimano.com http://www.shimano.com.au, http://www.shimano-china.com, http://cycle.shimano-eu.com, http://www.shimano-benelux.com, http://www.shimano-nordic.com, http://www.shimano-france.com, http://cycle.shimano.co.jp, http://bike.shimano.com, http://www.coasting.com, http://pro-bikegear.com, http://www.shimano-eyewear.com, http://www.shimano-cyclingwear.com, http://techdocs.shimano.com, http://www.shimanofish.com.au, http://fish.shimano-eu.com, http://shimanofireblood.com, http://shimanocarpexpert.com, http://fishing.shimano.co.jp, http://lafish.shimano.com, http://boat.shimano.com, and http://aifie.shimano.com. <br><br>***<br><br></div>
