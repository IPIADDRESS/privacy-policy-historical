	<div class="text"><br>This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about the practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide via the websites owned or operated by Shimano, Inc. and its affiliates (“Shimano”) (collectively, the “Sites”)<b>*</b>.   Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use (the “Terms”), available at <a href="/publish/content/global_corp/en/us/index/about_shimano/terms_and_conditions.html" title="Terms and Conditions of Use">here</a>, before using or submitting information to the Sites. 	<br><br><b>Consent</b><br>By using the Sites, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via the Sites, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.	 <br><br><b>Information Collected</b><br><br><i>Information You Volunteer</i><br>Shimano collects personally identifiable information that you volunteer (such as your name, date of birth, e-mail address, credit card information, shipping and billing address, etc.) in order to provide you with certain information you request, to conduct surveys and contests, and fulfill your order of products purchased on the Sites.  <br><i><br>Information Collected Automatically</i><br>Shimano also automatically collects your IP and referring website addresses, browser type, domain name and website access times. This information helps facilitate your online experience on the Sites. Shimano uses cookies to track usage patterns on the Sites and to control the display of ads, as well as to offer other functionalities (such as screening for age and “recognizing” you to speed up your log-in when you visit the Sites). You can turn off cookies, but that will affect your online experience. See below for more detail on cookies.<br><br><b>Uses of Collected Information</b><br>Shimano uses information you provide to fulfill your requests and improve the Sites and materials contained thereon. Shimano may, from time to time, produce reports for advertisers, sponsors, affiliates and vendors containing anonymous, aggregate information about our users and customers, such as demographic, age and online usage information.  This information allows Shimano to provide content and offers that are most relevant to our users to work more closely with advertisers.  We do not include any personally identifiable information of our users in these reports.<br><br>Shimano uses personal information so that we may display or send custom, personalized content to our users and send newsletters, mail, e-mails, features, promotional material, surveys and other updates, information or offers to our users. A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving such information by clicking on the link in any such e-mail. Shimano also uses collected information to evaluate and administer our products and services, fulfill customer requests, respond to any future problems, such as difficulties in navigating our Sites or accessing certain features, and to gauge user trends to determine what products and services are most popular with users.<br><br><b>Sharing of Collected Information</b><br>Personal information is available to Shimano and the technical agents and consultants who make the Sites available to you. Anonymous information is available to Shimano’s advertisers, sponsors and promotional and business partners. Shimano only shares your personal information with third parties only as described below.  <br><br><i>Shimano and Its Agents </i><br>Shimano may access both anonymous, aggregate demographic data and any personal information you provide for internal marketing purposes, including sending you notices of new products.  All companies working for and with Shimano must comply with our Privacy Policy, and are not permitted to sell or otherwise disclose your information to third parties except as authorized by us and you, or as permitted or required by law.  BY AGREEING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU ARE AUTHORIZING US TO SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BY AND WITH OUR AFFILIATED COMPANIES.<br><br><i>Advertisers, Sponsors and Promotional and Business Partners.</i><br>Shimano shares anonymous, aggregate demographic information, and anonymous information obtained from cookies and similar technologies, with our sponsors, promotional and business partners, and participating vendors.  No personally identifiable information, such as credit card information, is disclosed to any of these third parties in providing these reports.  <br><br>Your e-mail address is not shared with third parties unless you agree to receive information, by opting-in, from third parties.  In other words, we may extend e-mail offers to users or customers on behalf of our business partners about a particular product or service that may be of interest to you, but only if you have indicated that you would like to receive these offers. If you wish to receive such offers, we will not share or disclose your name or e-mail address to those business partners, but will send you the information or offers on their behalf. As result, although we may receive a fee from our business partners for this service, we send the offers so that your personal information is never shared with any outside third party. Of course, you may opt out of receiving these offers at any time.<br>  <br>Sometimes we will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive e-mail offers from third parties not affiliated with us.  If you decide to accept these offers, we will provide, with your consent, your contact information to the third party. We urge visitors to review carefully the privacy policies of these firms. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and procedures of any third party.  <br><br>You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area, that information can be collected and used by others.  For example, if you use chat, forums, bulletin boards or message boards, or if you post personal information online (such as your e-mail address), you may receive unsolicited messages from others. We have no control over this use of your personal information.  <br><br><i>Credit Card Companies</i> <br>As in any transaction, your credit card company will have all relevant information about the name of the vendor, item(s) purchased, date, total cost and other information necessary to process the transaction. Shimano will not otherwise provide any personal data to your credit card company without your permission.<br><br><b>Important Note</b><br>Shimano reserves the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent for the following purposes: (i) as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, (ii) to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law, (iii) to protect the integrity of our Sites and our property, (iv) to protect the safety of our visitors or others, (v) to fulfill your requests, or (vi) to cooperate in any legal investigation.<br><br><b>Cookies</b><br>Your Web browser offers so-called “cookies” which, if you allow their use, store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information about you and therefore cannot be used to identify you personally. However, cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best. Therefore, Cookies enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser settings.  Our Sites are viewable even if you disable the cookie function on your browser. However, if you disable cookies, some advanced and customized features will not be available to you. <br><br><b>Web Beacons</b><br>Some of our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called “single-pixel gifs”. These images allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about usage on the Sites. Web beacons collect only a limited range of information including the time and date of page view, cookie number and description of the page on which the Web beacon resides.  <br><br><b>Security of Personal Information</b><br>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt important information, such as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access during transmission of your orders over the Internet. We incorporate standard industry practices internally and with our service providers, which we believe suits the degree of sensitivity of the information involved to maintain the security of your personal information and to avoid its disclosure except as described in this Privacy Policy. <br><br>Although we have implemented systems and procedures to secure the data maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions can never be assured. Shimano employees are made aware of our privacy practices through periodic communications and training. Our policy is to limit access to personal data to those Shimano employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve this information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled environments. To maintain security, we conduct internal reviews of our security measures on a regular basis. Remember, however, that any personal information you post in chat rooms or message boards is available to anyone.  WHILE SHIMANO HAS TAKEN COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS TO SAFEGUARD PERSONAL INFORMATION, SHIMANO CANNOT AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLETE SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE COMPLETE SECURITY DOES NOT PRESENTLY EXIST ON THE INTERNET.<br><br><b>Third Party Advertising</b><br>Advertisements appearing on our Sites may be delivered to users by us or one of our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Shimano only, and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br><br><b>Children</b><br>We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via the Sites from visitors younger than thirteen (13) years of age. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to Web sites.  <br><br><b>Use and Disclosure</b><br>Except as otherwise stated, we may use information collected via the Sites to improve the content of our Sites, to customize the site to your preferences, to communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes, and for any other reasons we deem reasonable and necessary. In addition, we may make full use of all information acquired through the Sites that is not in personally identifiable form. If you provide personally identifiable information through the Sites, we may combine such information with other actively collected information unless we specify otherwise at the point of collection. We may disclose personally identifiable information you provide via the Sites to other Shimano affiliates worldwide that agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes. <br><br><b>Changes in Corporate Structure</b><br>In developing our business, we may engage in the sale of certain assets and the company itself, or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise transferred. In such transactions and changes in ownership, user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may constitute one of the transferred assets. We will notify affected users in accordance with the procedure for changing this Privacy Policy described below.<br><br><b>Changes to our Privacy Policy</b><br>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy as necessary to protect our users and to comply with a changing environment. We recommend that you check the Privacy Policy when you visit our Sites to be sure that you are aware of and understand our current policy. If we make material changes to this policy, or in how we use or collect your personally identifiable information, we will prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. We will not make any retroactive material changes in how we handle previously collected personal information unless you allow us to do so, or unless we are legally required to do so, and in such a case we will e-mail registered visitors information on material changes to this Privacy Policy. <br><br>This Privacy Policy was last updated on August 28, 2009.<br><br><b>Contact Information</b><br>Please send any questions or comments to your local Shimano office.<br><br> <b>*</b> The Sites include but are not limited to and may be updated without notice http://www.shimano.com http://www.shimano.com.au, http://www.shimano-china.com, http://cycle.shimano-eu.com, http://www.shimano-benelux.com, http://www.shimano-nordic.com, http://www.shimano-france.com, http://cycle.shimano.co.jp, http://bike.shimano.com, http://www.coasting.com, http://pro-bikegear.com, http://www.shimano-eyewear.com, http://www.shimano-cyclingwear.com, http://techdocs.shimano.com, http://www.shimanofish.com.au, http://fish.shimano-eu.com, http://shimanofireblood.com, http://shimanocarpexpert.com, http://fishing.shimano.co.jp, http://lafish.shimano.com,  http://boat.shimano.com, and http://aifie.shimano.com.				<br><br>***</div>
