<p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) of Auctane d/b/a ShipStation ("ShipStation") describes in greater detail the privacy practices of ShipStation and its corporate affiliates, meaning companies related by common ownership or control (“us,” “we,” “our”) responsible for collecting and maintaining certain information collected about you.</p>

<p>If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us as detailed under the How to Contact Us heading below.</p>

<p>We participate in the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">E.U. - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework</a> and comply with the Privacy Shield Principles. Click <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>We take the privacy of our Customers and their downstream customers very seriously. We never share the information of our Customer’s customers under any circumstances, unless it is required to complete the transaction contracted with our Customer. In addition, we require our Customers, where applicable, to undertake to respect the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.</p>

<h2>1. WHEN THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES.</h2>
<p>This Policy applies to our sites, products, and services (collectively, "Services") that link to this Policy. ShipStation is the controller of all Personal Information subject to this Policy for our Services. <strong>If a Service you use links to this Privacy Policy, this Policy applies to you.</strong></p>

<h2>2. WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION.</h2>
<p><strong>We want to be clear about what information we collect and how we use it to deliver our Services to you, operate our business, and make our Services work better for you.</strong> This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share and secure the information that you provide which can be used to identify you and that is shared with us (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”). It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your Personal Information. <strong>We do not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their own commercial uses, if you have opted out of such sharing.</strong></p>

<p><strong>a) Types of Information We Collect.</strong> In connection with access to our Services, we may collect Personal Information, such as your name, shipping/billing address, email address, phone, credit card/bank account number, username and password.</p>
<p>We collect or otherwise receive information when you register or open an account, sign in, pay fees, purchase or otherwise use a Service, call us for support, or give us feedback. We may also obtain information from other companies or third parties, such as when you synchronize a third party account or service with your ShipStation Account, or when we may use service providers to supplement the Personal Information you give us (e.g., validate your mailing address) to help us maintain the accuracy of your data and provide you with better service. We may collect content or other information that you may provide or create when you interact with our Services.</p>

<p>We may automatically collect certain usage information when you access our Services ("Usage Data"), such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, log files, unique device identifiers, pages viewed, browser type, any links you click on to leave or interact with our Services, and other usage information collected from cookies and other tracking technologies. For example, we may collect IP addresses to track and aggregate retained in pseudonym form (replacing any directly identifying characteristics of personal information, to monitor the locations from which users navigate to our Services. We may also collect IP addresses from users when they log into the Services as part of our log-in and security features. We may also, when you enable location-based Services, collect Global Positioning System (GPS) location data and/or motion data.</p>
<p>Our Services may change over time and we may introduce new features that may collect new or different types of information.</p>
<p><strong>b) How We Use Your Information.</strong> We may use your information, including your Personal Information, for the following purposes:</p>

<p><u>Account Registration.</u> We may use your name, address, phone number, billing information, and email address to register your account for certain Services we provide and to communicate important information to you. We may obtain additional Personal Information about you, such as address change information, from commercially available sources, to keep our records current. If you establish an administrator account that may be accessed by people other than you, please note that they may see and have the ability to change or delete your Personal Information. Please be careful to whom you grant administrator access to, as you are responsible for their actions.</p>
<p><u>To Provide Our Services and Operate Our Business.</u> We may use your information to operate our business, including providing Services you requested, provide you with support related to our Services, and to help us protect our Services, including to combat fraud and protect your information.</p>
<p><u>Customer Service and Technical Support.</u> We may use your name, address, phone number, email address, how you interact with our Services, and information about your computer configuration to resolve questions you may have about our Services and to follow up with you about your experience. We also offer various Internet chat services, for example, to speak with a ShipStation customer support representative. Internet Chat transmissions are encrypted, but you should not supply more Personal Information than is required to address your specific issue. A transcript of the session may be retained to resolve questions or issues related to our Services.</p>
<p><u>Communicate with You and Tell You About Other Services.</u> We may use your information to communicate with you about our Services and to give you offers for third party products and services that we think may be of use to you. Please see below under "What You Can Do to Manage Your Privacy" for the choices you have regarding these communications.</p>
<p><u>To Improve Services and Develop New Services.</u> We will use your information to personalize or customize your experience and the Service, develop new features or services, and to improve the overall quality of ShipStation's Services.</p>
<p><u>Feedback.</u> We may use any information you volunteer in surveys you answer for us and combine them with answers from other customers in order to better understand our Services and how we may improve them. Answering any survey is optional.</p>

<p><strong>c) How We Share Your Personal Information.</strong> From time to time, we may need to share your Personal Information with others.</p>

<p><u>Third Party Service Providers.</u> We may share your information, including Personal Information and Usage Data, with third party service providers who perform various functions to enable us to provide our Services and help us operate our business, such as website design, sending email communications, telephone communication, SMS (text messaging), advertising, fraud detection and prevention, customer care, third party surveys or performing analytics. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. Our contracts with these third parties require them to maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Information we provide to them, only act on our behalf and under our instructions, and not use Personal Information for purposes other than the product or service they're providing to us or on our behalf.</p>
<p><u>United States Postal Service (USPS).</u> ShipStation is regulated by the USPS. As part of the regulatory relationship, ShipStation collects certain information about you on behalf of the USPS. The USPS also may send us tracking data from their scans of your mail and packages in the mailstream. Our uses for the data include informing you about the status of your mail and packages through options like USPS Tracking, fraud detection and aggregating the data to help the USPS and us provide you better service.
