<p>Shiply ("Shiply", "we", "us" or "our") respects the privacy of every
individual who visits this www.shiply.com web site (the "Site"). This Privacy
Policy governs the way in which we use and disclose any personal information
(the "Personal Information" that you provide to us whilst visiting the Site.
Personal Information includes any information that identifies you or another
individual personally, such as your name, address or email address.  </p>
<font size="3">Overview</font>
<p>The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available under
the domain and subdomains of www.shiply.com (the “Site”). By visiting this
website, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy
Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use or access our site.</p>
<p>By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you
expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in
accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into
and subject to the terms of the Shiply User Agreement.</p>
<font size="3">Information Collection &amp; Use</font>
<p>In order to use this Site, you must first complete the registration/sign up form. During the registration process, you are
required to give contact information such as name, address, phone number and
email address. This allows us to provide services and features that
meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your on-site experience safer and
easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider
necessary for achieving this purpose.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our
Site, we may require you to provide contact and identity information and other personal information as indicated on the forms
throughout the Site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and
which are optional with the use of the * symbol. You always have the option to not provide information by
choosing not to use a particular service or individual feature.</p>
<p>We may track certain information based upon your behaviour on the
Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users’
demographics, interest, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve you
and the marketplace. This information may include information such as the URL that you  came from,
which URL you go to next, your computer browser information, and your IP
address.</p>
<p>If you choose to list shipments, or bid on shipments on the Site, we collect information about
your activity and behaviour. We also collect other users’ comments about you in
our feedback area.</p>
<p>If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, phone
calls or if
other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or
postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to
you.</p>
<p>If you email a shipment listing to a friends, we will ask you for your
friend’s name and email address.&nbsp; These details will not be stored and will
only be used to send the one-time email.</p>
<font size="3">Uses of Your Information</font>
<p>We use your personal information, including your email address, to help facilitate
our services to you. We use your personal information in the file we
maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past
activities on the Site to: resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote
safe bid acceptance; collect fees owed; measure consumer interest in our products and
services; inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and
updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud
and other criminal activity; enforce our User Agreement; and as otherwise
described to you at the time of collection. We may examine your personal information to identify users using multiple User IDs. We may
also compare and review your personal information for errors,
omissions and for accuracy.</p>
<p>You agree that we may use personal information, including your email address
to help our marketing and promotional efforts. These uses improve the Site and
better tailor it to meet your needs.</p>
<font size="3">Communications from the Site.</font>
<p>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, and
promotions, as well as a newsletter. You are signed up for these emails at
registration and you may unsubscribe at any time by going to your account
and opting out, or by following the directions to
unsubscribe in the email.</p>
<p>Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe from
each of these communications. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter
and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following
the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by opting out
in the "My Account" section of My Shiply.</p>
<p>It is

our policy not to make any personal information available to any third parties.</p>
<font size="3">Information Sharing and Disclosure</font>
<p>We do not sell, rent or share any of your personal
information, including your email address, to third parties for their marketing
purposes without your explicit consent. However, the following describes some of
the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of
business to provide our services.</p>
<p>Your Shiply User ID is displayed throughout the Site and is
therefore available to the public. All of your activities on the Site will be
identifiable to your User ID. Other members can see your bids, shipments you have
listed, your feedback rating and associated comments, your postings on the Site
etc. Therefore, if you associate your name with your User ID, the people
you have revealed your name to will be able to personally identify your Shiply
activities. If you are involved in a successful bid (whether as a user or
service provider), we have features that allow
parties to the bid to view your email address and obtain your contact
information in order to complete the shipment.  </p>
<p>Shiply cooperates fully with law enforcement inquiries, as well as
other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights,
fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the Shiply marketplace. Therefore, in response to a
genuine request by law enforcement relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal
activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, address,
telephone number, email address, User ID history, fraud complaints,  bidding
and listing history and any information we have on file for your account. We will not
however otherwise disclose your personal information to law
enforcement or other government officials without a  court order or
substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that
the disclosure of information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or
financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity.</p>
<p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your
private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in
ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example we may be forced to disclose personal information,
including your email address, to the government or credible third parties under certain
circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or
private communications, or members may abuse/misuse your personal information
that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard
practices to protect your privacy, we cannot promise, and you should not expect,
that your personal information or private communications will always remain
private.</p>
<font size="3">Log Files</font>
<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather some information automatically and
store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP)
addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,
operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this
information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to
administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather
demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this
automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information in any way.</p>
<p>We use a third-party tracking service called Omniture that uses cookies and
log files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our
site in the aggregate. We track trends in users’ usage and volume statistics to
create a more efficient and usable site, and to determine areas of the site that
could be improved to enhance the user experience.</p>
<font size="3">Links to Other Sites</font>
<p>The Shiply Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled
by Shiply. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices
of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to
read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally
identifiable information.</p>
<font size="3">Access to Personally Identifiable Information</font>
<p>If your personally identifiable information, including your email address,
changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete
or deactivate it by making the change on our member Account page or by
contacting <a href="/support">customer service.</a></p>
<font size="3">Security</font>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter
sensitive information on our registration or order
forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal
information, including your email address, submitted to us, both during
transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the
Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore,
while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<font size="3">Business Transitions</font>
<p>In the event Shiply goes through a business transition, such as a merger,
acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your
personally identifiable information, including your email address, will likely
be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such
change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
<font size="3">Changes in this Privacy Statement</font>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this
privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please
check it regularly.<br>
