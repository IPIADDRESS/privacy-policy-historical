<h2>Shiftgig, Inc. Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>Thank you for visiting our website, <a href="http://www.Shiftgig.com">www.Shiftgig.com</a> (“Site”).  Shiftgig, Inc. (“Shiftgig”) has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to the privacy of our users.  This Privacy Policy explains the information we collect, how that information is collected, disseminated, used and with whom it is shared.  Should you create an account, such account is set up to allow you to interact and share information with other users and allows you to control the amount and type of information you would like to share.  By using our Site, you represent and warrant that you have thoroughly read, understand and agree to all terms and conditions stated herein and the terms and conditions set forth in the Terms of Use incorporated herein by reference. </p>
<p>Note: the privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy are for the Site only and we are not responsible for the privacy, hiring practices or the content of other web sites. This Site contains links to other websites and if you, the user, elect to link to other websites, please review the privacy policies posted on those sites.</p>
<h3>Information Collected</h3>
<p>Shiftgig’s mission is to create a social network for the service industry which would allow businesses in the service industry (“Businesses”) and service industry employees or potential candidates for employment (“Gig SeekersTM”) to connect and give Gig SeekersTM the opportunity to develop their own profile of experience.  However, we are not a placement service and can provide no assurance of any interviews or hiring.  Shiftgig users voluntarily provide information which Shiftgig uses to further its mission and provide the best possible services to its users.  Some of the information collected may be personally identifiable, including names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.

Please note that, should you choose not to provide us with certain identifying information, you may be unable to use certain features of the Site.  Pursuant to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use and subject to any exclusions stated herein, you agree that all information provided to Shiftgig shall immediately become the property of Shiftgig.  Shiftgig collects information from users as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Account Creation:  In order to create an account, you must provide us with personal information such as your full name, email address, address, telephone number and a password for your account.  You may be required to submit credit card information if you elect to utilize any of the services which require payment.  In addition to personal information, Shiftgig will require some non-personal information in order to provide more customized services to you including employment opportunities and valuable ads.  Please do not use a password that is readily ascertainable by others.  By creating a Shiftgig account, you acknowledge that Shiftgig and others are allowed to use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.</li>

Therefore, we recommend that you only add information to your profile using caution and care.  You expressly authorize us to use, forward, or post your profile and/or resume on other social media and internet platforms, sites or services.
