    Sysinternals Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>
    Sysinternals LLC ("Sysinternals"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation,
    is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement applies to the data
    collected by Sysinternals through the Sysinternals site (the "Site"); it does not
    apply to data collected through other online or offline Sysinternals sites, products
    or services.
</p>
<h2>
    Collection of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows
    us to contact you. The personal information we collect may include, for example,
    name, email address, date of birth, and demographic information.
</p>
<p>
    We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links
    you click and other actions taken in connection with the Site. We also collect certain
    standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as
    your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site
    addresses.
</p>
<h2>
    Use of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site
    and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested
    or authorized.
</p>
<p>
    In support of these uses, Sysinternals may use personal information to provide you
    with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related products
    or services of Sysinternals or its affiliates, and to make the Site easier to use
    by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing
    the Site to your particular preferences or interests.
</p>
<p>
    We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about
    the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications.
    Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about other Sysinternals
    products and services, and/or share information with Sysinternals partners so they
    may send you information about their products and services.
</p>
<p>
    Sysinternals occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our
    behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing and delivering prizes, answering
    customer questions about products and services, and sending information about our
    products, special offers, and other new services. We will only provide those companies
    the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to
    maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that
    information for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>
    Sysinternals and its affiliates may disclose personal information if required to
    do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform
    to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Sysinternals or
    the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Sysinternals and our
    Web site; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users
    of Sysinternals products or members of the public.
</p>
<p>
    Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United
    States or any other country in which Sysinternals or its affiliates, subsidiaries
    or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any such transfer
    of information outside of your country. Sysinternals abides by the safe harbor framework
    as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
    retention of data from the European Union.
</p>
<h2>
    Control of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide
    on the Site will not be shared outside of Sysinternals and its controlled subsidiaries
    and affiliates without your permission.
</p>
<p>
    If you would like to update your contact preferences, please contact us by <a href="mailto:customerservice@winternals.com">clicking
    here</a>. You may also stop the delivery
    of future email newsletters or marketing messages by following the specific instructions
    in the email you receive.
</p>
<p>
    Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the Site
    will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to Sysinternals
    or its subsidiaries and affiliates in the context of other, separately operated,
    products or services offered by Sysinternals or its subsidiaries and affiliates.
</p>
<h2>
    Access to Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    You can review and edit the personal information you have provided in your optional
    public areas profile by following the instructions in the "Public Areas" section
    of this statement. You can access and request that we update the personal information
    you have otherwise provided at the Site, if any, by contacting us using the methods
    described at the bottom of this statement.
</p>
<h2>
    Security of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    Sysinternals is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.
    We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal
    information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store
    the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that
    are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal
    information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through
    the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
</p>
<h2>
    Use of Cookies
</h2>
<p>
    We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration process
    and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your
    hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver
    viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be
    read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
</p>
<p>
    One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
    you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site,
    a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
    This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation,
    and so on. When you return to the web site, the information you previously provided
    can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized.
</p>
<p>
    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
    accept cookies, but you can usually choose to decline cookies if you prefer. If
    you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use interactive features of
    this or other web sites that depend on cookies.
</p>
<h2>
    Public Areas</h2>
<p>
    To use the forums, chat rooms and other public areas on the Site, we request that
    you create a social nickname which is the name you will be known by to others in
    public areas. It is also possible to create an optional profile for public areas
    during registration. In your profile, you may include such information as your name,
    location, homepage, interests, messaging user names, and an avatar. All such information
    is optional and, while you may choose to hide your email address from other users
    of public areas, everything you enter in your profile will otherwise be visible
    to other users of public areas on the Site. We urge you to be careful only to enter
    information on your profile that you are comfortable sharing with the public at
    large. You may edit, delete, or modify information in your profile at any time by
    logging in to the Site's public areas and navigating to the "Member Control Panel
    Menu."
</p>
<h2>
    Changes to this Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>
    We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise
    the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes
    to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice
    on the home page of our web site or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage
    you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how we
    are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of
    the service constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates.
</p>
<h2>
    Contact Information</h2>
<p>
    Sysinternals welcomes your comments regarding this privacy statement. If you have
    questions about this statement or believe that we have not adhered to it, please
