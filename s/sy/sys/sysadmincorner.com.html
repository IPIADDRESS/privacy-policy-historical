                        <p>When you enter Oracle Solved, we collect your browser information (which typically includes browser type, version, host operating system and browser language) and IP address. Oracle Solved uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and for other administrative purposes including, but not limited to, directing you to a geographically closer data center, providing you a registration page in your country's local currency. We also use IP addresses to gather broad demographic information from all visitors. You can browse portions of this website without giving us any additional information.</p>
                        
                        <p>Most of the services offered on Oracle Solved are only made available if we have certain information about you. To access these services, you will, from time to time, be asked to submit personal information about yourself. Oracle Solved's site registration form requires you to give us contact information (such as your name and email address), credit card information and demographic information (such as your zip code). Aggregate demographic, sales and traffic information data is also collected at our site. We may use this data for improving the services offered on Oracle Solved and developing marketing programs. Oracle Solved may also provide aggregate (but not personally identifiable) statistics about our members, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to advertisers and third-party vendors. </p>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>You will have the opportunity to make certain personal information on your user profile information visible (public) or invisible (private). By default, profile information is set to private. You can change your profile to public (and vice-versa) at any time by going to "My Profile – Edit.”</p>
                        
                        <p>If you make any postings to public areas, such as public forums or by providing content, then this information will be stored on our databases for public viewing, and in such case, any personally identifiable information you submit will be publicly available and can be read, collected and used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.</p>
                        
                        <p>By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable Oracle Solved and its service providers to provide you with the services you select.

Cookies themselves record those areas of the site that have been visited by the computer in question, and for how long.

                        <p>Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these, of course, means that certain personalized services cannot then be provided to that user. You can, should you chose, disable the cookies from your browser and delete all cookies currently stored on your computer. This may, however, prevent you from taking advantage services that Oracle Solved has to offer. </p>
