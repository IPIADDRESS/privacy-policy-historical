<p><strong>9. Cookies and other online tracking systems</strong></p>
<p>Sydney Airport uses cookies and other tracking systems on our website. A cookie is a very small text file which is stored on your computer’s hard drive when you first visit the Website. This information may be used in a number of ways, such as, to identify repeat visitors to our Website, areas of interest on our Website and to analyse visiting patterns. Sydney Airport does not use cookies to obtain personal information.</p>
<p>You can disable your web browser from accepting cookies. If you do so, you can still access the Website, but not all services, transaction or functions may be available.</p>
<p>Where devices connect, or individuals log on, to Sydney Airport’s internet terminals or through Wi-Fi at Sydney Airport’s premises, we may collect aggregated information regarding internet usage. We may also collect some personal information with your consent.</p>
<p>Sydney Airport partners with third party advertising networks to either display advertising on Sydney Airport’s internet terminals or through Wi-Fi at Sydney Airport’s premises to users’ mobile devices and laptops. If you respond in the affirmative (yes) to a particular sponsored or third party advertiser’s question we will be supplying your contact details and cookie data to that sponsor only, this sponsor may use this information to contact you or display relevant offers on their or 3rd party websites.</p>
<p>Sydney Airport’s partners may use cookies and web beacons to collect information, which is not personal information, about your internet activities to provide you with targeted advertising based upon your interests.</p>

<p>Where a device (for example mobile telephones, tablets or laptops) is identifiable by our Wi-Fi or Bluetooth networks at Sydney Airport, we or our third party service providers may collect data relating to the device identification code and its location. We use this data to better understand space utilisation and passenger flows for security purposes and in order to improve the customer experience and our services. All data collected will be anonymous and will not be linked to individual users or to any other personal information.</p>
<p><strong>11. What if you refuse to supply information?</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, you are not obliged to provide us with personal information about you. However, failure to do so may mean that we are unable to transact business with you, process any application for the issue of an authority, licence, pass or permit, or provide you with an appropriate level of service.</p>
<p><strong>12. Dealing with Sydney Airport anonymously or using a pseudonym</strong></p>
<p>In many cases, we will need certain personal information to respond to queries, or to transact with you, such as contact details, or other information as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You may access the website on an anonymous basis or contact Sydney Airport with a general query anonymously or using a pseudonym. However, where you are purchasing services from us (such as parking) you will ordinarily not be able to complete the booking without providing us with certain personal information.</p>
<p><strong>13. Opting in or out</strong></p>
<p>At the point we collect information from you, you may be asked to “opt in” to consent to us using or disclosing your personal information other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable law. For example, you may be asked to opt-in to receive further information or communications from our advertisers and supporters which do not fall into one of the categories described above.</p>
<p>You will generally be given the opportunity to “opt out” from receiving communications from us or from third parties that send communications to you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, you will be given the option to unsubscribe from e-newsletters and other marketing or promotional material sent by us. You may “opt out” from receiving these communications by clicking on an unsubscribe link at the end of an email.</p>
