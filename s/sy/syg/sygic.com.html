	<h4>Scope</h4>

	<p>Sygic a.s. and affiliates (collectively “Sygic”, “us”, or “we”)
	appreciate the interest you (“You” or “Your”) have shown in our products
	and services by visiting our websites, <a href="http://www.sygic.com">www.sygic.com</a> or related communication channels
	such as PoliceTraps.com (collectively, the „Websites“). This Privacy Policy
	outlines our guidelines for the information Sygic collects when You interact
	with Sygic, such as when You visit our Websites, when You use the products and
	services offered by Sygic, when You subscribe to our newsletter or when You
	contact our Customer Support.</p>

	<p>“<strong>Personal Information</strong>” is information about You that is
	personally identifiable to You like Your name, address, e-mail address, or phone
	number.</p>

	<p>“<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>” means information that is not
	associated with or linked to Your Personal Information. Anonymous Information
	does not permit identification of You. Anonymous Information, such as basic
	usage statistics regarding Your use of the products and services offered by
	Sygic, does not by itself identify You to Sygic, though such information may be
	unique or consist of or contain information that You consider personal.</p>

	<p>In accessing the Websites You accept all the terms and conditions of this
	Privacy Policy. You also agree that Sygic may amend and/or revise this Privacy
	Policy at its discretion, and You agree to be bound by these revisions and
	amendments. Your Personal Information may be processed in the country where it
	was collected as well as in other countries (including the United States) where
	laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the
	laws in Your country.</p>

	<p>If You do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy we
	request that You immediately cease using and accessing the Websites as well as
	the products and services for which You need to provide Personal
	Information.</p>

	<h4>Collection of Information by Sygic</h4>

	<p>The Personal Information we gather from You helps us learn about our visitors
	and customers. We use this information to provide You with our products and
	services and the products and services of our carefully selected partners, to
	develop new products and services, to better tailor the features, performance
	and support of our products and services, and to offer You additional
	information and opportunities.</p>

	<p>We collect Personal Information that You submit to us voluntarily through our
	Websites and Your use of our products and services. We may collect Anonymous
	Information passively or actively. The types of Personal Information and
	Anonymous Information we collect&nbsp;are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>If You set up a “My Account” account, we will collect Your contact
			details such as email address and country, as well as, if appreciated, the
			information You provide us with in order to receive the newsletter of Your
			preference.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>If You buy products or services from our web store, we will collect Your full
			name, the name of Your company (if applicable), Your postal address, e-mail,
			phone number. The online payment is processed by RBS WorldPay system, which is
			the payment processing business of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, one of the
			largest banks in the world and a leading global brand. To guarantee the security
			of your payments, Sygic has chosen to use the biggest banking partners, as well
			as a secure, encrypted connection (SSL) technology. The name BIBIT B.V. may
			appear on your bank account statement. Please note that if the security
			department suspects fraud, we have the right to cancel the transaction for
			security reasons. The information we need to process Your payment of the
			purchase amount such as a bank account number or a credit card number is not
			among the information we collect.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>If You request customer support services for Sygic products and/or services,
			we will collect Personal Information to enable us to provide customer support
			services to You, including Your name, email address, etc. We will also collect
			other information about the Sygic products You own, such as the serial numbers,
			date of purchase and information related to a support or service issue, some of
			which might include Personal Information.</p>

		<li>
			<p>By using a bulletin board or a chat room at our Websites, You should be aware
			that You are sharing all information You post on such bulletin boards or chat
			rooms with other users, including any Personal Information that You may choose
			to share, which shall become public information. Please choose the information
			that You share carefully. Sygic has no control over and is not responsible for
			anyone’s&nbsp;use, misuse, collection or disclosure of information You provide on
			a bulletin board or in a chat room by any third party. The information presented
			on bulletin boards and in chat rooms reflects the views of the
			individual&nbsp;users.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>By joining a Sygic community, like Policetraps.com , Sygic will collect
			Personal Information like Your email address and any such information You will
			voluntarily provide to Sygic like map corrections or police traps report etc.
			This Personal Information is used for the purpose for which You provide it
			to&nbsp;Sygic.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Your user account name may be displayed throughout our Websites (and so
			available to the public) and is connected to all of Your Sygic activity. Other
			people can see Your posts, uploads, feedback, ratings and associated comments.
			Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and policy
			violations on our Websites refer to user accounts and specific items. If You
			associate Your name with Your user account, the people to whom You have revealed
			Your name will be able to identify Your Sygic activities.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>You may also be asked to provide Personal Information about a person other
			than Yourself (for example if You want to purchase a gift for someone and this
			Personal Information is required for the fulfilment of the delivery of Your
			purchase), such as name, address, email address. This Personal Information is
			used only for the purpose for which You provide it to&nbsp;Sygic.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Sygic may collect Personal Information through surveys for market research
			purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers, to improve our
			products and services, and to develop new products and services. The information
			we collect in such instances depends on the survey, but might include Your name,
			address, age, information about Your use of our services and products and
			the&nbsp;like.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>If You subscribe to Sygic location-based services like Polictraps.com, Sygic
			may collect location data from Your device in order to provide You with the
			services requested.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>If You send us an email to apply for a position with Sygic, we will collect
			Your email address and the full content of Your email, included attached files,
			such as resumes, and other information necessary to process Your
			application.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You represent, warrant and covenant that any Personal Information that You
	supply to Sygic is true, complete and accurate in all respects. You agree to
	notify Sygic immediately of any changes to Your Personal Information via our
	Websites.</p>

	<h4>Cookie Policy</h4>

	<p>Our Websites use Cookies to allow Sygic to collect data about the visitors of
	the Websites and users of our service (that we may associate with Personal
	Information that we have collected from You) and to customise and personalise
	our Websites for its viewers. A “Cookie” is a small text file that is placed
	on Your hard disk by a web server and is used by our Websites to identify Your
	computer whenever You visit our Websites. Sygic uses Cookies to store Your
	preferences and other related information. Sygic does not use Cookies to gather
	other information from Your personal computer. Cookies can be removed by
	following Internet browser help file directions. If You choose to disable
	Cookies, some areas of the Websites may not work properly.</p>

	<h4>Information Collected Via Technology</h4>

	<p>As You navigate our Websites, certain Anonymous Information may also be
	collected passively, including Your Internet protocol address, browser type, and
	operating system. We also use Cookies and data like Uniform Resource Locators
	(URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of Your visit and the
	information for which You searched and viewed. We use this Anonymous Information
	to measure the traffic on our Websites and to help us make our Websites more
	useful. We delete this information after a period of&nbsp;time.</p>

	<p>Sygic may gather Anonymous Information from Your Sygic device when You are
	using it or when You are connecting it to a computer by using Sygic HOME. This
	Anonymous Information includes location information (information about Your
	location), information on how long it took You to travel certain routes, traffic
	patterns and on any technical glitches You may have encountered. The nature of
	the Anonymous Information that Your Sygic device transmits to us will not enable
	us to trace it back to an identifiable person; provided, however, You may elect
	to permit us to associate such Anonymous Information with Personal Information
	we have collected from You to provide You with specific location-based services
	that are tailored to meet Your needs or interests, to improve our products and
	services or to enforce the agreements, terms and conditions related to our
	Websites, products and services.</p>

	<h4>Personal Information we receive from Other Sources</h4>

	<p>We may receive Personal Information about You from third parties that provide
	us with data from their databases. We may add this information to the
	information we have already collected from You for the purposes described in
	this Privacy Policy.</p>

			companies including those based in countries within and outside the EU, for the
			purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

			<p>Sygic may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by
			excluding information (such as Your name) that makes the information personally
			identifiable to You. We may use this Anonymous Information to analyse usage
			patterns, to improve all our services, to develop new services and reserve the
			right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in its
			discretion.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>We may also use Personal Information to resolve disputes, collect fees, and

			Privacy Policy.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Our disclosure of Your information</h4>

	<p>We may disclose Personal Information to respond to legal requirements, to
	enforce our policies, to respond to claims that a listing or other content
	violates the rights of others, or to protect anyone's&nbsp;rights, property, or
	safety. Such Personal Information will be disclosed in accordance with
	applicable laws and regulations.</p>

	<h4>We may also share Your Personal Information with:</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Members of Sygic’s&nbsp;trusted complainant programme when we in our sole
			discretion believe such disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate in
			connection with an intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful
			activity. In such events, we will disclose name, street address, city, state,
			zip code, country, phone number, email address and company&nbsp;name.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified
			request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity. In

			name, city, state, zip code, telephone number, email address, user account
			history and IP address.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect Your privacy and our
			ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise
			disclose Your Personal Information to law enforcement, other government
			officials, or other third parties without an official request, court order or
			substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that
			the disclosure of Personal Information is necessary to prevent imminent physical
			harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Please note that if You access our Websites from a shared computer or a
	public computer, such as one in an internet café, certain information about
	You, such as Your user account, may be visible to other individuals who use the
	computer after&nbsp;You.</p>

	<h4>Your Choices regarding Your Personal Information</h4>

	<p>We offer You choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of Your
	Personal Information. When You receive newsletters or promotional communications
	from us, You may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications
	from us and You have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the
	unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail You receive or by contacting us
	directly at <a href="mailto:privacy@sygic.com">privacy@<!---->sygic.com</a> . However,

	regarding our products and services or notices of any updates to the terms and
	conditions or Privacy Policy. You may change any of the Personal Information in

	<h4>Accessing, reviewing and changing Your Personal Information</h4>

	<p>You can see, review and change much of Your Personal Information by signing
	in to Your Sygic account. Generally, we will not modify Your Personal
	Information because it is very difficult to verify Your identity remotely (e.g.
	via telephone). You must promptly update Your Personal Information if it changes
	or is inaccurate. Once You make a public posting, You may not be able to change
	or remove it. Upon Your request (<a href="mailto:privacy@sygic.com">privacy@<!---->sygic.com</a> ), we will
	close Your account and remove Your Personal Information from view as soon as
	reasonably possible, based on Your account activity and in accordance with
	applicable law. We do retain Personal Information from closed accounts to comply
	with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot
	problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our terms and conditions, and
	take other actions permitted by&nbsp;law.</p>

	<h4>Transfer of Business Assets</h4>

	<p>In the event that Sygic undergoes a change of control or is sold or
	transferred, or in the event that substantially all of its assets are sold or
	transferred to a third party, Sygic’s&nbsp;website, products and services, and any
	personally identifiable information collected by Sygic, will be among the
	transferred assets. By using our Websites, products and/or services, You hereby
	agree and consent to such transfer or assignment of Your Personal Information
	collected by Sygic or to a change of control of Sygic, and You further waive any
	claims that could be made against us in relation thereto.</p>

	<h4>Feedback</h4>

	<p>If You provide feedback to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose,
	provided we do not associate this feedback with Your Personal Information. Sygic
	will collect any information contained in such communication and will treat the
	Personal Information in the communication in accordance with this Privacy
	Policy.</p>

	<p>Our provision of links to other Websites or locations is for Your convenience
	and does not signify our endorsement of these other Websites, location or its
	contents. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for
