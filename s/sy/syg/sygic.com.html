<h2>Collection of Information by Sygic</h2>

<p>You may also be asked to provide Personal Information about a person other than Yourself (for example if You want to purchase a gift for someone and this Personal Information is required for the fulfilment of the delivery of Your purchase), such as name, address, email address.

<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
<p>Our Websites use Cookies to allow Sygic to collect data about the visitors of the Websites and users of our service (that we may associate with Personal Information that we have collected from You) and to customise and personalise our Websites for its viewers.

Sygic is also entitled to disclose Your Personal Information for the purposes of national security or other issues of public importance.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information and Anonymous Information are stored by Sygic in a central database. This central database is used by Sygic on a “need to know” basis in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We may also use Personal Information to resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems or to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our terms and conditions.</p>
<p>If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations for Your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Our disclosure of Your information</h2>
<p>We may disclose Personal Information to respond to legal requirements, to enforce our policies, to respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or to protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. Such Personal Information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<h2>We may also share Your Personal Information with:</h2>
<p>Members of Sygic’s trusted complainant programme when we in our sole discretion believe such disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with an intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.

<p>Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect Your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose Your Personal Information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without an official request, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of Personal Information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</p>
<p>Please note that if You access our Websites from a shared computer or a public computer, such as one in an internet café, certain information about You, such as Your user account, may be visible to other individuals who use the computer after You.</p>
