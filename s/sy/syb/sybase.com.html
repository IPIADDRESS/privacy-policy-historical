         <h1>Sybase, Inc. Online Privacy Policy</h1>
         
         <p>This statement discloses the privacy practices for
         <a href="/">www.sybase.com</a> and other Internet sites
         owned and operated by Sybase, Inc. Sybase wants to
         demonstrate its commitment to your privacy and this policy
         statement informs you about what personal information is
         gathered and tracked from this Web Site and how that
         information is used.
         
         </p><h2>Information Gathered at our Sites</h2>
         
         <p>Sybase collects personally-identifying information
         provided through optional, voluntary registration on several
         of our sites. These include:
         
         </p><ol>
            <li>trial, evaluation and beta download registration,
            
            </li><li>event registration,
            
            </li><li>support and education registration,
            
            </li><li>online purchases
            
            </li><li>contest registration
            
            </li><li>subscription registration for sites that require
            subscription
         </li></ol>
         
         <p>For contests, the information gathered in the entry form
         is used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the
         entrant an email notification that their entry has been
         received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients.
         Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all
         information about each contest is clearly posted during the
         event.
         
         </p><p>We also track the IP address of the clients from which
         people visit us and analyze this data for trends and
         statistics, but the individual users remain anonymous.
         
         </p><p>If you choose not to provide the information we request,
         you can still visit most of Sybase, Inc. web sites, but you
         may be unable to access certain options, offers, downloads
         and services. Personal information gathered at Sybase, Inc.
         web sites may be shared with third parties, such as Sybase
         partners, or for specific contest awards.
         
         </p><h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
         
         <p>What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information
         that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for
         record-keeping purposes. Their purpose is to let us know
         when you visit our site and save preferences you set. Your
         browser can be set to notify you when you are sent a cookie,
         giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.
         The information we collect and analyze is used to improve
         our service to you.
         
         </p><p>We want to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie
         in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal
         information about you. We know that a lot of people have
         concerns about cookies, but in talking with many of our
         users we feel that the benefit we both gain from their
         proper use is worthwhile. We value the relationships we have
         with our customers and future customers, so we respect these
         concerns.
         
         </p><h2>Opt-Out</h2>

         or change the information collected during registration for
