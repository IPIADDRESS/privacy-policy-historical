<body><h1>Sybase, Inc. Online Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This statement discloses the privacy practices for

<p>For contests, the information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an email notification that their entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients.
