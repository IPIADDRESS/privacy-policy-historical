    <h1>Yola, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated January 1, 2013</strong></p>
    <p>Yola is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an 
independent, organization whose mission is to build user's trust and 
confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information 
practices. This privacy statement covers the Web site www.yola.com. Because 
this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has 
agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices 
reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should 
first contact support@yola.com. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your 
inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should 
contact TRUSTe.</p>
    <p>TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your 
concerns.</p>
    <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal 
information is collected, used, and disclosed by Yola, Inc., also doing 
business as SynthaSite, Inc., and SynthaSite (Pty) Ltd. (collectively 
"Yola") with respect to your use of the web site located at 
www.yola.com (the "Site") so you can make an informed decision 
about using the Site and the web site creation and hosting services offered 
by Yola. Please note that this Policy does not apply to, and we are not 
responsible in any manner for, any information you provide to third parties 
in connection with web sites hosted by Yola ("User Sites") or how 
the third parties who operate such User Sites may use the personal 
information you provide to them. Such information is subject to the privacy 
practices of such User Site, and we encourage you to become familiar with 
their privacy practices before disclosing information directly to them. 
Registration forms contain both mandatory fields (as indicated) and 
non-mandatory fields; if you choose not to complete the mandatory fields then 
Yola may not be able to respond to your request or activate your option 
choices. By using the Yola Toolset and/or the Yola Web Site, you consent to 
any transfer of personal information, collected by Yola, outside your country 
for the purposes of storing the information where Yola and/or its agents 
maintain their facilities.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any 
material changes to the way we use your personally identifiable information, 
we will notify you here, post a new policy on our Site and update the 
“last updated” date set forth above, or by email. Therefore, we 
encourage you to check our Policy whenever you use the service to see if it 
has been updated since your last visit. Your use of the Site after the 
revised Policy has been posted will constitute your consent to such revised 
Policy. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, you 
should subscribe to our blog RSS feed at http://www.yola.com/blog or e-mail 
us at <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>. This will not 
prevent Yola from using your personal information for the administration or 
operation of the Site or other nonmarketing purposes described in this 
Policy.</p>
    <p>Our Postal Address is:</p>
    <p>201 Mission St, Suite 2250, San Francisco, CA 94105</p>
    <p>We can be reached via e-mail at <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We collect two basic types of information with our service, namely 
personal information and aggregate information. As used herein, the term 
“personal information” means information that specifically 
identifies an individual (such as a name and e-mail address), and demographic 
and other information about an individual when directly linked to personally 
identifiable information. A user name may be personal information if it 
includes personally identifying information such as a first and last name. 
Our definition of personal information does not include 
“aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect 
about a group or category of services or users from which individual user 
identities have been removed. In other words, information on how you use our 
service may be collected and combined with information about how others use 
the service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting 
data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so 
that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our service. 
This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate 
information, and we may share aggregate information about our users with 
third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand 
and improve our service, and for advertising and marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2 id="deletion-policy">Updating/Accessing/Amending Personally 
Identifiable Information</h2>
    <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no 
longer desire our service, you may update your profile or delete it by 
clicking on the Profile link after you log in and then clicking the Delete 
Account link at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, you can email our 
Customer Support at&nbsp; <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.</p>

your Google Apps™ Control Panel DOES NOT delete your Yola account. To 
delete your Yola account, please follow the instructions provided above.</p>

    <h2>Active Collection</h2>
    <p>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you 
visit our Site. We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to 
us which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect your 
name, address, email address, user name and other contact and demographic 
information when you register and set up an account or contact us by e-mail 
or other means for any reason. We may also collect payment information if 
applicable. If In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, 
contact or other personal information you voluntarily provide to us, such as

games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.</p>
    <p>For each registered user of the Site (each a "Registered

visit; Registered User-specific information on what pages Registered Users 
access or visit; and Personal information may also be collected if you leave 
comments or other communications on the Site, such as on the Yola Bulletin 
Board and/or chat areas, and/or send email directly to Yola. By doing so your 
name and the content of your communication may be made public and can be 
read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to 
send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally 
identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>As mentioned above, we automatically receive certain types of 
information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you use the Web 
site, our systems may automatically collect your IP address and the type of 
operating system or browser you use. We may also collect information 
pertaining to your account activity, and standard access information, such as 
the time and date of your accessing the service and your usage of the 
service. We use such information for purposes such as compiling aggregated 
statistics about service usage.</p>

        <li>Record session information, such as items that visitors and 
Registered Users add to their shopping cart;</li>

<a class="external" href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">Google 
advertising opt-out page.</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous 
unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a web site’s 
computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers 
automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the 
setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the 
sites you visit by editing browser options. However, if a browser is set not 
to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site 
and the service may not function properly. For example, you may not be able 
to sign in and may not be able to access certain Site features or 
services.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Cookies</h2>
    <p>The use of cookies by our partners and affiliates is not covered by 
our privacy statement. We do/do not have access or control over these 
cookies. Our partners and affiliates use session ID cookies on their websites 
once you leave Yola to give you access to Yola discounts and promotions.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the Yola 
site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot 
control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for 
any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, 
and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices 
as Yola. If you visit a third party website that is linked to from a Yola 
site, you should read that website’s privacy statement before providing 
any personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>ShareThis</h2>

you will be taken to a third party site and note that their privacy policy 
governs the collection and use of the information collected on those 
sites.</p>

    <h2>Tell-A-Friend</h2>
    <p>If you choose to use the Get Satisfaction’s referral service on 
http://forum.yola.com to share a support request about our site, Get 
Satisfaction will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. 
They will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her 
to visit the http://forum.yola.com. The Get Satisfaction referral program is 
not associated with Yola and Yola does not store or use that information.</p>

    <h2>Information about Children</h2>
    <p>Our service is not intended to be used by children under the age of 
13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 
the age of 13 except in compliance with applicable law.</p>

and our administration and operation of, the Site, newsletters and for the 
purpose for which the information was provided. We may also use the personal 
information we collect to improve the content of our Web page and to 
customize the advertising and the content and/or layout of our page for our 
visitors and individual Registered Users. We also use this information to 
notify Registered Users about updates to our Web site, and to contact 
Registered Users for marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>We will not share the personal information we collect from you through 
the Site with any other company except as provided in this Policy, as it may 
be revised form time to time. We reserve the right to disclose or transfer 
such information to a third party (a) if you request us to do so or we 
otherwise have your consent, (b) if we believe in good faith that we are 
lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably 
necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or 
authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or 
safety of Yola, our users, our employees or the public, including without 
limitation to protect Yola or our users or the public from fraudulent, 
abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Site, (c) if we believe in good 
faith that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious 
physical injury to any person, or other irreparable injury, including 
economic interests of Yola or a third party, requires disclosure of the 
information, and (d) in connection with an acquisition, merger, or sale of 
all or a substantial portion of our business.</p>
    <p>We may also share personal information with vendors, consultants and 
other service providers (“Service Providers”) who are engaged by 
or working with us in connection with the operation of the Site or the 
Services and who need access to such information to carry out their work for 
us. In some cases, the Service Provider may be directly collecting the 
information from you on our behalf. We may also share personal information 
with other third parties when you request that we do so or otherwise give us 
your express or implied consent. We are not responsible for the actions of 
Service Providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any 
additional information you provide directly to these Service Providers or 
other third parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their 
privacy practices before disclosing information directly to them. Note that 
nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregate information, which may be 
shared with third parties without your consent.</p>

    <h2>Network and Information Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized release of or access 
to your personal data. However, we cannot guarantee that your information 
will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the 
unauthorized acts of others. If Yola learns of a security systems breach, 
then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take 
appropriate protective steps. Yola may also post a notice on the Site if a 
security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal 
right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free 
written notice of a security breach, you should notify us at <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.</p>

layer technology (SSL). Credit card details are stored in our Payment 
Gateway's highly secure Payment Vault that is fully compliant with the 
Payment Card Industry's Data Security Standards.</p>
