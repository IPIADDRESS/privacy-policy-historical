<h3>Cookies and Tracking Technology</h3>
Intellisync employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor 
as a unique user. Cookies are small text files placed in the 'Cookies' folder 
on a visitor's hard disk and allow for Intellisync to remember the visitor. The 
cookies placed by the Intellisync server are readable only by Intellisync, and 
cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer. All web-browsers 
offer the option to refuse any cookie, and if a visitor refuses the Intellisync 
cookie then Intellisync does not gather any information on that visitor.<br>
<h3>Information Collected</h3>
The Intellisync system will gather information such as what kind of browser a 
visitor is on, what operating system they are using, their IP address, and their 
clickstream information (for example, which pages they have viewed and how long

is on the website in question -- in this case <a href="http://www.Intellisync.com">www.Intellisync.com</a>.

not gather information about other sites the visitor has been on.
