                <li><b><u>INFORMATION YOU GIVE US.</u></b> We collect any information you enter on the Service or give us in any other way (such as through an email, survey, or letter). The information that we collect varies depending upon how you use our Service.</li>

                <li><b><u>AUTOMATIC INFORMATION COLLECTION.</u></b>
                    <ol class="ll">
                        <li><u>Cookies.</u>  Like many websites, we use "cookies."  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser.  We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you.  While you can take steps to warn off, block or disable cookies, if you do, the Service may not function and appear as we have designed it.  Nonetheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do so by following the instructions associated with your browser.  Our cookies collection information such as:
                            <ol class="lr">

                                <li>the date and time you access the Site and pages you visit;</li>
                                <li>your computer's IP address and information about its operating system, platform and the Web browser type and version you use;</li>

                            </ol>

                        </li><li><u>Pixel Tags.</u>  In our email to your, we use "pixel tags" to determine if your email software or service can display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize the size of our email messages and conserve bandwith).</li>

                        <li><u>Collection of Information by Third Parties.</u>  Some of the advertisers and other businesses that advertise or place other content our Site use cookies on our Site and may place a cookie on your computer.

                    <ol class="ll">
                        <li><u>Your Obligations.</u>  You must protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Please sign off when finished using a shared computer. Your e-mails to us are not necessarily secure against interception so do not include sensitive information in them - we generally will not ask for passwords in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent. <b>YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.</b></li>

                        <li>Our Security Measures.

This Policy applies only to information collected by the Service.  </li>

                <li><b><u>CHOICE.</u></b>  We reserve the right to send you customary business communications such as acceptance/rejection notices regarding content submissions, general system and administrative messages, address confirmations, and transactional information about your account, and we may not offer you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such communications. However, we provide you with the opportunity to elect not to receive other types of communications, such as friend requests or the Synonym.com of the day emails. If you want to stop receiving these communications, you may opt by going to the Profile tab on the Site and editing your email preferences. </li>

                <li><b><u>ACCESS AND RECORD KEEPING.</u></b>  Information relating to our programs is not necessarily maintained in a retrievable form. However, you may make changes, corrections or updates to some PII provided through the Service which we use for communications with you, by going to the " Profile" tab on the Site. We may keep a record of all information that is changed. We may determine what may be changed.
