          data integrity, access, and enforcement.<br><br>

          sites www.liveliteintl.com.<br><br>

          We want your use of the LivElite Site and the services we offer to be productive and

          safe and we have taken great efforts to keep your information confidential and secure at

          Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and

          safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making

          informed decisions when using our site and our products and services.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Personal Information
          </h3>

          The LivElite Site collects different types of personal identifiable information (PII) such as

          name, address, email address and phone number.<br><br>

          In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our

          products and services, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information

          regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our

          products, and contact preferences.<br><br>

          Generally, you can visit the LivElite Site without entering any PII.  However, if you

          choose to place an order on the LivElite Site, we require that you provide your name,

          mailing address, billing address, email address, phone number, credit card number and

          its expiration date.<br><br>

          All of this information is necessary for us to complete the transaction and update you of

          your order status.<br><br>

          For distributors, the purpose of the LivElite Site is to manage your distributorship,

          preferred customers and network of distributors.  If you are a distributor, the LivElite Site

          allows you to order products and manage your distributorship.<br><br>

          Upon creation of distributorship you will setup a backoffice login. This login will allow

          you to access your backoffice in the future.<br><br>

          When enrolling to become a LivElite distributor and thereby obtain access to

          www.liveliteintl.com, we collect your PII, including your name, home or business

          address, telephone numbers, email address, IP address, credit card number and

          expiration date, bank account information (for direct deposit or direct debit), and various

          government-issued identifying data, including, but not limited to, your passport number,

          tax identification number, national ID card number, etc.<br><br>

          This data is necessary to manage your LivElite distributorship for purposes of identifying

          who you are, placement of your distributorship and of downline distributorships in the

          tree, compliance management, product ordering, recognition and rewards, and

          commissions calculations and payment.<br><br>

          We permit your upline to see only the following PII: your name, the country in which you

          are registered, and your sponsor’s name.<br><br>

          We permit your sponsor to see your name, email address and phone number.

          We also collect third party personal information from customers, including their name,

          address, telephone number, email address, and credit card number and expiration date.

          This PII is used to charge for product orders and ship product and for no other

          purposes.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically
          </h3>

          As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in

          log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type,

          domain type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system,

          date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Testimonials/Product Reviews
          </h3>

          For testimonials, we do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting his or her name

          and video testimonial. <br><br>

          If you enter a comment in a public forum we are not responsible for the personal

          information you choose to submit in these comments.<br><br>

          <h3>
            How We Use Your Information
          </h3>

          We may use your email address, mailing address and/or phone number to provide

          quality customer support or to reach you regarding order status, product or fulfillment

          issues and other customer service related activities.<br><br>

          We may use your email address, mailing address and/or phone number to contact you

          regarding new product offerings, special sales, newsletters, market research, and

          enforcement of the distributor contract and other aspects of your use of the LivElite Site.

          If, however, you do not wish to receive such communications, you have the ability to

          "unsubscribe" at any time and you will not be contacted further, unless you place a

          product order.  In that case, we will send you an order confirmation.

          From time to time, we may ask you to answer surveys regarding current or future

          LivElite products, as well as to determine hours worked at each rank in the

          compensation plan.  Participation in these surveys is always optional. Survey responses

          are only used in the aggregate, and are never linked to an individual.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Information Sharing and Choice
          </h3>

          LivElite International is not an "information broker.

          We do not engage in the selling of the profile, contact, web usage habits, behavior,

          buying patterns, or demographic information of our customers, partners or users.

          We use the information we collect about you to process orders, pay commissions and

          provide the best and most personalized service possible.<br><br>

          We will not use or share the PII provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones

          described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. We will also

          provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct

          marketing materials from us and we will do everything we can to honor such requests.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Agents/Service Providers
          </h3>

          We use third parties such as a shipping company to fulfill orders and a credit card

          processing company to bill you for goods and services.<br><br>

          When you purchase a product and use our site, we will share your name, address,

          telephone number, and email address as necessary for the third party to provide that

          service.<br><br>

          These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for promotional

          purposes or any other purpose aside from what is necessary to provide services to us.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Business Transition
          </h3>

          In the event LivElite goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition

          by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information

          will likely be among the assets transferred.<br><br>

          You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such

          change in ownership or control of your personal information, as well as any choices you

          may have regarding your personal information.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Legal Disclaimer
          </h3>

          In addition to the circumstances described above, LivElite may disclose or release

          information when we, in good faith, believe that doing so is reasonably necessary: (i) to

          comply with the law, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our

          Web site; (ii) to enforce or apply the terms of distributor agreement; or (iii) to protect the

          rights, property or safety of LivElite Sites, our users, or others.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Links to Other Sites
          </h3>

          This LivElite Site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by

          LivElite.<br><br>

          Please be aware that we, LivElite, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such

          other sites.<br><br>

          We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy policies

          of each and every Web site that collects personal information.<br><br>

          <b>This privacy policy applies only to information collected by this LivElite Site.</b>

          <h3>
            Tracking Information
          </h3>

          LivElite does not track users of LivElite Site online activity over time or allow other

          parties to do this on the LivElite Site.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Log Files
          </h3>

          Like most every web site, the LivElite Site records certain tracking information any time

          someone visits the site.<br><br>

          For every web page that is viewed, our web server records an IP address, the operating

          system, browser version and the name of the page that was viewed.<br><br>

          We use a third-party tracking service that uses tracking technologies to track non-

          personal information about visitors to our site.<br><br>

          This information is not linked to any specific user and is used in the aggregate to

          maintain, track performance and improve the LivElite Sites.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Cookies
          </h3>

          A cookie is a small piece of information that is stored by your browser on your

          computer's hard drive.<br><br>

          The LivElite Site uses cookies for the sole purpose of uniquely identifying our users and

          securing their personal information.<br><br>

          We also use cookies to track your order process without requiring reentry or re-

          verification of password or personal information on each page of the site.

          Rather than storing this information on LivElite's server, the cookie is stored in your

          computer and is activated only when you visit the LivElite Site.<br><br>

          Your privacy and security are not compromised when you accept a cookie from the

          LivElite Site.<br><br>

          No one can access the information except LivElite.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Third Party Tracking Technologies
          </h3>

          Some of our business partners use cookies and web beacons on our site.

          We do not have access or control over these third party trackers.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
          </h3>

          We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (aka Web Beacons/Web Bugs),

          that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.

          Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and

          are used to track the online movements of Web users.<br><br>

          In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are

          embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this

          sentence.<br><br>

          We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal

          information.<br><br>

          We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have

          been opened by recipients.<br><br>

          This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the

          effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.<br><br>

          If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “How We Use Your Information”.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Flash Cookies
          </h3>

          LivElite International site does not use Flash cookies to collect and store information.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Data Retention
          </h3>

          We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to

          provide you services and will use your information as necessary to comply with our legal

          obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Email &amp; "Unsubscribe" Policy
          </h3>

          We may use your email address provided to contact you regarding the following:<br><br>

          1. User Registration Status (including confirmation of account signup)<br><br>

          2. Order Status and Shipping Notification<br><br>

          3. Online Customer Satisfaction Survey<br><br>

          4. Major changes to the website, addition of new products or services<br><br>

          5. Promotional and marketing materials that we think you may find useful<br><br>

          If you desire not to receive information about products or services we think may be of

          interest, you can change the notification options in your account settings.<br><br>

          If you wish to not receive any of these emails, you may unsubscribe by emailing to

          support@liveliteIntl.com or by following the unsubscribe instructions within each email

          communication.<br><br>

          <h3>
            Protecting Your Personal Information
          </h3>

          LivElite is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent

          unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate

          use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and

          managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We

          place a priority on protecting your Personally Identifiable Information and take

          commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect such information.<br><br>

          The LivElite Sites use secure sockets layer (SSL) to encrypt the transfer of sensitive

          information, such as your account password and billing information including credit card,

          from your web browser to our web server.<br><br>

          Only the last four (4) digits of your credit card number will be displayed in your account.

          Emails you send to us may not be secure unless otherwise told that security measures

          will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For this reason, we ask that

          you do not send confidential information such as credit card numbers or account

          numbers to us through emails.<br><br>

          The same SSL protocol also acts to authenticate the LivElite Site and prevent

          unauthorized "Hackers" from pretending as any of our sites while you are logged in to

          your account. This is accomplished through a "digital certificate", which is an

          unforgettable electronic "identity card".<br><br>

          If another website attempts to falsely identify itself as a LivElite site, your web browser

          will display a warning indicating that there is a problem with the digital certificate for the

          LivElite Site. Do not log in to those sites if you see any such warning.<br><br>

          We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information

          submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.<br><br>

          No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%

          secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to

          protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br><br>

          If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at

          Support@liveliteintl.com<br><br>

          <h3>
            Updating Your Personal Information
          </h3>
