		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Synacor ensures that the personal information of its partners' end users will be kept safe and confidential. The following is <strong>Synacor's Privacy Policy</strong>:</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Synacor is a global technology company providing Internet solutions to enable its clients, media companies and advertisers to build close relationships with consumers on the Internet. We provide and manage web portals, email and other services (the "Services") to and for our clients (which include ISPs, computer electronics manufacturers, charities, and other companies) on their websites (the "Client Websites").  Synacor also provides advertising on its Client Websites and to third parties for their websites ("Advertising Services").</p>
<p>Synacor considers the privacy and security of the personal information of its users and its client's end users to be very important. The following Privacy Policy explains how Synacor collects and uses information a) obtained in connection with its Client Websites, b) obtained when you visit this www.synacor.com website (the "Synacor Website").</p>
<p>Synacor is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.  Because this company wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
<p>Synacor complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. The framework can be accessed here: http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact privacypolicy@synacor.com.  If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url= TRUSTe">http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url= TRUSTe</a> will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.</p>

<h3>Information Collection and Use on the Client Websites</h3>

<h4>Personal Information Collected and How We Use It.</h4>
<p>We collect personal information (which may include login, password, or other personal information) via the Client Websites when you chose to provide it to us and/or from our Clients.  In addition to personal information, you or our Client may provide demographic information (such as zip code, or age), or other information as part of registration, sign-in, completing surveys, or otherwise.  You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of the special features of the Client Websites.  Please note we do not control the personal or demographic data, we only act as a data processor of this data on behalf of our client's.  As a data processor, we will not share, sell, rent, or trade with third parties for their marketing purposes any Customer Information collected by us, unless you direct us to do so and have the appropriate authorization to do so.</p>
<p>Synacor may work with third party service providers to augment some of the information you provide on the Client Websites.  For example, if you have provided your email address via the Client Websites, we may work with a third party data company to determine your age and zip code, and add that information to our database.</p>
<p>Synacor uses the personal information provided to us in order to improve the quality of the Client Websites, provide you with customized content according to your preferences, and provide anonymous aggregate reporting for internal and external clients, including disclosing some aggregate information and user statistics to current and prospective clients, advertisers, and content partners in order to describe our services.</p>
<p>Synacor may also use e-mail addresses and other personal information to respond to users who communicate with us for support purposes or otherwise.  If users choose to correspond with Synacor through e-mail, Synacor may retain the content of the correspondences, the e-mail addresses and its responses.<br>
</p>

<h4>Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically from this Website</h4>
<p>We collect non-personally identifiable traffic data ("Non-PII") from our Client Websites. Non-PII includes, but is not limited to, information such as your IP address, web pages on the Client Websites which have been viewed by you, date and time, domain type, and the URL of the website from which you entered the Client Website.  This type of information may be collected using different types of technologies, such as cookies and web beacons. Synacor uses Non-PII to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Site. </p>
<p>Your IP address is not linked by Synacor to personally identifiable information, but it is used to gather broad demographic data and to monitor statistics to improve our Services. IP addresses are also used to provide an audit trail in the case of any attempted illegal or unauthorized use of our website or those of our clients.</p>

<h4>Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>
<p>"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk to enable saving of your website preferences, and for other record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to enjoy certain features of the Client Websites.</p>
<p>A "web beacon" consists of a small string of software code that represents an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a web site or in an e-mail.</p>
<p>Synacor uses cookies to deliver content specific to end user interests and, with user permission, to save passwords to prevent the need for you to re-enter your password each time you visit that Client Website. Synacor uses web beacons to collect anonymous data such as site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising auditing and reporting, and personalization.  Cookies and web beacons help Synacor understand, report, and enhance your experience while on the Client Websites. </p>

<h3>Advertising on the Client Websites </h3>

<h4>Information Collected on the Client Websites Related to Advertising Services</h4>
<p>Synacor provides, manages, and tracks online advertising campaigns on our Client Websites and on third party websites.  As part of this Advertising Service, Synacor may, through the use of Cookies and Web Beacons, collect aggregate data from users of such websites, including but not limited to, your IP address, the type of browser used, which of such websites have been visited, which of the ads we provided have been viewed or clicked on, and the date and time the online ads were viewed and/or clicked.  Synacor does not collect or use personal information related to the Advertising Service, and we do not merge and personal information with any of the Non-PII collected related to the Advertising Service.</p>
<p>Cookies and web beacons, as used with the Advertising Services, help Synacor understand, report, and enhance the relevance of its online advertising campaigns.  As indicated above, you can set your browser to stop accepting cookies, but in doing so you may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of many of the websites you visit.</p>

<h4>Third Parties and the Advertising Service</h4>
<p>Synacor works with advertising companies who deliver ads for us on the Client Websites or through content that is accessible via the Client Websites.  Such advertising companies may use cookies and/or web beacons to uniquely distinguish your web browser and keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown and the web pages on which the ads appeared.  Synacor may also employ web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of the promotional campaigns or other operations of the Client Websites. We do not grant any third parties the right to collect or access your personal information using web beacons, but these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. Synacor encourages you to be aware of the privacy policies of these companies before you choose to allow them to place a cookie for your web browser. Synacor has no access to or control over these third parties' cookies or web beacons. Many of them are members of the Network Advertising Initiative. For more information about the Network Advertising Initiative, and to understand your privacy choices as it pertains to these companies, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/. </p>

<h4>Opt-ing Out</h4>
<p>If you'd like to opt out from having Synacor use your Non-PII on the Client Websites for advertising purpose, please <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@synacor.com">click here</a>.  When you opt out, Synacor will place an opt-out cookie on your computer.  The opt-out cookie instructs us not to utilize your Non-PII for online ad campaigns on the Client Websites.  Please note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may opt out of receiving targeted advertising from a number of advertising companies which may be providing ads for the Client Websites by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>. </p>
<p>Please note that opting out of receiving targeted advertising or having Synacor collect Non-PII on the Client Websites will not eliminate the display of advertising on the Client Websites.  Rather, it only eliminates the use of Non-PII in determining which ads are displayed.</p>

<h3>Controlling the use of your information</h3>

<h4>Sharing of Information by Synacor.</h4>
<p>Synacor will not share, sell, rent or trade personal information collected on the Client Websites or from our Clients with third parties for promotional purposes.  We will not share your personal information with any individuals or non-affiliate companies except in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>Protection of Synacor and others: We reserve the right to disclose information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site.</p>
<p>Business Transfers: Synacor may transfer any information in our possession to any successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets that concern the Service.</p>
<p>Aggregation: Synacor may share aggregated usage and demographic information collected via the Client Websites and Services.  However, no personal information will be included in these aggregations.</p>
<p>Affiliated Business We Do Not Control: We are affiliated with a variety of businesses that jointly provide products or services with Synacor.  When an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, we will share personal information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business. </p>

<h4>Sharing Your Own Information with Others.</h4>
<p>If you choose to post comments to blogs, forums, or other editorial sections of the Client Websites, any information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of such website.  Therefore, when using blogs, forums, other editorial sections of the Client Websites, or otherwise posting information online, we urge you to think carefully about including any personal information (name, address, passwords, medical information, or otherwise) that might be used to identify you or your family members.  We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit through these features.</p>
<p>If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.</p>

<h4>Information Relating to Children</h4>
<p>Neither Synacor's Website, the Client Websites, or the Service is designed for those 13 years of age and younger. Synacor does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If the company is made aware that it has received personal information from someone under 13, it will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from its records. Children under the age of 13 should not post in any of the blogs, forums, or other editorial sections of the Client Websites or our website.</p>

<h4>Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
<p>If you are a user of our Client Websites, the information provided through those websites is owned and controlled by Synacor's client.  Please check the privacy policy on the Client Website for instructions on how to modify your personal information with the owner of that information. </p>
<p>If you are a user of Synacor's Website and would like us to update, correct, delete, or deactivate any personal information that you have provided to us on such website, please send your request to us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@synacor.com">privacypolicy@synacor.com</a> and we will process your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt. </p>

<h4>Security Procedures</h4>
<p>Synacor has implemented a variety of security measures to protect personal information received by Synacor, including containing all personal information behind its secured server network and limiting its accessibility to a limited number of authorized persons who have special access rights to such systems.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h4>Additional Information</h4>
<p>Synacor's Website and the Client Websites may contain links to other sites.  Synacor is not responsible for the privacy practices, the content or the products and services offered by such websites.  Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Synacor.  We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services.  If you visit a third party website that is linked to the Synacor Website or the Client Websites, you should read that site's privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information.</p>
