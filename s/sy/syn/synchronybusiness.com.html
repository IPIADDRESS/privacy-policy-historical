				<h1>Internet Privacy Policy</h1>
				<h2>Effective June 2014</h2>
                <p>Synchrony Bank (“SYNCB”) is committed to protecting any personal information that you may
					provide to us. In particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we treat information
					about you that we may receive from this site. Please read this Internet Privacy Policy carefully
					before using this site.</p> 
					
				<p>This Internet Privacy Policy currently is applicable only to SYNCB’s United
					States customers and visitors and only when they access and use this site, and may not be
					applicable to transactions performed and information collected in channels other than this site.
					This site is not directed to or intended for individuals under 18 years of age.</p>
					
				<p>This Internet Privacy Policy describes the types of information SYNCB collects from visitors to
					this site, what we do with this information and how visitors can update and control the use of
					information they provide on the site. This statement applies solely to information that visitors
					provide through our site. This Internet Privacy Policy does not apply to other data we collect,
					including data collected on other sites, such as separate sites operated by our Affiliates or
					business partners or other information visitors may provide to us through other means.</p>
					
					<h2>Please read this policy carefully.</h2>

					<p></p>
					<h2 id="information collected">Information Collected</h2>
					<p>There are portions of this site where we may need to collect personally identifiable information
					about you (such as your address, phone number and other information) for identification purposes
					or to fulfill your online requests. We may obtain information about you directly from you, through
					your use of our products and services and from third parties (such as credit bureaus and
					demographic firms). Any use by us of your personal information will be pursuant to the privacy
					policy provided to you in connection with your account with us.</p>
					
					<p>In addition, when you visit our site, our Web servers collect the name of the domain you used to
					access the Internet (such as aol.com), which pages on our site you visited and when they were
					visited, your Internet browser type and platform, the link that brought you to our site and any links
					clicked within our site.</p>
					
					<p>This information may be used by us, our service providers, affiliates and
					business partners to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views and other
					statistics about visitors to our site. We also use this data to monitor site performance and make the
					site easier and more convenient to use.</p>
					
					<p>Our Web servers also seek (as many Web sites do) to place a “cookie” (a small data file) on your
					computer’s hard drive which allows the server to determine the computer when it visits again in
					order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our site
					and to promotions on other sites.</p> 
					
					<p>This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal
					data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve
					site navigation and to measure the effectiveness of our site, and is not shared with anyone other
					than SYNCB affiliates and contractors who assist SYNCB in these efforts and who are bound to
					confidentiality. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject
					them or to alert you before one is placed.</p>
					
					<p>We may use a third-party technology to place our advertisements on other Web sites. This
					technology will install a small “cookie” file on your computer when you view our ad.</p> 
<!--<h2>AS</h2>-->
					<p>These cookies will not contain any information that personally identifies you (such as your name or e-mail
					address) but they will contain a randomly generated number that is unique to your browser and
					can be recognized by a “Web beacon” (transparent GIF file) on our site if you click through to our
					site from one of our ads. This allows us to keep track of how many unique visitors we have to our
					site and from what ads they entered, so that we can measure the effectiveness of our ads and ad
					placements.</p> 
					
					<p>The privacy policies of the Web sites on which we advertise, and through which the
					cookies are installed should inform you about the cookie, and you may of course set your browser
					to reject cookies.</p>
<!--<h2>AS1</h2>-->					
					<p>When you connect to us using a mobile application, we may use cookies or Web beacons and
					other methods to customize your browsing experience. If you use any location-enabled products,
					you may be sending us location information. SYNCB does not store or use this information other
					than to provide the service you requested. For example, a mobile product may use GPS data to
					find a nearby retail location. Location-enabled features are opt-in and you have control over your
					participation and can turn these services off at any time.</p>
<!--<h2>AS2</h2>-->					
					<p>Some mobile applications will utilize analytic tools to help us better serve our customers through
					improved products, services, and revisions to the mobile applications. This collected information
					does not include personally identifiable information and will not identify you to SYNCB. It may,
					however let us know, anonymously, which services and features you are using the most within the
					application, as well as device type and hardware features, country and language of download.</p>
					
					<p>In connection with the California Online Privacy Protection Act we are advising you that we do not
					respond to browser do-not-track signals. All information on who we share your data with and your
					choices are discussed in this Internet Privacy Policy.</p>
					
					<p>This Web site is not intended for persons under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or
					collect personal information from or about children under 18 and we do not knowingly market our
					products or services to children under 18.</p>
					
					<h2 id="use of info">Use of Collected Information</h2>
					
					<p>We may use information you provide us through this site to respond to your questions and
					requests; provide customer support or to provide specified services to you. Additionally, we
					may use the information you provide to contact you about updates to our service. We have
					account-specific privacy policies that we provide in connection with active accounts annually.</p>
					
					<p>Any personal information we collect on this Web site may be shared pursuant to the accountspecific
					privacy policy that governs your SYNCB account which may include service providers,
					financial institutions with whom we jointly offer financial products, our affiliates, third parties who
					are interested in offering special products or services to you or as permitted or required by law
					(such as credit bureau agencies, business we buy or sell assets from, and law enforcement or
					government agencies).</p> 
					
					<p>If you have provided us personally identifiable information in connection
					with a consumer product or service offered by SYNCB on this site, please refer to the privacy
					policy covering such product or service provided with the disclosures for such product or service
					to review any opt-out options you may have relating to the sharing of your personal information.
					</p>
					
					<h2 id="security info">Our Security Procedures</h2>
					
					<p>At SYNCB, our goal is to protect your personal information submitted to us through this site. We
					maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal
					standards to guard nonpublic personal information about you against loss, misuse or unauthorized
					access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information you have provided to us on this
					site.</p> 
					
					<p>We limit access to personal and account information to those employees and agents who
					assist us in providing products and services to you. Employees who misuse customer information
					are subject to disciplinary action. We also require third parties to whom we disclose nonpublic
					personal information to adhere to this Internet Privacy Policy and to establish information security
					procedures.</p>
					
					<p>Please note that information you send to us electronically is not necessarily secure when it is
					transmitted to us. We suggest that you do not use unsecured electronic methods to communicate
					with us if your communication is very sensitive or includes highly confidential information such as a
					Social Security Number (“SSN”) or a credit card number.</p>
					
					<p>SYNCB strives to protect the confidentiality and security of SSNs in our possession, custody or
					control by employing reasonable safeguards seeking to: (i) restrict employee access to and use of
					SSNs; (ii) prevent unauthorized third-party access to the SSNs; and (iii) prohibit unlawful disclosure
					of SSNs.</p>
					
					<h2 id="access info">Your Access to Information</h2>
					
					<p>If you do business with us, we provide you access to information about your SYNCB Account(s)
					by sending you monthly periodic statements outlining your transactions and other SYNCB Account
					information, and by providing customer service representatives to answer your questions. You may
					review and update your personal information that you provide to us through the e-servicing Web
					site of our specific products.</p>
					
					<h2 id="links other sites">Links to Other Sites</h2>
					
					<p>This Internet Privacy Policy only applies to the use and disclosure of information we collect
					from visitors online through this site. Our Web site may contain links to other sites such as other
					SYNCB Web sites and sites belonging to our business partners (who are not affiliated with us).</p>
					
					<p>While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not
					responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites. Information you
					disclose to other parties or through such sites is subject to the privacy practices and policies of
					those parties or sites.</p>
					
					<h2>International Users</h2>
					
					<p>This is a United States-based site that is subject to United States law. This site is controlled,
					operated and administered by SYNCB from its offices within the United States of America. This
					Internet Privacy Policy is provided in accordance with and subject to applicable U.S. law. If you
					decide to continue to access this site from your location outside the United States, you hereby
					agree that your use of this site is subject to this Internet Privacy Policy.</p>
					
					<h2 id="changes">Changes to this Policy</h2>
					
					<p>We reserve the right to modify or supplement this Internet Privacy Policy at any time. If we make
					any material change, we will update our site to include such changes. We recommend that you
					review this Internet Privacy Policy regularly for changes.</p>
