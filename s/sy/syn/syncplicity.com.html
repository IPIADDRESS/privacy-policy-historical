                    <h3>Collection of Information Using Cookies and Other Tools</h3>
                    
                    <p>EMC may collect and/or log your Internet Protocol address, Internet domain name, the web browser and operating system used to access EMC websites or applications, the pages or files visited, the time spent in each page or file, and the time and date of each visit or use.  EMC may collect this information automatically as you browse our websites or use our applications through the use of log files, web beacons, or other electronic tools.</p>                    
                    <p>EMC may also use cookies to automatically collect information about your use of our websites.  Cookies are text files that are sent from a website via your browser and placed on your computer's hard drive or your mobile device.  Thereafter, when you visit that website, a message is sent back to the web server by the browser accessing the website, and this information about your activities is stored in the cookie.  The information collected in cookies (e.g., the web pages you visit on the website and navigation patterns, the date and time of your visit, the number of links you click within the site, the functions you use on the site, the databases you view and the searches you request on the site, the data you save on, or download from, the site, the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting the site, and when you open our e-mails or click on any of their links) is used and analyzed to improve our service to you and to personalize your web-browsing experience by providing EMC with a better understanding of your interests and requirements regarding our websites and applications.  Cookies may be linked to your personal information, such as your e-mail address or password.</p>                     
                    <p>We may also use cookies and other electronic tools placed by a third-party service provider to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and other information and to help us understand what product information is of most interest to you and what kinds of advertising offers you like to see.  Although the service provider logs the information coming from our websites or applications on our behalf, EMC controls how that data may and may not be used.  If you do not want to assist EMC in improving our products, offers, and marketing strategy, you can opt out of this website analysis tool with respect to mobile applications and EMC.com by clicking here: <a href="http://ecn-analytics-nssl.emc.com/optout.html" target="_blank">http://ecn-analytics-nssl.emc.com/optout.html</a>.  Websites of EMC subsidiaries or divisions may use similar tracking tools for similar internal business purposes only.  These websites may not offer this opt-out functionality.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving targeted ads for any other EMC websites covered by the TRUSTe program, you may opt out by <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.  Please note this may not opt you out of being served generic advertising.  You may also elect not to accept cookies by changing the designated settings on your web or mobile browser.  Or you can set your browser to notify you when you are being sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.  The help function on most browsers contains instructions on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies, or disable cookies entirely.  However, disabling cookies in either manner may prevent you from using certain functions and features of websites, and the advertising you receive when you visit the site may not be advertisements tailored to your interests.</p>    
                    <p>We or third-party advertisers or their advertising servers may also place or recognize unique cookies on your computer or use other electronic tools in order to help display advertisements that you see on our websites.  Information about your visits to, and activity on, our websites, an IP address, the number of times you have viewed an advertisement, and other such usage information is used, alone or in combination with other information, to display on your computer screen advertisements that may be of particular interest to you.  The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and their advertising servers is not covered by this Privacy Statement.</p>  
                    <p>To opt out of advertising cookies placed by the Network Advertising Initiative’s ("NAI") member networks, and thereby limit the tracking of your online activity and the tailored advertising you receive, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">click here</a>.  Note that even if you opt out of cookies placed by such member networks and participating companies, you may still receive online advertising.</p>

                    <p>We may disclose information that does not identify any individual (e.g., anonymous, aggregated data) without restriction.</p>
                    <p>EMC contracts with third-party service providers and suppliers (including distributors and resellers) to deliver certain products, services, and customer solutions.  Examples of such services provided on our behalf are mail delivery, website hosting, transaction processing, processing payments, sending emails on our behalf, provide you with support via live chat software, and event planning.  EMC may share your personal information with its service providers and suppliers to the extent necessary to deliver the product or service you requested, respond to your requests for information on products or services, or otherwise support your business needs.  You will not have the opportunity to opt out of having your information shared with these third-party service providers and suppliers for these purposes, and they may contact you directly in connection with such purposes.</p>
                    <p>Third-party service providers and suppliers receiving personal information are expected to maintain privacy and security protections that are consistent with EMC’s privacy and information security policies.  These companies are authorized to use your personal information only for the purpose for which it was originally intended or as required or permitted by law.  However, unless otherwise dictated by law or agreement, EMC is not responsible for any improper use by such parties.</p>
                  <p>We may also disclose your personal information and other information, including across country borders: </p>
                  <ul class="disc-space">
                      <li>to our  subsidiaries, affiliates, and worldwide offices,</li>
                      <li>to  third parties for their own use, such as to provide you with special offers and  promotions that may be of interest to you, </li>
                      <li>to  share data about web visitors with third-parties for the third parties’ own  analytics, reporting, or general advertising purposes, </li>
                      <li>to  comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, law enforcement  or government request, or other legal process,</li>
                      <li>to  produce relevant documents or information in connection with litigation, arbitration,  mediation, adjudication, government or internal investigations, or other legal  or administrative proceedings,</li>
                      <li>if EMC determines in its good faith judgment that  such disclosure is necessary to provide its services or to protect the rights,  interests, safety, or property of its business, employees, suppliers,  customers, or others, </li>
                      <li>in  connection with any proposed or actual sale or other transfer of some or all  assets of EMC, and/or any proposed or actual sale or merger of EMC or any  division of EMC, </li>
                      <li>to enforce the terms of any agreement with EMC,</li>
                      <li>to combat fraud or other criminal activity, </li>
                      <li>for any other purpose disclosed by us when you  provide the information, </li>
                      <li>as  otherwise required or permitted by law, and/or </li>
                      <li>with  your consent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some EMC websites or services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company.  If you register for or use such websites/services, both EMC and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded website/services.</p>
                    <p>Unless permitted by relevant laws, EMC will not share, sell, trade, or lease your personal information to or with others except as provided for in this Privacy Statement. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Your Marketing Choices, Right to Access Your Personal Information, and Our Retention of Your Personal Information</h3>
                    
                    <p><u>Your Marketing Choices.</u> Your decision to provide the personal information that we may request from time to time is voluntary.  However, if you do not provide the personal information requested, you may not be able to proceed with the activity or receive the benefit for which the personal information is being requested.</p>
                    <p>You can unsubscribe or choose not to receive promotional materials from EMC (or from specific divisions or subsidiaries) by following the specific instructions in the e-mail or other communication you receive or by notifying us via the appropriate method(s) described below depending on which website or service is at issue.  It may take a reasonable period of time to process your request, but no longer than 30 days for direct mail and telephone promotions and 10 business days for e-mail promotions.  In countries where EMC is required to do so by law, EMC will offer you the opportunity to provide opt-in consent before promotional materials are sent, or promotional calls are made, to you.  This will not apply to service communications that are considered part of certain EMC services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the applicable service.  To opt out of receiving marketing emails from a third-party partner, please follow the unsubscribe instructions in the email you receive from the partner or contact the partner directly.  To opt out of having EMC share your personal information with a third-party partner for their own marketing use, please contact us at <a href="mailto:emarketing@emc.com">emarketing@emc.com</a>.</p>
                    <p><u>Your Access to Your Personal Information.</u>  EMC strives to keep your personal information accurate.  We have implemented technology, management processes, and policies to maintain data integrity.  We will provide you with reasonable access to your personal information in accordance with relevant laws, including by making reasonable efforts to provide you with online access and the opportunity to update your information.  To protect your privacy and security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting access or making changes to your personal information.  To request access to your personal information, follow the applicable instructions below depending on which website or service is at issue.  While we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your request, we also reserve the right to reject such access requests or to impose certain restrictions and requirements on such requests, if required or permitted by applicable law.  We will respond to requests for access within 30 days.</p>
                    <p><u>Our Retention of Your Information.</u>  We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  If you wish to cancel your account, or request that we no longer use your personal information to provide you services, contact us via the applicable information provided below.  Even after we cancel your account or cease using your personal information to provide you services, we may still retain, use, and disclose your information as necessary to comply with our legal, regulatory, ethical, or document retention obligations, and any request to delete your personal information is subject to these obligations and restrictions.</p>

EMC does not control these third-party websites or their privacy practices, which may differ from EMC's.  We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites.

                    <p>EMC has implemented reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, alteration, or destruction.  When you provide us with credit card information via an EMC website, we will encrypt that information via SSL.

EMC will not request your personal information through e-mail.  If you have questions regarding our security you can contact us via <a href="mailto:general_counsel@emc.com">general_counsel@emc.com</a>. </p>
