<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span class="note">*Some products and services offered by these companies may be subject to separate privacy policies. This policy will apply to your relationships with the companies unless you are notified otherwise.</span>&nbsp;<span class="mainNav"></span>&nbsp;<span class="mainNav"></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Collecting Information: Categories of Non Public Information</strong></p>
<p>In the process of serving you, we obtain certain “non-public personal information” -- information about you that is not available publicly. This information comes to us from a variety of sources: </p>
<ul>
<li>You or someone acting on your behalf, on forms, via the Internet, by telephone or otherwise. Examples of this type of information include your name, address, Social Security number, credit history and other financial information. 
</li><li>Transactions with us, our affiliates or with others. For example, your payment histories, account balances, and other transaction records. 
</li><li>Credit reporting agencies. For example, information relating to your creditworthiness, your credit score and credit usage. 
</li><li>Third parties to verify information you have given us.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong><br>Safeguarding Information</strong></p>
<p>We have incorporated policies and procedures designed to keep any information you provide us safe. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that we believe comply with applicable legal and regulatory standards to keep this information private and secure. Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services that will have access to customer information, we require them to conform to our privacy requirements and to allow us to audit them for compliance. We restrict access to personal information about you to those employees we believe need to know that information to provide products and services to you.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Information</strong> </p>
<p>We want you to know that we limit the collection and sharing of information to what we believe is necessary to serve you and administer our business. We may share all the information that we collect as described above in the categories of nonpublic information:</p>
<ul>
<li>As permitted or required by law 
</li><li>With companies that perform marketing services on our behalf 
</li><li>With related companies listed in this notice to meet your needs or deliver added savings or convenience to you 
</li><li>With unrelated companies that may provide you with special offers related to their products and services. 
</li><li>For identification purposes to protect your accounts and guard against unauthorized access </li></ul>
<p>You may have other privacy rights in some states, such as Vermont and California. To the extent state laws apply, we will comply with them when we share information about you. </p>
<p>If at any time you become an inactive customer or close your account(s), we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice. However, we will not send you an annual notice.</p>
<p><strong>Your Privacy Preferences</strong> </p>
<p>If you wish to direct Synovus to stop sharing certain nonpublic personal information about you with nonaffiliated third parties or among our affiliates, please call 1-800-695-0987 (toll free) to opt-out. You will be prompted to select one of the options listed below.</p>
<p>The toll-free telephone number is the only authorized means to inform us of your decision not to share information. Your selection will apply to all Synovus companies listed in this notice. If a joint account customer chooses not to allow disclosure of this information, the decision will apply to the entire joint account. </p>
<p>If you are comfortable with the Synovus privacy policy and your current privacy preferences you do not need to contact us unless you are establishing a new customer relationship with us. Your previous choice will remain in force until you tell us otherwise.</p>
<p><strong><u>Option 1: Directs Synovus not to share nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, except as permitted by law.</u></strong></p>
<p>Choosing this option directs Synovus not to share nonpublic personal information about you with nonaffiliated third parties, except as permitted by law. Exceptions include sharing information within the Synovus family of companies, with companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements, other nonaffiliated service providers, and credit reporting agencies to whom we report information on your transactions with us.</p>
<p><strong><u>Option 2: Directs Synovus not to share certain nonpublic information about you within the Synovus family of companies, except as permitted by law.</u></strong> </p>
<p>Choosing this option directs Synovus not to share credit information about you within the Synovus family of companies, except as permitted by law. You will continue to receive mailings and advertisements from the Synovus companies with which you do business. Banks and other financial service providers within our Synovus family may share among ourselves the information we collect about your identity, your transactions, or other information within our affiliated family.</p>
<p><strong><u>Option 3: Directs Synovus not to share nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties or among its affiliates, except as permitted by law.</u></strong></p>
<p>Choosing this option directs Synovus to limit disclosure of information with outside companies and within the Synovus family of companies as outlined in Options 1 and 2, respectively.</p>
<p><strong><u>Option 4: Allows disclosure of information within the Synovus family and unrelated companies.</u></strong> </p>
<p>Choosing this option allows Synovus to disclose information about you within the Synovus family and with unrelated companies. This will reverse any previous elections you have made to limit disclosure. If you are currently allowing disclosure, there is nothing you need to do. </p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding our privacy policies or procedures, please contact the compliance officer of the Synovus company where you are a customer. </p>
<p>If you are a customer of more than one Synovus company or if you have multiple accounts with us, you may receive more than one notice. </p>
<p><strong>June 2008. This notice supersedes any previous privacy statement issued. We reserve the right to modify or add to the policy at any time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Choice to Limit Use of Information for Marketing</strong> </p>
<p>The Synovus companies listed in this policy are providing this notice. </p>
<p>You may limit Synovus companies, such as Synovus banking and other affiliates, from marketing their products or services to you based on credit or transaction information about you that they receive from other Synovus companies. This information includes your account balance, payment history, and your credit history. </p>
<p>However, when you choose this option to limit the use of this information by other Synovus companies to market their products and services, to you, your choice does not apply to any Synovus company that has an existing business relationship with you or where the use is otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<p>Your choice to limit such marketing offers from Synovus companies will apply until you tell us to change your choice. If a joint account customer chooses not to allow disclosure of this information, the decision will apply to the entire joint account. </p>
<p>If you have already made a choice to limit such marketing offers from Synovus companies, you do not need to act again. </p>
<p>To limit such marketing offers please call 1-800-695-0987 (toll free).</p>
