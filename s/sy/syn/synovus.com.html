		<p>Our most important asset is our customers’ trust. Keeping customer 
		information secure and using it only as our customers would want us 
		to is a top priority for us.</p>

		<p><b>Here is our covenant to you, our customer:</b></p>

		<ol>
			<li>We have never sold and will never sell information about you 
			to anyone for any reason.</li>
			<li>We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security 
			and confidentiality, any information you provide to us.</li>
			<li>We will limit the collection and use of your information to 
			the minimum required to deliver superior service. This includes 
			the chance for us to design and offer you specific products, 
			services and other opportunities that would benefit you.</li>
			<li>We will permit only authorized team members who are trained 
			in the proper handling of customer information to have access to 
			your information. This means only team members who need to know 
			information to provide products and services to you will be 
			allowed access.</li>
			<li>We will tell you in plain language, initially and at least 
			once every year while you are a customer, what information we 
			collect from you, where we obtain that information and how we 
			plan to use it. As discussed later, you have several choices 
			(which you may select at any time) on how you would like for us 
			to manage your information.</li>
			<li>In addition to restricting access to customer information, 
			we also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards 
			that comply with applicable legal standards to keep your 
			information private and secure.</li>
			<li>We will not use or disclose --- internally or externally – 
			personally identifiable medical information for any purpose other 
			than underwriting or administration of your insurance policy, 
			claim or account, or as disclosed to you when the information is 
			collected, or to which you consent.</li>
			<li>We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of 
			information; even on those occasions when we allow offers to be 
			made from reputable outside companies.</li>
			<li>Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support 
			services, we will require them to conform to our privacy 
			requirements and to allow us to audit them for compliance.</li>
			<li>For purposes of credit reporting, verification and risk 
			management, we will exchange information about you with reputable 
			reference sources and clearing house services.</li>
		</ol>

		<p><b>We care about your privacy.</b></p>

		<p>Guarding our customers’ privacy has always been one of our highest 
		priorities. In order to protect you, the information we maintain about 
		your relationship with us helps us identify you and prevent 
		unauthorized persons from getting information about you or your 
		accounts.</p>

		<p>We are also dedicated to serving your needs. One way we do this is 
		by providing you with information that may help you manage your 
		finances; for example, the availability of new or upgraded products 
		and services and special offers such as credit line increases or rates 
		which are being promoted for a limited time. We believe communicating 
		these opportunities can result in advantages for you such as:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Increased convenience</li>
			<li>Improved personalized service</li>
			<li>Real savings of time and money</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>In order to deliver these benefits to you, we may need to disclose 
		the information we collect about you (as described below). Therefore, we 
		want you to understand what information we collect and how it is 
		used.</b></p>

		<p><b>We collect and disclose only information that is necessary to serve 
		you and administer our business.</b></p>

		<p>In the process of serving you, we obtain certain "non-public 
		personal information" --- information about you that is not available 
		publicly. This information comes to us from a variety of sources, 
		including:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Information you provide directly to us on applications, other forms 
			or otherwise (such as Social Security Number, assets and income).
			<br>&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Information related to your transactions with us (such as account 
			balance, payment history, and credit card usage) or with others.
			<br>&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Information we receive from third parties (such as consumer reporting 
			agencies or credit or employment references).<br>&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Information obtained at your request (such as aggregated information 
			from multiple financial providers for the purpose of developing a 
			financial profile or plan for you).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We limit the collection and use of this information to that which is 
		needed to administer our business and to provide superior service to you.</p>

		<p>How we use information about you:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>For identification purposes to protect your accounts and guard 
			against unauthorized access.<br>&nbsp;</li>
			<li>To better serve you and to identify additional products and 
			services that may help meet your needs or that will result in added 
			savings or convenience to you.<br>&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Only in accordance with the principles stated in this covenant.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Additional information about disclosures:</p>

		<p>Additionally, we may disclose non-public personal information we collect 
		as described above as permitted or required by law to non-affiliated third 
		parties who perform administrative functions on our behalf such as 
		processing your accounts or preparing your account statements. We may also 
		disclose this non-public personal information to non-affiliated third 
		parties where necessary to conduct business, such as companies performing 
		services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have 
		joint marketing agreements. We will not, however, sell or provide your 
		information to telemarketing companies for their independent use.</p>

		<p><b>Your choices regarding information disclosure</b></p>

		<p>We are committed to protecting your information and to using it in ways 
		that will improve our service to you. We also want you to know that you have 
		choices about how your information may be disclosed.</p>

		<p><b>If you are comfortable with the promises that are discussed in this 
		covenant and will allow us to exchange information about you as outlined, 
		then you do not need to contact us.</b></p>

		<p>If you would prefer to limit disclosure of your information, please 
		see the options below.</p>

		<p><u><b>Option 1:</b> Do Not Disclose With Outside Companies</u></p>

		<p>We may disclose non-public personal information about you with companies 
		not part of our corporate family. Examples of such organizations would be 
		companies for whom we issue private label or affinity credit cards and 
		financial services providers such as insurance companies or non-financial 
		companies with whom we have formed an alliance to provide special services 
		to our customers; such as airlines, publishers, retailers.</p>

		<p><i>If you prefer that this information about you <b>not</b> be disclosed 
		with non-affiliated third parties (other than as permitted or required by 
		law), you must notify us by calling the following toll-free number: 
		1 (800) 695-0987 --- and selecting Option 1. Choosing this option would 
		still allow us to disclose within the Synovus family of companies 
		described below.</i></p>


		<p><b>If disclosure of this information is permissible, you do not need to 
		contact us.</b></p>

		<p><u><b>Option 2:</b> Do Not Disclose Within the Synovus Family of 
		Companies</u><br>
		(to include the companies listed in this notice, Synovus Trust Companies 
		and companies who may join us in the future)</p>

		<p>It is possible that the banks and other financial service provider 
		companies (such as mortgage, securities and insurance companies) within 
		our Synovus family would exchange the information we collect about you 
		(as described above) among themselves for the purposes listed above. Our 
		trust companies would participate only on a limited basis, primarily 
		receiving information.</p>

		<p><i>If you prefer that this information <b>not</b> be disclosed with 
		companies in our corporate family, you must notify us by calling the 
		following toll-free number: 1 (800) 695-0987 --- and selecting Option 
		2. Choosing this option still allows us to disclose with non-affiliated 
		third parties discussed above. Also, even though you have selected this 
		option, there is certain information such as your transactions and our 
		experiences with you that we may share as permitted by law.</i></p>

		<p><b>If disclosure of this information is permissible, you do not need 
		to contact us.</b></p>

		<p><u><b>Option 3</b>: Do Not Disclose With Either the Synovus Family or 
		Outside Companies</u></p>

		<p><i>As outlined in Options 1 and 2, if you prefer that information 
		about you <b>not</b> be disclosed with banks or companies within the 
		Synovus family nor with non-affiliated third parties (other than as 
		permitted or required by law), you must notify us by calling the 
		following toll-free number: 1 (800) 695-0987 --- and selecting 
		Option 3.</i></p>

		<p><b>If disclosure of this information is permissible, you do not need 
		to contact us.</b></p>

		<p><u>Additional information about your choices</u></p>

		<p>As you can see, you have choices about our disclosure of information 
		about you.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>You may choose to allow us to exchange such information (under 
			strict confidentiality standards). If you choose this option, <b>you 
			don’t need to do anything</b>.<br><br>
			You could also choose to allow us to disclose information within 
			our corporate family while choosing not to allow us to disclose with 
			companies outside our corporation. (Your selection in this example 
			would be Option 1.)<br>&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Once your request has been processed, it will remain in effect 
			until you request a change. You may request a change at any time 
			throughout the year by calling us toll-free at 1 (800) 695-0987 and 
			selecting the option that reflects your choice.<br>&nbsp;</li>
			<li>If a joint account customer chooses not to allow disclosure of 
			this information, that decision will apply to the entire joint 
			account.<br>&nbsp;</li>
			<li>In order to protect your choice and to maximize our ability to 
			administer your choice, the toll-free telephone number will be the 
			only authorized means to inform us of your decision not to disclose 
			information.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>If at any time you become an inactive customer or close your account(s), 
		we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described 
		in this notice.</p>

		<p>Our commitment to you is to handle your financial matters with discretion, 
		treating them as if they were our own. If you have any questions regarding 
		our privacy policies or procedures, please contact the compliance officer of 
		the appropriate Synovus company where you are a customer. (Please note: if 
		you are a customer of more than one Synovus company or if you have multiple 
		accounts with us, you may receive more than one notice.)</p>
		
		<p>Please note: Third parties may have access to information related to our 
		customers that has been obtained independently from us (for example: through 
		credit rating agencies or public real estate records). Mailings or 
		solicitations based on this information are not within our control.</p>

		<p>March 2001. This covenant supersedes any previous privacy statement issued.</p>
