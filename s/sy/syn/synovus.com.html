	<hr size="1" color="black" noshade="">
	<p><span class="titleSmall">Synovus Customer Covenant and Privacy Policy 2004</span> </p>
<p><strong>Our Customer Covenant</strong></p>
<p>We pledge to serve every customer with the highest levels of sincerity, fairness, courtesy, respect and gratitude, delivered with unparalleled responsiveness, effectiveness, efficiency and accuracy. We are in business to create lasting relationships, and we will treat our customers like we want to be treated. We will offer the finest personal service and products delivered by caring team members who take 100% responsibility for meeting the needs of each customer.</p>
<p>We care about your privacy.</p>
<p><br>The principles outlined in our customer covenant are reinforced in our privacy policy, which is our commitment to keep information about you safe and secure. Our privacy policy and your choices regarding the disclosure of this information are outlined below. (A list of companies covered by this policy is available at the end of this document.)</p>
<p>Our most important asset is our customers’ trust. Keeping information about you secure and using it only as you would want us to is a top priority for us.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a brief summary of our privacy policy</strong></p>
<p>1) We have never sold and will never sell information about you to anyone for their independent use.</p>
<p><br>2) We will safeguard any information you provide to us, keeping it secure and confidential.</p>
<p><br>3) We will limit the collection and use of information about you to the minimum we believe is required to deliver superior service. This includes the chance for us to design and offer you specific products, services and other opportunities that might benefit you: i.e. save you time and money, result in increased convenience, help you manage your finances or improve personalized service.</p>
<p><br>4) We will permit only authorized team members who are trained in the proper handling of customer information to have access to information about you. This means only team members whom we determine need to know information to provide products and services to you will be allowed access.</p>
<p><br>5) In addition to restricting access to information about you, we also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable legal and regulatory standards to keep this information private and secure.</p>
<p><br>6) We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of information; even on those occasions when we allow offers to be made from reputable outside companies.</p>
<p><br>7) Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services who will have access to customer information, we will require them to conform to our privacy requirements and to allow us to audit them for compliance.</p>
<p><br>8) For purposes of credit reporting, verification and risk management, we will exchange information about you with reputable reference sources and clearing house services.</p>
<p><br>9) We will tell you in plain language, initially and at least once every year while you are a customer, what information we collect from you, where we obtain that information and how we plan to use it. <br><br>As discussed in this policy, you have several choices (which you may select at any time) of how you would like for us to manage information about you.</p>
<p><strong>Protecting your privacy…our privacy policy. </strong></p>
<p>It is important to us that you understand what information we collect about you and how it is used. We want you to know that we limit the collection and disclosure of information only to that which we believe is necessary to serve you and administer our business. </p>
<p><strong>Collecting Information</strong></p>
<p>In the process of serving you, we obtain certain "non-public personal information" --- information about you that is not available publicly. This information comes to us from a variety of sources, including:</p>
<p>• Information you provide directly to us (or is provided to us on your behalf) on applications, other forms or otherwise (such as Social Security Number, assets and income).</p>
<p>• Information related to your transactions with us (such as account balance, payment history, and credit card usage) or with others.</p>
<p>• Information we receive from third parties (such as consumer reporting agencies or credit or employment references).</p>
<p>• Information obtained at your request (such as aggregated information from multiple financial providers for the purpose of developing a financial profile or plan for you).</p>
<p><strong>Using that Information </strong></p>
<p>We may disclose all the information that we collect as follows:</p>
<p>• With affiliated companies listed in this notice in order to offer you additional products and services, such as banking, insurance or mortgages, that help meet your needs or that will result in added savings or convenience to you.</p>
<p>• As permitted or required by law, for example: to process your accounts, prepare your account statements or to respond to subpoenas or similar legal requests as well as requests from law enforcement agencies or state and federal banking regulators.</p>
<p>• To companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, for example, financial companies such as banks and insurance companies; non-financial companies such as direct marketers and mail houses; and others such as membership organizations or to other financial institutions under joint marketing agreements, such as insurance companies, banks and securities broker-dealers. </p>
<p>• To unaffiliated non-financial companies -- such as retailers, airlines, non-profit organizations, etc. -- who may provide you with special offers related to their products and services.</p>
<p>• For identification purposes to protect your accounts and guard against unauthorized access.</p>
<p>• Only in accordance with the principles stated in this covenant.</p>
<p>We will not, however, sell or provide information about you to telemarketing companies for their independent use. We will also not use or disclose---internally or externally---personally identifiable medical information for any purpose other than underwriting or administering your insurance policy, claim or account, or as disclosed to you when the information is collected or to which you consent. We will comply with applicable state and local laws that may restrict the types of information we may disclose about you or require us to provide you with additional notices.</p>
<p><strong>You have choices regarding information disclosure.</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to protecting information about you and to using it in ways that will improve our service to you. We also want you to know that you have choices about how your information may be disclosed.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with the promises that are discussed in this policy and will allow us to exchange information about you as outlined, then you do not need to contact us ---- unless you have previously selected Options 1, 2, or 3 and want to make a change to that selection. </p>
<p>Your selection will apply to all Synovus companies listed in this notice.</p>
<p>If you have previously called in a selection and want to keep that same selection, then there is nothing you need to do. Your previous choice will remain in force until you tell us otherwise.</p>
<p>If you would prefer to change the selection you made previously or limit disclosure of information about you, please see the options below.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: Limiting Disclosure With Outside Companies</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose non-public personal information we collect about you with companies not part of our corporate family. Examples of such organizations would be non-financial companies with whom we have formed an alliance to provide special services to our customers, such as airlines, publishers, retailers. Just a reminder: we do not sell information about you to outside companies for their independent use and we require explicit standards of security and confidentiality when we enter into agreements with outside companies.</p>
<p>If you prefer that this information about you not be disclosed with non-affiliated third parties, you must notify us by calling the following toll-free number: 1-800-695-0987 --- and selecting Option 1 when prompted. Choosing this option would still allow us to disclose within the Synovus family of companies described below and with non-affiliated third parties where necessary to conduct business (such as companies performing marketing services on our behalf),with other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements or as permitted or required by law.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2: Limiting Disclosure Within the Synovus Family of Companies </strong>(to include the companies listed in this notice, Synovus Trust companies and companies who may join us in the future) </p>
<p>Banks and other financial service providers (such as mortgage, securities and insurance companies) within our Synovus family may use the information we collect about you among ourselves, which could include information such as credit information. Our trust companies would participate only on a limited basis, primarily receiving information.</p>
<p>If you prefer that this information not be disclosed with companies in our corporate family, you must notify us by calling the following toll-free number: 1-800-695-0987 --- and selecting Option 2 when prompted. Choosing this option still allows us to disclose information to non-affiliated third parties discussed above. If you have selected this option, we may continue to share within the Synovus family certain information about our experiences or transactions with you or your accounts as permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>Option 3: Limiting Disclosure With Outside Companies and Within the Synovus Family</strong></p>
<p>If you would prefer to limit disclosure of information with outside companies as outlined in Option 1 AND limit disclosure of information within the Synovus family of companies as outlined in Option 2, you must notify us by calling the following toll-free number: 1-800-695-0987 --- and selecting Option 3 when prompted.</p>
<p><strong>Option 4: Disclosure Within the Synovus Family and With Outside Companies is Permissible</strong></p>
<p>This option allows disclosure of information about you within the Synovus family and with non-affiliated third parties. If you are currently allowing disclosure, there is nothing you need to do. If you have previously chosen Options 1, 2 or 3 and would like to change to this choice, you must notify us by calling the following toll-free number: 1-800-695-0987 --- and selecting Option 4 when prompted.</p>
<p>Additional information about your choices</p>
<p>As you can see, you have choices about our disclosure of information about you.</p>
<p>• You may choose to allow us to exchange such information under strict confidentiality standards. If you choose this option, you don’t need to do anything --- unless you have previously chosen Options 1, 2 or 3. If you have selected another option in the past, you will need to call 1-800-695-0987 and select Option 4.</p>
<p>You could also choose to allow us to disclose information within our corporate family while choosing not to allow us to disclose with companies outside our corporation. (Your selection in this example would be Option 1.)</p>
<p>• Once your request has been processed, it will remain in effect until you request a change. You may request a change at any time throughout the year by calling us toll-free at 1-800-695-0987 and selecting the option that reflects your choice.</p>
<p>• If a joint account customer chooses not to allow disclosure of this information, that decision will apply to the entire joint account. </p>
<p>• In order to protect your choice and to maximize our ability to administer your choice, the toll-free telephone number will be the only authorized means to inform us of your decision not to disclose information.</p>
<p>• If your billing address is Vermont, California or Illinois, you are automatically opted-out of Synovus information sharing practices that are otherwise not permitted by your state’s law. No further action by you is necessary.</p>
<p>If at any time you become an inactive customer or close your account(s), we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice. However, we will not send you an annual notice.</p>
<p>Please note: Third parties may have access to information related to our customers that has been obtained independently from us (for example: through credit rating agencies or public real estate records). Mailings or solicitations based on this information are not within our control.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding our privacy policies or procedures, please contact the compliance officer of the appropriate Synovus company where you are a customer. If you are a customer of more than one Synovus company or if you have multiple accounts with us, you may receive more than one notice.</p>
<p>June 2004. This covenant supersedes any previous privacy statement issued. We reserve the right to modify or add to the policy at any time.</p>
