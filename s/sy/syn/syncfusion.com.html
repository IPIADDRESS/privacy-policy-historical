not access or use this Site. You can browse through most of our website without giving us

you take a moment to read our online privacy policy.</p>

<h4>Personal Information</h4>
<p>
"Personal information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be
used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains
such as first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address,
employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers. When
ordering products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit
card number.
</p>

<h4>Technical Information</h4>
<p>When you use the Site, Syncfusion or third parties authorized by Syncfusion
may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer
to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log
environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed,
and the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer. We use these
environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and its
services. Syncfusion also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic
patterns on the Site. Without expressly informing you in each particular
circumstance, we do not match such information with any of your personal
information.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>When you visit this Site, you can browse the Site and access important
information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our Site, we use
"cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is a small amount of data that is
transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server
that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, and enables
Syncfusion to record your passwords, purchases, and preferences. It cannot be
executed as code or deliver viruses. Most browsers are initially set to accept
cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie,
giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. (For some Web pages that
require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept
cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.) While Syncfusion uses
cookies to track your visit to Syncfusion.com, and our Web servers
automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, Syncfusion does not
use this information to identify you personally.</p>

<h4>Who collects it</h4>
<p>
Personal information on this Site is collected by Syncfusion Incorporated.
Syncfusion's address is 1157 Executive Circle, Suite C, Cary, NC 27513 and its
telephone number is (919) 460-6404.
</p>
<p>
The Site contains links to other sites at which personal information is collected.
In such instances, unless expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and
use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy
applicable to that site. That privacy policy should identify the entity that is
collecting your personal information.
</p>

<h4>When and how is Personal Information collected</h4>
<p>
Syncfusion collects your information in order to record and support your
participation in the activities you select. If you subscribe to a service or register a
product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to
technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered
users. As another example, if you enter a contest, information is collected to
qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Your
personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades,
special offers, and other products and services of Syncfusion.
</p>
<p>
Syncfusion may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling
out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in
these activities. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we
ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do
not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not
be able to engage in that activity.

<h4>How is the collected information protected</h4>
<p>
The personal information that you provide in connection with registering
yourself as a user of Syncfusion products or services or registering an
Syncfusion product is classified as Registration Information. Registration
Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your Registration
Information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by
you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your
password to anyone. In addition, your Registration Information resides on a
secure server that only selected Syncfusion personnel and contractors have
access to via password. Syncfusion encrypts your personal information and
thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information
when it is transmitted to Syncfusion.
</p>
<p>
Personal information that you provide that does not constitute Registration
Information also resides on a secure server and is only accessible to selected
Syncfusion personnel and contractors via password. Since this information is not
accessible by you, you will not be asked to select a password in order to view or
modify such information. Within Syncfusion, only authorized support personel
and executives have access to your personal information.
</p>
<p>
Please note that any information you post to a public bulletin board or chat
room, such as the Syncfusion User to User Forums (the "Forums"), is available
to all persons accessing that location. Your e-mail address would then be available to all persons accessing the
Forums.</p>
<p>
Syncfusion recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of
information collected on this Site. Without your consent, Syncfusion will not
communicate any information to you regarding products, services, and special
offers available from Syncfusion, although we may find it necessary to
communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this Site. Except in
the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Syncfusion will
also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your
consent.
</p>
<p>
There are other instances in which Syncfusion may divulge your personal
information. Syncfusion may provide your personal information if necessary, in
Syncfusion's good faith judgment, to comply with laws or regulations of a
governmental or regulatory body or in response to a valid subpoena, warrant, or
order or to protect the rights of Syncfusion or others.
</p>
<h4>Updating your personal information and privacy preferences</h4>
<p>
You have the right to access and correct your personal information and privacy
preferences at any time.
</p><ul>
<li>Update information you have submitted to us. Simply login (
<a href="http://www.syncfusion.com/support/">http://www.syncfusion.com/support/</a> 
  )into our support system and select
the 'Edit My Account' option.</li>
<li>Add or remove yourself from our list using our e-mail updates(

<h4>Changes in Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>
All "personal information" that we collect and maintain will be subject to the
version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such collection. Syncfusion
reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole
discretion, and will provide notice of material changes on the home page of the
Site. If as the result of such changes, you want to alter the ways in which
Syncfusion is allowed to use your personal information, you can do so by
following the procedure described above in the section titled "Updating your
personal information and privacy preferences." You will be deemed to have been
made aware of, and will be subject to, the changes to the Privacy Policy by your
continued use of the Site after such notice has been posted for thirty (30) days
with the following exception: If at the time you provide personal information to
Syncfusion you are given the opportunity (as you currently are) to limit how
such information will be used to communicate with you, either by Syncfusion or
by third parties, Syncfusion will not change your preference in this regard
without your express consent. However, if Syncfusion sells assets (or the assets
of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or Syncfusion (or a division or
subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, Syncfusion may
provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our
business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent
</p>
<h4>Notification of Changes</h4>
<p>
If there are changes to the Privacy Statement we will also revise the "last
updated" date at the top.</p></td>
