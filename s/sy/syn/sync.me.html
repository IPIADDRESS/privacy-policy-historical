<p><br>Sync.ME understands you want to
keep certain information private, and, consequentially, we have
drafted the following privacy policy (the "<b>Privacy
Policy</b>")
to ensures that you are aware of the type of information collected by
us and, by using the Service, the uses that you permit us to make of
such information. <br>This Policy is designed to help you decide
whether to use the Service and in what manner, by outlining the
restrictions we take upon ourselves in gathering, storing and using
your information. <br>This Policy is incorporated into, subject to
and a part of the Terms of Use. If you do not agree to this Privacy
Policy, you may not and should not use the Service. The definitions
in the Terms of Use apply to this Privacy Policy.<br><br><u><b>Information
Gathered from Users</b></u><br>Sync.ME
gathers information mainly to provide, maintain and improve the
Service. Because the purpose of Service is to synchronize between
your Contacts and such Contacts Profiles and to synchronize your
Profile (or Sync.ME Card, if applicable) and your Contact’s
Profiles with other end users’ Contacts list we must gain access to
certain information regarding you and regarding your Contacts.</p>
<p><br>With
respect to you and your Contacts, Sync.ME may access and store a
name, phone number and Sync.Me may also access your Profile,
including your Profile name, Profile picture (or link thereto, if
retrieving and storing the images are prohibited by law or by the
terms of service of the applicable Approved Platform), e-mail,
birthday, status, notes and information your friends on such Approved
Platform have made available to you.</p>
<p><br><u><b>Logs</b></u><br>As
most sites do, Sync.ME systems may automatically record and store
technical information regarding the method and nature of your use of
the Service including your requests, actions, referred and exit
pages, pages visited, use time, IP, platform type, operating system
information, number of clicks, browser information, social network
user ID number and relevant cookies. <br><br><u><b>Cookies
Information</b></u><br>Sync.ME's
systems may automatically send cookies to your system. Sync.ME may
store information which correlates with those cookies, and designed
to improve and optimize the Service. <br>You may block and remove
Sync.ME's cookies through your browser and operating system, but this
may impair and hinder the Service functionality and availability.</p>
<p>Sync.ME
may use logs and cookie information to improve quality and design of
the Service, including without limitation, saving you the trouble of
re-entering data, and quarries, personalize and customize the
Service, track your use of the Service and generate statistics
regarding the Service.<br><br><u><b>No
Obligation to Store Information</b></u><br>Nothing
in this Policy is interpreted as an obligation to store information,
and Sync.ME may, at its own discretion, delete or avoid from
recording and storing any and all information. <br>You shall have no
claim against Sync.ME for deleting information, avoiding from
retrieving and storing or not complying with any information request,
including court orders and warrant by authorized entities, because
the requested information was deleted or not stored by Sync.ME and is
unavailable to it. <br><br><u><b>How
Does Sync.ME Use Information</b></u><br>Sync.ME
may use the information it gathers to provide, maintain, operate and
improve the Service. Sync.ME may also use the information it gathers
to synchronize other Sync.ME users' contact lists.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Sync.ME
may transfer information it collects in accordance with the Terms of
Service and this Privacy Policy to third parties subject to such
terms and conditions deemed appropriate by Sync.Me. You may elect to
opt-out and have your personal information removed by sending an
e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@sync.me">support@sync.me</a>
stating your full name, telephone number and a links to each of your
applicable Profiles, and a clear and unequivocal request to have your
information removed from the Service.<br><br>
</p>
<p><u><b>Non-Restricted
Information Disclosure</b></u><br>Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary stated herein, Sync.ME may:<br>- Disclose
non identifiable information (information which does not and cannot
be attributed to a specific user) to third parties who have an
interest in the Service, its functionality and its usage patterns; <br>-
Disclose information to third parties as part of a specific program
to which you will have the ability to opt-in;<br>- Disclose any
information if Sync.ME is required to do so by law or to aid a law
enforcement agency in the prevention of a crime;<br>- Disclose any
information in good faith and to the minimum extent required in legal
proceedings to which Sync.ME is a party, including without
limitation, proceedings initiated by Sync.ME;<br>- Disclose any
information in good faith and to the minimum extent required to third
parties who are requested by Sync.ME to investigate allegations made
against Sync.ME, to protect the data security, integrity and/or
operability of the Service or to protect Sync.ME rights. <br><br><u><b>Removal
and Correcting Information</b></u><br>If
you have any privacy concerns or issues, or if you would like Sync.ME
to delete or change information regarding your personal profile,
Sync.ME's data storage and other users' smartphones, please contact
us via e-mail at: <b>support@sync.me</b><br><br><u><b>Information
Warranty Disclaimer</b></u><br>Notwithstanding
anything else in this Policy, Sync.ME is not responsible for the
accuracy, correctness and security of any of the information it
gathers, stores and disclose to you or to anyone else. <br><br><u><b>Contact
via your Profile</b></u><br>Sync.ME
may offer a contact service, allowing third parties to connect with
you through the Service (the Contact Service). The Contact Service
will allow a user of the App to place a phone call to your
smartphone. <br>The Contact Service is an OPT-IN SERVICE, and you
will be asked if you want other parties (including those who do not
know your phone number) to be able to contact you through the Contact
Service. i.e., the default option is NOT to contact you directly,
unless you explicitly indicate otherwise. <br>Your phone number will
NOT be disclosed to any Contact Service user and the phone line will
be connected through a secure proxy operated by Sync.ME or on its
behalf.<br>If you believe a third party is abusing this feature,
please file an abuse report as directed in the Terms of Use.<br><br><u><b>Third
Party Advertisements</b></u><br>Sync.ME
may use advertisements to fund the Service, which may be placed,
served, managed, operated and distributed by third parties
(specialized ad industry companies) within the Service.<br>Aside from
non-identifiable information supplied to them, these third party
companies use designated technologies (including cookies) which are
not under the control or knowledge of Sync.ME, in order to measure,
improve and personalize their ad activity and effectiveness. <br><br><u><b>Data
Security</b></u><br>Sync.ME
places great emphasis on the security and integrity of your
information and the data stored in Sync.ME's systems. <br>The Service
is provided under the best commercially reasonable data security
practices, in order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
alteration or deletion of any and all information stored in Sync.ME's
systems.<br>You acknowledge, however, that no such effort can
completely guarantee the security of the stored data, that breaches
of security are still a possibility both regarding Sync.ME's systems
and that a data security breach resulting in unauthorized access to
your information can occur in third party system (for example, ISP's
and hosting services providers). <br>As a result, Sync.ME does NOT
warrant or ensure the integrity and security of the data stored in
its systems, including without limitation your information. <br>Sync.ME
shall make reasonable efforts to notify any user whose information is
suspected of being accessed, disclosed, altered or deleted by an
unauthorized person, so that he can take appropriate measure to
minimize the adverse effect of such a data security breach (Breach
Notification). Sync.ME will make reasonable efforts to give such
Breach Notification soon after Sync.ME learns of said breach, unless
Sync.ME deems, at its sole discretion, that such Notification might
hinder and prevent ongoing efforts to detect the source of the
breach.<br>For the avoidance of doubt, a Breach Notification does NOT
constitute an admission by Sync.ME that the breach occurred as a
result of malpractice, failure, bad faith or negligence on behalf of
Sync.ME or that the breach even occurred in Sync.ME's systems.
<br><br><u><b>Change
of Ownership</b></u><br>In
the event of a change of ownership or control of all or part of
Sync.ME, including without limitation through acquisition, merger or
sale, Sync.ME reserves the right to transfer all or part of the
personal information it stores in its systems.<br>You acknowledge
that in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership, Sync.ME
may have no control over the use and transfer of your personal
information.<br><br><u><b>Governing
Law and Jurisdiction</b></u><br>This
Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Israel, without regard to the conflict of laws
provisions thereof. Any dispute arising under or in relation to this
Policy shall be resolved in accordance with the terms and procedures
set forth in the Terms of Use [INSERT LINK].</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><u><b>Changes
to this Privacy Policy</b></u><br>This
Policy may be revised from time to time at Sync.ME's sole discretion.
The last revision will be reflected in the "Last modified by"
heading above. Please visit this page periodically for updates.
Continuing to use the Service continues your acceptance of
changes.<br><br><br><br><br>
