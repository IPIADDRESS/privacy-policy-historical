As a result we have drafted the following privacy policy (the Policy) which ensures that we will not use your information for any purpose other than providing, maintaining and improving our services, without your explicit consent. 
<br>This Policy is designed to help you decide whether to use the Service and in what manner, by outlining the restrictions we take upon ourselves in gathering, storing and using your information. 
<br>This Policy is incorporated into, subject to and a part of the Service's Terms of Use. If you do not agree to this Policy, you may not and should not use the Service. The definitions in the Service's Terms of Use apply to this Policy unless stated otherwise.
</p>


<h3>Information Provided by Users</h3>
<p>
Sync.ME may store all User Submissions (the statuses and notes you voluntarily submit into the service and any other information, as defined in the attached Terms of Use). 
<br>By using the Service you hereby grant Sync.ME a world-wide, non-revocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable license to use your User Submissions in any way at its sole discretion, including without limitation to reproduce, distribute, make derivatives of it and use it in order to promote Sync.ME's business in any way. 
</p>

<p>
Sync.ME gathers information to provide, maintain and improve the Service, and not to use it in any other way without your consent. PLEASE NOTE THE RESTRICTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN UPON OURSELVES IN USING GATHERED INFORMATION, AS DETAILED BELOW.

Sync.ME's systems may automatically send cookies to your computer. Sync.ME may store information which correlates with those cookies, and designed to improve and optimize the Service. 
<br>You may block and remove Sync.ME's cookies through your browser and operating system, but this may impair and hinder the Service functionality and availability.
</p>


<h3>No Obligation to Store Information</h3>
<p>
Nothing in this Policy is interpreted as an obligation to store information, and Sync.ME may, at its own discretion, delete or avoid from recording and storing any and all information. 
<br>You shall have no claim against Sync.ME for deleting information, avoiding from retrieving and storing or not complying with any information request, including court orders and warrant by authorized entities, because the requested information was deleted or not stored by Sync.ME and is unavailable to it. 
</p>

<br>- Your User Submissions to anyone whose smartphone's contacts list does not contain your phone number AND your name;
<br>- Your Profile information (excluding names) to anyone whose smartphone's contacts list does not contain your phone number AND your name; 
<br>- Your phone number to anyone.
</p>


<h3>Non-Restricted Information Disclosure</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein, Sync.ME may:
<br>- Disclose non identifiable information (information which does not and cannot be attributed to a specific user) to third parties who have an interest in the Service, its functionality and its usage patterns; 
<br>- Disclose information to third parties as part of a specific program to which you will have the ability to opt-in;
<br>- Disclose any information if Sync.ME is required to do so by law or to aid a law enforcement agency in the prevention of a crime;
<br>- Disclose any information in good faith and to the minimum extent required in legal proceedings to which Sync.ME is a party, including without limitation, proceedings initiated by Sync.ME;
<br>- Disclose any information in good faith and to the minimum extent required to third parties who are requested by Sync.ME to investigate allegations made against Sync.ME, to protect the data security, integrity and/or operability of the Service or to protect Sync.ME rights.

If you have any privacy concerns or issues or want Sync.ME to delete or change information regarding you in the Service, Sync.ME's data storage and other users' smartphones, please notify us via e-mail to: support@sync.me
</p>


<h3>Information Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
Notwithstanding anything else in this Policy, Sync.ME is not responsible for the accuracy, correctness and security of any of the information it gathers, stores and disclose to you or to anyone else. 
</p>


<h3>Contact via your Profile</h3>
<p>
Sync.ME may offer a contact service, allowing third parties to connect with you through the Service (the Contact Service). The Contact Service will allow a user of the SmartPhone App to place a phone call to your smartphone. 
<br>The Contact Service is an OPT-IN SERVICE, and you will be asked if you want other parties (including those who do not know your phone number) to be able to contact you through the Contact Service. 
<br>Your phone number will NOT be disclosed to any Contact Service user and the phone line will be connected through a secure proxy operated by Sync.ME or on its behalf.
<br>If you believe a third party is abusing this feature, please file an abuse report as directed in the Terms of Use.
</p>


<h3>Third Party Advertisements</h3>
<p>
Sync.ME uses advertisements to fund the Service, which are placed, served, managed, operated and distributed by third parties (specialized ad industry companies) within the Service.
<br>Aside from non-identifiable information supplied to them, these third party companies use designated technologies (including cookies) which are not under the control or knowledge of Sync.ME, in order to measure, improve and personalize their ad activity and effectiveness. 
</p>


<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>
Sync.ME places great emphasis on the security and integrity of your information and the data stored in Sync.ME's systems. 
<br>The Service is provided under the best commercially reasonable data security practices, in order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or deletion of any and all information stored in Sync.ME's systems.
<br>You acknowledge, however, that no such effort can completely guarantee the security of the stored data, that breaches of security are still a possibility both regarding Sync.ME's systems and that a data security breach resulting in unauthorized access to your information can occur in third party system (for example, ISP's and hosting services providers). 
<br>As a result, Sync.ME does NOT warrant or ensure the integrity and security of the data stored in its systems, including without limitation your information. 
<br>Sync.ME shall make reasonable efforts to notify any user whose information is suspected of being accessed, disclosed, altered or deleted by an unauthorized person, so that he can take appropriate measure to minimize the adverse effect of such a data security breach (Breach Notification). Sync.ME will make reasonable efforts to give such Breach Notification soon after Sync.ME learns of said breach, unless Sync.ME deems, at its sole discretion, that such Notification might hinder and prevent ongoing efforts to detect the source of the breach.
<br>For the avoidance of doubt, a Breach Notification does NOT constitute an admission by Sync.ME that the breach occurred as a result of malpractice, failure, bad faith or negligence on behalf of Sync.ME or that the breach even occurred in Sync.ME's systems. 
</p>


<h3>Change of Ownership</h3>
<p>
In the event of a change of ownership or control of all or part of Sync.ME, including without limitation through acquisition, merger or sale, Sync.ME reserves the right to transfer all or part of the personal information it stores in its systems.
<br>You acknowledge that in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership, Sync.ME may have no control over the use and transfer of your personal information.
</p><p>


</p><h3>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>
This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising under or in relation to this Policy shall be resolved in the competent court for the Central District, and you hereby submit irrevocably to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court. You agree that said court is the most appropriate forum to adjudicate such disputes.
</p>


<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
This Policy may be revised from time to time at Sync.ME's sole discretion. The last revision will be reflected in the "Last modified by" heading above. Please visit this page periodically for updates. Continuing to use the Service continues your acceptance of changes.
