                            need to collect and process information about your actual GPS location (including the latitude, longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and the time
                            the location information was recorded. Some of these services require your personal data for the feature to work and we may associate location data with
                            your device ID and other information we hold about you. We keep this data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing our services. If you
                            wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by
                            disabling the relevant feature. If you do not want your location information collected when you use the Services from a mobile device, please follow these
