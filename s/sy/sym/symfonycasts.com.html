            <h2 id="collect">What we collect</h2>
            <p>We collect information about you when you provide it to us, when you use our Services, and when other
            sources provide it to us, as further described below.</p>

            <h3>Information you provide to us</h3>
            We collect information about you when you input it into the Services or otherwise provide it directly to us.

            <div class="legal-indent">
                <h4>Account and Profile Information:</h4>We collect information about you when you register for an account,
                create or modify your profile, set preferences, sign-up for or make purchases through the Services.
                For example, you provide your contact information and, in some cases, billing information when you register
                for the Services. We keep track of your preferences when you select settings within the Services.

                <h4>Content you provide through our website:</h4> The Services include our website which is owned and operated by us.
                We collect other content that you submit to the website. Examples of content we collect and store include: comments you
                post on the site, videos you have watched, courses you have completed, challenges you have attempted, teams you have been a part of.

                <h4>Information you provide through our support channels:</h4> The Services also include customer support, where
                you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing with a Service, or questions you have on our content.
                Whether you designate yourself as a technical contact, open a support ticket, speak to one of our representatives
                directly or otherwise engage with our support team, you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of
                the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in
                resolving the issue.

                <h4>Payment Information:</h4> We collect certain payment and billing information when you register for certain paid
                Services. For example, we ask you to designate a billing representative, including name and contact information, upon registration.
                You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.

            </div>

            <h3>Information we collect automatically when you use the Services</h3>
            <p>We collect information about you when you use our Services, including browsing our
                website and taking certain actions within the Services.</p>

            <div class="legal-indent">
                <h4>Your use of the Services:</h4> We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with
                our Services. This information includes the features you use; courses, chapters, challenges and other links you click on;
                frequently used search terms; and how you interact with others on the Services. We also collect information about the teams
                you are invited to.

                <h4>Device and Connection Information:</h4> We collect information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other devices
                you use to access the Services. This device information includes your connection type and settings when you
                access, update, or use our Services. We also collect information through your device about your operating system,
                browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages and device identifiers. We use your IP address and/or country
                preference in order to approximate your location to provide you with a better Service experience. How much of this information
                we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services.

            </div>

            <h3>Information we receive from other sources</h3>
            <p>We receive information about you from other Service users and from third party services.</p>

            <div class="legal-indent">
                <h4>Other users of the Services:</h4> Other users of our Services may provide information about you when
                they submit content through the Services. For example, you may be invited by someone team or an enterprise or business account.

                <h4>Other services you link to your account:</h4> We receive information about you when you link a third-party
                service with our Services. For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Github
                credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Github profile settings in order to
                authenticate you. The information we receive when you link our Services with a third-party service depends on
                the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the
                privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or
                shared with our Services.
            </div>
            <h2 id="use">How we use information we collect</h2>

            <p>How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them,
                and any preferences you have communicated to us. Below are the specific purposes for which we use the
                information we collect about you.
            </p>
            <div class="legal-indent">
                <h4>To provide the Services and personalize your experience:</h4> We use information about you to provide the
                Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer
                support, and operate and maintain the Services. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a
                particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites.

                <h4>For research and development:</h4> We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster,
                secure, integrated and useful to you. We use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback
                provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration
                and improvement of the Services. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the
                feature out to all users.

                <h4>To communicate with you about the Services:</h4> We use your contact information to send transactional
                communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of
                subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support,
                and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages. We also provide
                tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us. For example, certain actions you
                take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature. These communications are part of the Services and
                in most cases you cannot opt out of them. If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the
                communication itself or in your account settings.

                <h4>To market, promote, and drive engagement with the Services:</h4> We use your contact information and
                information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific
                interest to you, including by email. These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing
                what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, newsletters, and events we
                think may be of interest to you. We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and
                contests. You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under "Opt-out of
                communications."

                <h4>Customer support:</h4> We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond
                to your requests for assistance, and to repair and improve the Services.

                <h4>For safety and security:</h4> We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and
                activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies.

                <h4>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights:</h4> Where required by law or where we
                believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information
                about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in
                connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.

                <h4>With your consent:</h4> We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a
                specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories
                to promote the Services, with your permission.

                <h4>Legal bases for processing (for EEA users):</h4> If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA),
                we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.
                The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information
                only where:
                <ul>
                    <li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support
                        and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</li>
                    <li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests),
                        such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights
                        and interests;</li>
                    <li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li>
                    <li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to
                    change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where
                    we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest
                    to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the
                    Services.

            <h2 id="share">How we share information we collect</h2>

            <p>In an effort to provide you with a delightful experience on SymfonyCasts we share information through
                the Services and with certain third parties. We share information we collect about you in the ways
                discussed below, including in connection with possible business transfers, but we are not in the business
                of selling information about you to advertisers or other third parties.

                </p><h3>Sharing with other Service users</h3>
                <p>When you use the Services, we share certain information about you with other Service users.</p>

                <div class="legal-indent">
                    <h4>For collaboration:</h4> You can post content, which may contain information about you.
                    For example, when you comment on a course, tutorial video or blog post, we display your profile picture and name
                    next to your comments so that other users understand who made the comment. Similarly, when you join a team,
                    your name, profile picture and contact information and will be displayed in a list for other team members so
                    they can find and interact with you.


                    <h4>Managed accounts and administrators:</h4> If you register or access the Services using an email address
                    with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization, or associate that email address with your existing
                    account and such organization wishes to establish a SymfonyCasts account, certain information about you including
                    your name, profile picture, contact info, content, and account use may become accessible to that organization’s
                    administrator and other SymfonyCasts service users.

                    <h4>Community Forums:</h4> Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, forums, bug trackers, and wikis like Trello Community5 and Trello Inspiration.6 You should be aware that any information you provide in these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.
                </div>

                <h3>Sharing with third parties</h3>
                <p>We share information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize,
                    support and market our Services.</p>

                <div class="legal-indent">
                    <h4>Service Providers:</h4> We work with third-party service providers to provide website
                    development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing,
                    analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.
                    If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they
                    do so under instruction from us, including abiding by policies and procedures designed to protect
                    your information.

                    <h4>Links to Third-Party Sites:</h4> The Services may include links that direct you to other websites
                    or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. Your use of and any information you submit
                    to any of those third-party sites is governed by their privacy policies, not this one.

                    <h4>With your consent:</h4> We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so.
                    For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public website. With your consent,
                    we may post your name alongside the testimonial.

                    <h4>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights:</h4> In exceptional
                    circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably
                    necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including
                    to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect
                    the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect SymfonyCasts, our customers or the public
                    from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to
                    disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.
                </div>

                <h3>Sharing with affiliated companies</h3>
                <p>Business transfers: We may share or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in
                    connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of the
                    SymfonyCasts to another company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services
                    if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.
                </p>

            <h2 id="store">How we store and secure information we collect</h2>

            <h3>Information storage and security</h3>
            <p>We use data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect,
                and we use technical measures to secure your data. While we implement safeguards designed to protect
                your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet,
                we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems
                or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. We will respond to requests about
                this within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

            <h3>How long we keep information</h3>
            <p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in
            further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information.</p>
            <div class="legal-indent">
                <h4>Account information:</h4> We retain your account information until you request to delete your account.
                We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes,
                to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our Services.
                Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information
                that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use
                of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.

                <h4>Information you share on the Services:</h4> If your account is inactive, some of your information
                and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow other users to make full use of the
                Services. For example, we continue to display comments and content you provided to courses, videos and
                blog posts.

                <h4>Managed accounts:</h4> If the Services are made available to you through an organization
                (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of
                your account.

                <h4>Marketing information:</h4> If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain
                information about your marketing preferences unless you specifically ask us to delete such information.
                We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time
                from the date such information was created.
            </div>

            <h2 id="access">How to access and control your information</h2>
            <p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information.
                Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.
                We will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

            <h3>Your Choices:</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information
                (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to
                request your information in a structured, electronic format. Below, we describe the tools and processes
                for making these requests. You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using
                settings available within the Services or your account. You may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@symfonycasts.com">privacy@symfonycasts.com</a>
                to request assistance.
            </p>

            <p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would
                reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator
                are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked us to share data
                with third parties, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your
                information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to
                complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your
                rights were infringed.
            </p>

            <div class="legal-indent">
                <h3>Access and update your information:</h3> Our Services give you the ability to access and update
                certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile
                information from your account. You can update your profile information within your profile settings.

                <h3>Deactivate subscription:</h3> You or an administrator can deactivate your access your SymfonyCasts
                subscription. If you can deactivate your own access, that setting is available to you in your account settings.
                Otherwise, please contact your administrator. If you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account
                through your administrator settings, please send us a <a href="/contact">contact message</a>.
                Please be aware that deactivating your subscription does not delete your information or team your information
                remains in our system. For more information on how to delete your information, see below.

                <h3>Delete your information:</h3> At anytime you may send us a message at:
                <a href="mailto:privacy@symfonycasts.com">privacy@symfonycasts.com</a> to request your personal data to be deleted.
                Please note, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.

                <h3>Request that we stop using your information:</h3> In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing,
                using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so.
                For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer
                an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent
                to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not
                affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. When you make such requests, we may need time
                to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is a delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to
                continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored
                 or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).

                 <h3>Opt out of communications:</h3> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the
                 unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your account settings, or by <a href="/contact">contacting us </a>
                 to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list. Even after you opt out from receiving
                 promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services.

                 <h3>Send "Do Not Track" Signals:</h3> Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send
                 a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common
                 understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.
                 You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt
                 out of receiving marketing from us as described above.

                 <h3>Data portability:</h3> Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you
                 can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to
                 another carrier). Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your
                 information. Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information
                 and your learning history.
            </div>

            <h2 id="transfer">How we transfer information we collect internationally</h2>
            <h3>International transfers of information we collect</h3>
            <p>We collect information globally and store that information in the United States. We transfer,
                process and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we, SymfonyCasts
                or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Services.
                Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps to protect it.</p>

            <h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
                <p>We use various technologies to collect information when you access or use our Services, including
                    placing a piece of code, commonly referred to as a “cookie,” or similar technology on your device.
                    Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive or in your device memory when you visit
                    a website or view a message. Among other things, cookies support the integrity of our registration process,
                    retain your preferences and account settings, and help evaluate and compile aggregated statistics about user
                    activity. We will begin collecting information about you or from activity on devices you use as soon as you use
                    our Services. By using our Services, you permit us to collect and use your information from activity on devices
                    you use in accordance with this Privacy Notice. For more information and to learn how to block or delete cookies

                    browser or exit the application. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to use the Services and,
                    as such, will last longer.

                    <li>
                        Remember that you have visited us or used the Services before. This allows us to identify the number of

                    <li>

                        web or application session) and the location from which you access the Services, so that we can improve
                        the Services and learn which elements and functions of the Services are most popular with our users.

                <p>Our products are intended for both personal use and use by organizations. Where the Services are made available
                    to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and
                    is responsible for the end-users over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy
                    questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization's policies.
                    We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be
                    different than this policy.
                </p>

                <h3>Children</h3>
                <p>
                    SymfonyCasts is not for use by children under the age of 16 years and SymfonyCasts does not knowingly
                    collect, store, share or use the personal data of children under 16 years. If you are under the age of
                    16 years, please do not provide any personal data, even if prompted by the Sites to do so. If you are under
                    the age of 16 years and you have provided personal data, please ask your parent(s) or guardian(s) to notify
                    SymfonyCasts at: <a href="mailto:privacy@symfonycasts.com">privacy@symfonycasts.com</a> and SymfonyCasts
                    will delete all such personal data.
                </p>

                <h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page
                    and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice by adding a notice on the Services
                    homepages, login screens, or by sending you an email notification. We will also keep prior versions of this
                    Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you use
                    the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
                </p>

                <p>If you disagree with any changes to this privacy policy, you will need to stop using the Services and deactivate
                    your account(s), as outlined above.</p>
