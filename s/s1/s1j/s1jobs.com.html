However, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent so that you can flush them from your browser if you object to their presence.</p>

<p><strong>The way we use information</strong></p>

<p>We may occasionally request your postcode details in order to ensure that we only deliver information relevant to you and only where we have obtained your prior express permission to do so. We will NOT use your postcode information to generate a full postal address (where completion of full address fields are not requested), nor will we mail out literature related to our websites unless you specifically request us to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Our Privacy Practices with Third Parties</strong></p>

<p>It is our policy to only disclose information to third parties under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
 <li>As required by law</li>
 <li>When explicitly requested by a visitor</li>
 <li>When required to deliver products or services requested by a visitor</li>
</ul>

<p>We share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. Subject to the above three circumstances, we do not provide any identifiable personal information to any third party for any purpose whatsoever.

Access by our employees and agents to your personally identifiable information are only on a need to know basis on the understanding that this is confidential business information.</p>

<p>Our intention is never to use or share personally identifiable information provided to us in ways that are different than the ways described above without also providing you with an opportunity to "unsubscribe" or prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>

<p>Because we want your experience of the Site to be as informative and useful as possible, we provide a number of links to third party sites. Always be aware of where you end up. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, or otherwise collect data or solicit personal information. We assume no responsibility for the information practices of sites that you are able to access through ours, and we encourage you to review each site's privacy policy before disclosing any personally identifiable information.</p>

We encourage you to visit this area frequently so as to stay informed. If there is any material change in the type of personally identifiable information we collect we will obtain your permission before we attempt to collect the additional personal information. We will not make any changes that allow us to give personal information to a third party without obtaining permission from you first.</p>
