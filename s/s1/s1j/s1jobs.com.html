                  <p>s1now ltd are committed to protecting your right to 
                    personal privacy. That is why we have drafted this notice 
                    to explain the type of information we collect on this web 
                    site (the "Site") and how we use this information. This Policy 
                    also explains the choices that you can make about the way 
                    your information is collected and used.</p>
                  <p>By submitting personal details to us, you are deemed as agreeing 
                    to use of these details as described in this Policy. We appreciate 
                    that this Policy may seem long, however, we have created a 
                    thorough privacy statement to fully explain our information 
                    handling practices. Should you have any questions however, 
                    please feel free to direct these to <a href="mailto:privacy@s1now.com">privacy@s1now.com</a></p>
                  <p><b>The Information We Collect</b></p>
                  <p>We request very little identifying information from you and 
                    only for a narrow set of purposes. Typically, identifying 
                    information is collected:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>For registration to certain areas of the Site;</li>
                    <li>To allow us to respond to your enquiries for further information;</li>
                    <li>To distribute requested materials; and</li>
                    <li>When you are submitting CV's.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The type of personal information collected on the Site include 
                    your name, address, email address, telephone number, user 
                    name and password. However, other information will be submitted 
                    when you respond to an online job application.</p>
                  <p>Your participation is voluntary and you will not be required 
                    to provide more information than is necessary to participate 
                    in any of the Site's activities. In any instance where non-mandatory 
                    information is sought, you will be notified of this at the 
                    point of collection.</p>
                  <p>In some instances, we may ask you questions on an aggregate 
                    basis (we don't identify you personally with the information) 
                    and such questions will be identified on the site. In all 
                    other instances, you should assume that we track any information 
                    you provide on a personally identifiable basis. </p>
                  <p><b>The Way We Use Information</b></p>
                  <p>When you register with the Site, you can elect to receive 
                    information and updates on our products and services. Information 
                    will not be used for this purpose unless you request to receive 
                    communications. We use return email addresses to answer any 
                    emails that we receive, and we may use return email addresses 
                    to send you other information that you may request. Such addresses 
                    are not used for any other purpose.</p>
                  <p>We use information that you provide (individual and aggregate) 
                    to better design the Site and to improve our marketing strategy 
                    and our products. One method through which the Site collects 
                    aggregate information is the collection of IP addresses. An 
                    IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your 
                    computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the 
                    computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify 
                    your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from 
                    this site, our servers log your IP address. We do not link 
                    IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although 
                    your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to 
                    us. To the extent such information is shared with third parties, 
                    please see "Our Privacy Practices With Third Parties" below.</p>
                  <p>You will have the opportunity to forward pages or information 
                    on the Site to friends. The information you provide to facilitate 
                    this email communication is used on a one-time basis and is 
                    not collected or retained by us.</p>
                  <p>We make every practical effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant 
                    collection of data. If you believe the Site has collected 
                    excessive information, we encourage you to contact us <a href="mailto:privacy@s1now.com">privacy@s1now.com</a></p>
                  <p><b>Unsubscribe / Delete</b></p>
                  <p>You have the right to access personal data which you have 
                    submitted through the Site. We give you the following options 
                    for managing or removing your information from our database:</p>

                      from our database. We also allow you to subscribe or unsubscribe

                  <p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>
                  <p>Cookies are files or pieces of information that may be stored 
                    in your computer's hard drive when you visit a site. We use 
                    cookies to better tailor the Site and our products to your 
                    interests and needs. Cookies may also be used to help speed 
                    up your future activities or to improve your user experience 
                    by remembering the information that you have already provided 
                    to us. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from 
                    your computer that was not voluntarily provided by you (i.e., 
                    during registration or a competition). The use of cookies 
                    is an industry standard and you will find them at most sites. 
                    Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. However, 
                    you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you 
                    when cookies are being sent so that you can flush them from 
                    your browser if you object to their presence.</p>
                  <p><b>Our Privacy Practices with Third Parties</b></p>
                  <p>It is our policy to only disclose information to third parties 
                    under the following circumstances:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>As required by law</li>
                    <li>When explicitly requested by a visitor</li>
                    <li>When required to deliver products or services requested 
                      by a visitor</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information 
                    about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, 
                    and other third parties. Subject to the above three circumstances, 
                    we do not provide any identifiable personal information to 
                    any third party for any purpose whatsoever. For example, we 
                    may tell a business partner the number of men and the number 
                    of women that entered a competition, but we do not disclose 
                    anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 
                    Access by our employees and agents to your personally identifiable 
                    information are only on a need to know basis on the understanding 
                    that this is confidential business information.</p>
                  <p>Our intention is never to use or share personally identifiable 
                    information provided to us in ways that are different than 
                    the ways described above without also providing you with an 
                    opportunity to "unsubscribe" or prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
                  <p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>
                  <p>Because we want your experience of the Site to be as informative 
                    and useful as possible, we provide a number of links to third 
                    party sites. Always be aware of where you end up. These other 
                    sites may send their own cookies to users, or otherwise collect 
                    data or solicit personal information. We assume no responsibility 
                    for the information practices of sites that you are able to 
                    access through ours, and we encourage you to review each site's 
                    privacy policy before disclosing any personally identifiable 
                    information.</p>
                  <p><b>Our Commitment to Data Security</b></p>
                  <p>We take reasonable precautions to keep your personal information 
                    secure. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, 
                    and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we 
                    collect. We cannot guarantee the security of any information 
                    you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
                  <p><b>Changes in Our Policy</b></p>
                  <p>We reserve the right to change or remove this Privacy Policy 
                    at our discretion. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy 
                    we will post those changes here. We encourage you to visit 
                    this area frequently so as to stay informed. If there is any 
                    material change in the type of information we collect, we 
                    will obtain your permission before we attempt to collect the 
                    additional personal information. We will not make any changes 
                    that allow us to give personal information to a third party 
                    without obtaining permission from you first.</p>
