<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Statement explains what information we collect about you and what we do with it. Please take a few minutes to read it. </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Who are we?</strong>

<p>
Smooch.com, owned by MakeFriendsOnline Ltd (“We”), run this site for use by members (“you”). We are registered with the UK Information Commissioner as a data controller and we try our best to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. MakeFriendsOnline Ltd will hereby be referred to as Smooch.com for the purposes of this Privacy Statement.</p></li>


<li><strong>What information do we collect about you and what do we use it for?</strong>
<p>
We collect the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact information</strong>

<p>Smooch.com's registration form requires you to give us contact information (like your user name and email address). We use this contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and your account. You will be identified on the site by your user name.</p></li>

<li><strong>Profile information</strong>
<p>
During registration on the site you will be asked to provide certain information about yourself describing things such as your physical appearance, your level of education, your star sign and attitudes towards certain things, like smoking, drinking, etc.  We collect and use this information as part of the service so other users can decide if they would like to meet you.  All of this information is optional and it is up to you to decide what you want to provide us with.</p></li>

<li><strong>Sensitive information</strong>
<p>We also ask for some information about you which is more “sensitive”, such as information about your sexuality, ethnic origin and your religion.  You may also submit photographs of yourself.  All such information you submit will be visible to all other users under “Your Profile”.  Again, we ask you for this information to help other users find out about you and decide whether they want to meet you.
</p></li>
<li><strong>Cookie information</strong>
<p>While you are using this site, we may store a text file called a “cookie” on your computer, or check for the existence of a cookie that we stored on your computer during a previous visit by you to our site. The information we store does not tell us anything about you personally, but tells us about your Smooch.com account, and the use of our site generally. For more information, see below (About Cookies).</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><strong>About Cookies</strong>
<p>Cookies are text files that are stored on your computer by websites. Cookie files help to identify the computer that is accessing our server, but not the person that is viewing the site.  Cookie files are extremely small and are not likely to use up much space on your computer.</p>
<p>
We use cookies to record the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>which of our pages are being visited</li>
<li>the date and time the site is being accessed</li>
<li>the IP address from which the site is accessed</li>
<li>the type of browser and operating system you use</li>
<li>preventing barred members from accessing our site</li>
<li>to identify members for security purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this information for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>to work out which parts of our site are most popular</li>
<li>to assist you in using certain aspects of the site – e.g. the payment page</li>
<li>to personalise some of the pages you visit</li>
</ul>
<p>
We cannot read cookies that other websites have stored on your computer.  Our cookies do not tell us what you have been doing on other sites.
</p>
<p>Some of our cookies remain on your computer only during your use of the site. Others will remain on your hard drive after your session has finished and until they automatically expire or until you delete them via your browser.</p>
<p>You do not have to agree to the use of cookies.  For information on how to reject cookies, see below (Removing and Disabling Cookies).
</p></li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Cookies</strong>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to display ads on our website. These third-party advertising companies may separately place or recognise a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to Smooch.com. We cannot see the information collected or stored in third party cookies. We do not provide personal data about you to these third party advertisers.</p></li>
<li><strong>Removing and Disabling Cookies</strong>
<p>If you don’t want us to place cookies on your computer at all, you can set your browser to disable or reject cookies. This will mean that no websites will be able to place cookies on your computer.  You can do this by adjusting the preferences within your browser.  This may mean, however, that you will not be able to enjoy full use of our service.</p>
<p>If you want to remove previously-stored cookies, you can manually delete the cookies at any time. This will not prevent websites from placing further cookies on your computer.</p>

<p class="left">To find out exactly how to disable/ remove, please go to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a></p></li>

<li><strong>Transferring your data outside Europe</strong>
<p>We have members in countries around the world.  It’s likely that at some point your data will be transferred to a country outside the EU, such as, for example, if a member outside the EU wants to find out about you and looks up your details.  Generally, most countries outside the EU have lower legal standards for protection of personal data than EU countries. However, we take reasonable precautions to safeguard your data in these circumstances by having a high level of security in place during transfer across the internet.</p></li>

<li><strong>How to access your information</strong>
<p>You can access and update your personal information at any time by logging into the site, and clicking on “Edit Profile” in the menu. To change your email address, click on “Site Preferences” in the menu.</p></li>

<li><strong>Changes to this Privacy Statement</strong>
<p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Statement from time to time. Any changes to the Privacy Statement will appear on this page, which you should check from time to time. By continuing to use the site you are deemed to accept changes to this policy. 
</p></li>
