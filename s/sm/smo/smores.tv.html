                            Adscend Media LLC ("Adscend") owns and operates a number of different sites on the Web, including without limitation Smores.tv (each one or all together referred to as "Adscend Sites"). Adscend is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. The intent of this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is to detail the information Adscend might gather about individuals who visit Adscend Sites, how that information is used, and our disclosure practices. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to websites owned and operated by Adscend, and not to the sites of other companies or organizations to which we provide links. By using any Adscend Sites, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use, which are incorporated by reference herein to this Privacy Policy. <br>
                            <br>
                            This policy is prepared in compliance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation
                            (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”), as in force from time to time. Where a particular provision applies to EU-
                            based users only, we have made this clear. For the purposes of the GDPR, our representative within

                            <br>
                            Typically, we will seek consent for the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously identified). The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances. You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, please contact us as set out below. We will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent. <br>
                            <br>
                            We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes for which the information is being provided. <br>
                            <br>

                            <b>Third Party Advertisements</b><br>
                            Adscend Sites may contain links to various other sites that are not owned by the Adscend. While Adscend makes every effort to ensure that its advertisers post clear and complete privacy policies and observe appropriate data practices, each of these sites has a privacy policy that may differ from that of Adscend. The privacy practices of other websites and companies are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that Adscend is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. Adscend encourages you to be aware when you leave the Adscend Sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collect personally identifiable information. Adscend may allow other companies, called third party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on the Adscend Sites or in Adscend emails to you. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows them to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Adscend does not have access to or control over the cookies that may be placed by these parties on your computer, and has no control over these parties' privacy policies or information collection practices. Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, Adscend does not to provide your Personal Information to its advertisers unless you make the choice to share it with them. Adscend occasionally passes Personally Identifiable Information via a secure interface to certain of its advertisers for the purpose of making it easier for you to sign up for their offers. However, this information is only to be used by the advertiser if you agree to submit the information to the advertiser for the purposes of completing an offer. In the event that Adscend is unable to capture your transaction detail, Adscend may need to validate your transaction with an advertiser or merchant partner to ensure that your account is credited. The validation information shared is used solely for this purpose and may include your first name, last name, email address, mailing address or date of birth. Adscend will require that these third parties comply with the information practices set forth in this Privacy Policy and that the information not be shared or used for any other purpose. Adscend may share non-personally identifiable information collected via the service in aggregate, anonymous form with advertisers or other third parties so that they may better evaluate what products and services are most appealing to different segments of Adscend's user base. Adscend does not disclose your first name, last name, address, email address, or any other Personal Information to these third parties unless you give your express consent. <br>

                            Adscend may set and access cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small data file that a Web site may send to your browser and which may then be stored on your system. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For the session cookie, once you close the browser, the cookie terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. We use cookie and web beacon technology to track which pages on the Adscend Sites our visitors view and which Web browsers our visitors use. We may also use cookies to help us provide personalized features and preferences to you within the various Adscend Sites in a way that may be linked to individual user information that you elect to share with us. We also use "action tags" to assist in delivering the cookie. These action tags allow us to compile statistics and other data about our customers on an aggregate basis, by embedding a random identifying number on each user's browser. We then track where that number shows up on our site. Cookies help us track your responses to our market research surveys, to record statistics behind special offers,etc., however, we will never share such personally identifiable information with third parties except as set forth below under "Sharing." Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Adscend Sites unavailable to you, though we will make every effort to ensure that users who have disabled cookies are denied access only to those portions of the website that legitimately require cookies for their functionality. Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we or a data provider we have engaged may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information.

                            In response to concerns about protecting childrens privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with Adscend policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT: 1.

Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties; We request that children under the age of 13 not submit any Personal Information to us via the Adscend Sites. It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from our servers. Questions regarding children's privacy should be directed to:<br>

                                <li>we no longer need the information for the purpose of processing, but you need it to establish
