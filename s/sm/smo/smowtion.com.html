					<h3>SMOWTION</h3>

					<p>Smowtion is an advertising network which has the objective of relating with “advertisers”, which are the national or foreign companies interested in advertising their products or services through internet (the “Advertisers”), by themselves or through or another advertising network, and with the “publishers”, which are the owners of web sites interested in issuing or publishing the advertisement of the Advertisers (the “Publishers”), rendering Smowtion a service of intermediation between Advertisers and Publishers. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, those Advertisers and Publishers which use the Services shall be considered as “Advertiser Clients” and “Publisher Clients” respectively, and together as “Clients”.</p>

					<p>As a consequence, through the Services, the Advertiser Clients, by themselves or by another advertising network, could request to advertise their products or services in web sites from the Publisher Clients, making an offer for such advertising. Once made the offer by the Advertiser Client, the one with the best offer shall have the possibility to publish its advertisements by the Publisher Clients who have chosen them.</p>

					<p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the advertisements published by the Advertiser Clients in the web sites from the Publisher Clients, shall be designated as “Advertisements”.</p>

					<p>Smowtion provides data analysis and audience segmentation services based on information provided by the Clients regarding the interactions from their users (the “Users”), including those on the Client’s web site or online advertisements.</p>

					<p>Smowtion creates usage/behavior/interest-based categories called “segments”. These segments are unique groups of Users that are created using “client side” technology, that enables the Client to selectively serve targeted advertisements based on these segments. </p>

					<p>Smowtion also provides targeting advertising services using non-personal information that is gathered across multiple, unaffiliated web sites that use our network. Much like our data analytic services provided for specific web sites, Smowtion creates network segments that are used to serve targeted advertisements in Smowtion’s network. </p>

					<h3>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM USERS. PURPOSES</h3>

					<p>Generally the Clients collect information about the Users interactions using cookies, tags, and other methods (such as the information provided by the Users while registering in the web sites from Clients). </p>

					<p>A cookie is a small text file that could identify a certain internet browser, and that is usually installed, sent or written in the computer of the internet users, when the user navigates for such web sites. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from where the cookie was transferred, the date of creation, and an identification code. The only personal information that a cookie could contain is the information that the user provides by internet navigation, such as internet protocol addresses, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time, etc. (“Activity Information”). A cookie cannot read information from the User’s hard disk nor read the cookie files created by other web sites.</p>
					
					<p>A tag is a small graphic image on a web page that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site by collecting the IP address of the computer that the tag is sent to, the URL of the page the tag comes from, and the time it was viewed. Tags also may be associated with cookie information.</p>

					<p>Clients use to collect information from Users to improve the quality of their services, due their storage of the preferences from the Users, and that they supervise the interactions tendencies, such as, the type of researches they made. </p>

					<p>Our Web site includes Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g. displaying the news, opinions, music, etc). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.</p>

					<h3>USE OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM USERS.</h3>
					
					<p>The Clients may provide information that they collect, including personally identifiable information, to Smowtion, with the previous consent, express or tacit, from Users.</p>

					<p>Also, as part of the Services, Smowtion may collect data from Users on behalf of a Client using cookies (when User visits the Client's web site or view an advertisement placed by Smowtion) and/ or tags. Information that Smowtion collects and compiles might include navigation behavior, IP addresses, logs, and other types of data. That situation shall be informed by the Clients to their Users, as well as the Users consent shall be obtained, whether express or tacit. However, Smowtion shall not collect any personally identifiable information directly from any User, whether using cookies or tags. </p>

					<p>Smowtion shall use data provided by the Client, as well as data that Smowtion collects on behalf of the Client, only to create segments and reports for the Client. Additionally, data provided by a Client, as well as data that Smowtion collects on behalf of such Client, shall be made available by Smowtion to that Client, and to those third parties with whom Smowtion may hire to provide the Services, such as QuantCast, RightMedia, y OpenX. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Smowtion shall control the access to such information by those third parties. Smowtion shall not be obliged to withhold the information for no certain term, and shall dispose the elimination of the same when considered as convenient.</p>

					<p>Smowtion may provide analytic or segmentation Services to Clients that are network advertisers or service providers, which may use the Services whereby collected data is used to predict User characteristics, behavior, or preferences typically for use in the serve of advertisings. Such Clients are responsible for notifying users of these collection practices and making opt-out procedures available (if any).</p>

					<p>A Client may correlate or merge information provided by Smowtion due to the Services, with personal information already collected or accessible by that Client. Also, on behalf of a Client, Smowtion may correlate or merge personal information provided by the Client with non-personal information that Smowtion collects for that Client. The Clients are responsible for notifying Users whether they correlate or merge personal information to non-personal information that they collect or that Smowtion or any other third party collects on their behalf.</p>

					<p>Smowtion shall develop processing of information and personal and non-personal data, according to the Privacy Policy and the additional notices included for certain Services. Also, Smowtion firmly recommends, supports and encourages the Clients, to adopt privacy policies that fully inform the Users about the used information collection practices and use of the Smowtion Services. The User should familiarize itself with the privacy practices of any web site the User visits to understand what information the site collects, how the information is used, what choices the User has, how to access the information, and how it is safeguarded.</p>
