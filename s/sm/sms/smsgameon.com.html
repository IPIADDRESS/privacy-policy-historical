Provider currently offers users access to a collection of on-line and  mobile entertainment, including SMS services. This privacy policy (the  “Privacy Policy”) was created to let you know what information we  collect, use and disclose in connection with the Site and the Services.

				  <p>2. How the personal information is used;</p>
                  <br>
				  <p>3. With whom the personal information may be shared; and</p>

				  <p>1. What information do we collect?</p>
                  <br>
				  <p>Personal information is any information that identifies you, or by  which your identity could be deduced. It does not include your name,  business address, business title, professional designations or business  telephone number. We collect several different types of personal  information from you in order to offer you the Site and Services,  including, but not limited to, the following:</p>

				  <p>A. Information collected from you at registration</p>
                  <br>
				  <p>We collect personal information when you register with us and when  you use our Site and Services. We may combine this information about you  with information we obtain from our business partners (including your  mobile communications carrier) or other companies. During registration  for some of our Services, we may require users to give us basic contact  information (such as your first and last name, e-mail addresses, and  mobile phone number), and demographic information (such as your city or  province or residence, postal code and age). The information requested  on the registration form may change from time to time.

This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for  administrative purposes.</p>
                  <br>
				  <p>We also may use cookies, a small data file stored on your computer,  to customize portions of our Services and Site to your preferences.
