Thank you for your interest in our SMS subscription service of MyPengo Mobile (referred to herein as �Provider�, �we� or �us�) and our website (the �Site�).  As you know, Provider currently offers users access to a collection of on-line and mobile entertainment, including SMS or Short Messaging Services.  These will be referred to hereinafter as the Services.  This privacy policy was created to let you know what information we collect from you and what we do with it.  By using the Site and the Services, you consent to the following terms. <br><br>

During registration for some of our services, we may require users to give us basic contact information (such as your first and last name, e-mail addresses, and mobile phone number), and demographic information (such as zip code and age). The information requested on the registration form may change from time to time.

We collect system information such as IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting, security, and to examine overall traffic trends. This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for administrative purposes. <br><br>
