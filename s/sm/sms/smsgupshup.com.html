							<p><strong>SHARING WITH PARTNERS</strong></p>
							<p>When we share personal information with certain third-party partners, including marketing and advertising partners, that information includes your name, email address and other information enabling partners to: (a) assist you in using our products and services, (b) contact you with offers, services or products that may be of interest to you, and (c) provide you with their products or services.</p>
							<p>If you are located in a jurisdiction where such sharing requires your consent, we will only do so with your consent. Please note that if you access our services through any tool that hides your location, such as through a virtual private network, you may not receive our request for permission because we were not able to identify you as being located in a jurisdiction where your permission is required.</p>
							<p>Further, our partners are prohibited from using your contact information for any purpose beyond those set forth above without your consent. We will not provide our partners with your credit card information.

							<p><strong>SHARING WITH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VENDORS</strong></p>
							<p>Occasionally, we enter into contracts with carefully selected third parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for example, providing you with customer service, fraud detection and deterrence or access to advertising assets and providing us with information technology and storage services) or to assist us in our own marketing and advertising activities (including providing us with analytic information and search engine optimization services). Our contracts with such third parties prohibit them from using any of your personal information for any purpose beyond the purpose for which it was shared.</p>
							<p>If you purchase a product or service from a third party through one of our product or brands, we will pass your personal information to such third party in order for them to fulfill your order and provide you the relevant services.</p>
							<p>We also share non-personal information with certain third parties, including the media, industry observers, marketing and advertising partners, vendors, customers, potential customers or partners. For example, we disclose mobile search trends, email open rates by industry, campaign best practices or the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, our websites or evaluated or purchased our products and services.

							<p><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests:</strong></p>
							<p>We may disclose your Information (including your Personal Information) to a third party if (a) we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (b) to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) to protect the security or integrity of Gupshup’s products and services, (d) to protect Gupshup’s , our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) to respond to an emergency which we believe in the good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information. GupShup also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that GupShup believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of GupShup, our Users or other natural person.</p>
