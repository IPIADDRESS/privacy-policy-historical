						<h1>Branding Guidelines</h1>
						<div class="terms_content">
							<p>Although we'd like to accommodate all the requests we receive from users who want to add a touch of Webaroo to their sites, we are passionate about protecting the reputation of our brand as an objective and fair provider of search results. That means we have to turn down many requests because sites imply that Webaroo is endorsing them or is otherwise affiliated with them. The same applies if Webaroo's trademarks, logos, web pages, screen shots, or other distinctive features ("Webaroo Brand Features" or "Brand Features") are associated with objectionable material, as determined by Webaroo.</p>
							<p>As a result, we require that you have Webaroo's explicit written permission before using any Webaroo Brand Features. These Brand Features can be used only pursuant to these Guidelines, our <a href="#terms_and_conditions" onclick="showDiv('1');">Terms and Conditions</a>, and for the specific purposes for which Webaroo has given permission. If you have a written agreement with Webaroo that specifically addresses how you may use its Brand Features, you don't need to go through the approval process here unless you want to do something other than what has been authorized in your existing agreement. Otherwise, the only time you can use Brand Features without advance written permission is if there is clear and express language on our website stating that you can use those Brand Features without first obtaining permission, such as is the case with our search boxes.</p>
							<p>When you use any of our Brand Features, you must always follow the Rules for Proper Usage included in these Guidelines. In addition, Webaroo may provide you with written requirements as to the size, typeface, colors, and other graphic characteristics of the Webaroo Brand Features. If we provide these requirements to you at the time of our approval, you must implement them before using our Brand Features. If we provide these requirements to you after we initially gave our permission, you must implement them within a commercially reasonable timeframe.</p>
						</div>
						<h2>Approval Process</h2>
						<div class="terms_content">
							<p>To request approval, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@smsgupshup.com">support@smsgupshup.com</a> describing your requirements in detail. Although we will try to respond within 10 business days, we cannot guarantee that, and you can't use Webaroo Brand Features until we have expressly granted you approval.</p>
							<p>The approval to use Webaroo Brand Features is limited to the information provided in your request. If your anticipated use changes, before or after, Webaroo grants approval, you must update your request accordingly.</p>
							<p>Please note that we can only give you permission to use the Webaroo Brand Features. We cannot give you permission to use any brand features belonging to third parties.</p>
						</div>
						<h2>Trademark Basics</h2>
						<span class="counter">What is a trademark?</span>
						<p>A trademark is a word, name, symbol or device (or a combination thereof) that identifies the goods or services of a person or company and distinguishes them from the goods and services of others. A trademark assures consumers of consistent quality with respect to those goods or services and aids in their promotion.</p>
						<span class="counter">Why is it important to use marks correctly?</span>
						<p>Rights to a trademark can last indefinitely if the owner continues to use the mark to identify its goods and services. If trademarks are not used properly, they may be lost and one of the company's most important assets may lose all of its value. Rights may be lost not only because of a trademark owner's improper use of the mark, but through improper use of the trademark by the public.</p>
						
						<h2>Rules for Proper Usage</h2>
						<span class="counter">Things to do:</span>
						<div class="terms_content">
							<ul>
								<li>If you are using a Webaroo trademark, distinguish the trademark from the surrounding text in some way. Capitalize the first letter, capitalize or italicize the entire mark, place the mark in quotes, use a different type style or font for the mark than for the generic name.</li>
							    <li>If you do not capitalize the entire mark, always spell and capitalize the trademark exactly as they are shown in the Webaroo Trademarks and Suggested Accepted Generic Terms below.</li>
							    <li>Use the trademark only as an adjective, never as a noun or verb, and never in the plural or possessive form.</li>
							    <li>Use a generic term following the trademark, for example: WEBAROO SMS Message, WEBAROO web search, WEBAROO SMS Group.</li>
							    <li>Use only Webaroo-approved artwork when using Webaroo's logos.</li>
							    <li>If you are using a Webaroo logo on a web page, there must exist a minimum spacing of 25 pixels between each side of the logo and other graphic or textual elements on your web page.</li>
							    <li>Normally, an unregistered Webaroo Brand Feature should be followed by the superscripted letters TM or SM to give notice that the company claims trademark rights in the term. A registered Webaroo Brand Feature should be followed by the symbol ® to identify the term as a registered trademark. In advertising copy, notice of trademark rights may be provided in a footnote format e.g., by placing an asterisk adjacent to the Webaroo Brand Feature and placing an appropriate notice at the bottom of the page on which the asterisk appears. Example: *WEBAROO is a trademark of Webaroo Technology (India) Private Limited.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						
						<span class="counter">Things You Can't Do</span>
						<div class="terms_content">
							<ul>
								<li>One of the conditions for all uses is that you can't mess around with our marks. Only we get to do that. Don't remove, distort or alter any element of a Webaroo Brand Feature. That includes modifying a Webaroo trademark, for example, through hyphenation, combination or abbreviation, such as: webariscious, webarookangaroo, Webaroomania. Do not shorten, abbreviate, or create acronyms out of Webaroo trademarks.</li>
							    <li>Don't display a Webaroo Brand Feature as the most prominent element on your web page.</li>
							    <li>Don't display a Webaroo Brand Feature in any manner that implies a relationship or affiliation with, sponsorship, or endorsement by Webaroo, or that can be reasonably interpreted to suggest editorial content has been authored by, or represents the views or opinions of Webaroo or Webaroo personnel.</li>
							    <li>Don't display a Webaroo Brand Feature on any web site that contains or displays adult content, promotes gambling, involves the sale of tobacco or alcohol to persons under twenty-one years of age, or otherwise violates applicable law.</li>
							    <li>Don't display a Webaroo Brand Feature in a manner that is in Webaroo's sole opinion misleading, unfair, defamatory, infringing, libelous, disparaging, obscene or otherwise objectionable to Webaroo.</li>
							    <li>Don't display a Webaroo Brand Feature on a site that violates any law or regulation.</li>
							    <li>Don't frame or mirror any Webaroo page (including any page that appears in response to click on any logo or search box).</li>
							    <li>Don't incorporate Webaroo Brand Features into your own product name, service names, trademarks, logos, or company names.</li>
							    <li>Don't copy or imitate Webaroo's trade dress, including the look and feel of Webaroo web design properties or Webaroo brand packaging, distinctive color combinations, typography, graphic designs, product icons, or imagery associated with Webaroo.</li>
							    <li>Don't adopt marks, logos, slogans, or designs that are confusingly similar to our Brand Features.</li>
							    <li>Don't register Webaroo trademarks as second-level domain names.</li>
							    <li>Don't use Webaroo trademarks in a way that suggests a common, descriptive, or generic meaning.</li>
							    <li>Trademark rights vary from country to country. Some countries have severe criminal and civil penalties for improper use of the registration symbol. Therefore, don't use the registration symbol (®) in countries where the mark has not been registered.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>If there is any question about usage, requests for clarification or permission may be submitted by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@smsgupshup.com">support@smsgupshup.com</a> or by writing to us at Brand Features Agent, Webaroo Technology (India) Private Limited, 3rd Floor, Unit No CM-1, SINE/CSRE Building, IIT Bombay, Powai, Mumbai 400076, India.</p>
