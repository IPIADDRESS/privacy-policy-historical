                        <p>SMSPUP only collects personally identifiable information that is volunteered by Members during the registration process or in response to specific
                        information requests presented directly to Members. SMSPUP only collects information that is necessary for us to perform our business and provide the Service to you.</p>
                        <p>Specific identifiable information is collected from Members for the purpose of determining the eligibility for, and providing of SMSPUP rewards and prizes. This information
                        includes details such as name, address, email address and phone number.</p>
                        <p>By submitting a completed questionnaire for the additional offers and discounts you also agree to supply your contact information and questionnaire responses to the
                        companies and organisations you have explicitly expressed an interest to receive further information from. These third party companies and organisations may use your
                        contact details to contact you by mail, phone or email to send offers and promote their services based on your selected preferences. By responding to a question you expressly
                        consent for that named third party company or organisation to contact you using the details you provided.</p>
                        <p>Personal information may also be used to create an anonymous link to additional third party data and that this data will be placed in cookies for the purpose of online
                        anonymous advertising that is unaffiliated with the SMSPUP site.  </p>
                        <p>We may also share your personal information and/or social-demographic information, including, without limitation, a unique identification number ("UID"),
                        postal code, gender, marital status, education, ethnicity/race (where permitted by applicable law), employment related information, and non-personally 
                        identifiable information on household members, with third party sample/market research companies (individually each a "Third Party MR Company" and 
                        collectively the "Third Party MR Companies") for the purpose of identifying survey opportunities that you may be eligible for through the Third Party MR
                        Companies. If you are eligible for a survey opportunity, the Third Party MR Company will provide your unique identification number and a survey link to us
                        and we will invite you to participate in the survey. We will not share your name, email address, or phone number with the Third Party MR Companies. In
                        connection with the sharing of your information with a Third Party MR Company, your information may be transferred and stored outside of Australia.
                        If you have any questions about this data sharing please contact the SMSPUP Privacy Office using the details below or alternatively you can <a href="/unsubscribe.php">unsubscribe
                        from the SMSPUP website here</a>. Your participation in such survey opportunities does not entitle you to any benefits offered by, or membership with,
                        the Third Party MR Companies. </p>
                        <p>We may use third parties to supply and deliver rewards and prizes. In this case it is necessary to share your personal information for fulfilment purposes. These third
                        parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purposes. Where this occurs, SMSPUP takes reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information

                        <p>We may host competitions and information request forms on behalf of our clients. These forms will clearly identify the identity and contact details of the organisation
                        collecting the personal information, and the information you provide will be managed according to the privacy policy of that third party. In the event

                           <li>Member Profile - SMSPUP collects and stores general information about our Members and their activity on our site and affiliated sites so that we can
                           improve our offerings and tailor content on our site and affiliated sites to meet the interests of our Members. The information we collect includes the non-personally
                           identifiable information volunteered during the registration process or in response to specific information requests presented directly to Members. Wherever possible,
													 we will use the information we hold to improve the relevance of surveys and if applicable, email promotions that we send to Members.<br>
                           SMSPUP may make general aggregate data
                           (such as age groups, interest profiles, geographic regions and other non-identifying information) about our Members available to existing and potential advertisers,
                           business partners and investors. This aggregate data never contains specific identifiable information about any individual user.</li><br>
                           <li>IP Address - The SMSPUP servers automatically record your IP address, your browser type and operating system when you access our site. We may use this information to help
                           diagnose problems with our server, administer our web site and compile aggregate user information for our advertisers. If we detect fraud or abuse of our system we may use
                           the IP address of the offender to take action against them.</li><br>
                           <li>Cookies - SMSPUP uses Cookies to personalise your experience and identify you when you are logged in to our site. We may also use cookies so you can participate in surveys
                           regarding specific ads and promotions you view while browsing the web. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, certain third party research firms may write, set,
                           or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies, and/or any other related technology (each a Third Party Technology and collectively the Third Party Technologies).
                           If you participate, you may be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and the market research firm will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen,
                           clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, the market research firm or their partners will
                           provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey. If you do not wish to participate in this program, you are able to
                           <a href="/unsubscribe.php">unsubscribe from the SMSPUP website here</a> and Third Party Technologies will not be set in your browser.<br>
                           If you do not want us to use cookies then you can easily stop them, or be notified when they are being used, by configuring your browser. If you do not allow cookies to be used
                           some of our website might not work for you. </li><br>
                           <li>Clear GIFs - SMSPUP may use technology known as "Clear GIFs" on our Site, in our email communications and on the web sites of our affiliates or partners. Clear GIFs do
													 not store or contain any personally identifiable information but they allow us to better track the effectiveness of our promotions.<br>
                           SMSPUP has developed a system to automatically
                           credit our Members with reward points when they transact with our partners or affiliates, e.g. at the completion of a survey. This system uses a combination of a Cookie and a Clear
                           GIF to enable us to identify the transaction as belonging to you and to credit your account accordingly. By disabling support for Cookies in your browser we will be unable to recognise
                           the transaction or credit your account. This system does not allow any third party to access any of your personally identifiable information.</li><br>

                        also be contacted by third parties. By responding to a specific question you expressly consent for that named third party company or organisation to contact you using the details you provide.</p>

                        <p>Unless you are a Premium Member, we will not send you more than one email promotion and one survey invitation per day. In general you will receive email from us less frequently
                        than this.</p>
