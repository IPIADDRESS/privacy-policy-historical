<b><a name="general"></a>General Privacy Statement</b><br>
The Science Museum of Minnesota is committed to its mission of 
"inviting learners of all ages to experience their changing world 
through science." As an element of its operations in pursuit of 
that mission, the Science Museum routinely collects contact and 
other personal information from or about its constituents. The 
Science Museum recognizes and respects the need for privacy and 
security with information of this kind. The Science Museum is 
committed to following both the letter and the spirit of all laws 
governing its operations, including those pertaining to privacy 
and use of information.<br>
<br>
The following privacy 
policy describes the Science Museum's current policies and practices 
with regard to information collected from and about its constituents. 
Unless otherwise indicated, all procedures apply to information 
collected online (via the Internet, World Wide Web, and e-mail) 
and offline (via postal mail, telephone, fax, and in person). 
The collective term "constituents" is used to refer to Science 
Museum members, donors, Web site visitors, students, retail and 
rental customers, gift recipients for whom personal information 
is required, people who respond to offers sent by mail, people 
who request that information about the museum be sent to them, 
and all others from whom we collect information in order to provide 
requested services and products.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="notification"></a>Notification of Changes to this Policy</b><br>
To further its mission and better serve its constituents, the 
Science Museum is continually improving and adding new functionality 
and features to its Web site and improving and adding to its existing 
services and programs. Because of these ongoing changes and the 
changing nature of technology, the Science Museum's information 
practices will change from time to time.<br>
<br>
If and when its information 
practices change, the Science Museum will post the policy changes 
to its Web site to notify its constituents of the changes and, 
where appropriate and practical, give them the opportunity to 
"opt-out" of the new programs and practices. If you are concerned 
about how your personal information is used, please check back 
at the Science Museum's Web site frequently or contact the Membership 
or Development Office; ACEC students should contact the ACEC directly.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="infocollected"></a>Information Collected by the Museum</b><br>
The Science Museum currently collects constituent contact information 
(such as street address, phone and fax numbers and e-mail address); 
transactional information (such as information collected in connection 
with the purchase of tickets, memberships and member programs, 
retail purchases, and class registrations); information collected 
in connection with newsletter and e-mail subscriptions; and information 
about donations made to the museum. Additional information provided 
by the constituent-such as responses to survey information and 
information collected to fulfill requests for information about 
the Science Museum-may also be added to museum databases. The 
Science Museum supplements its databases with commercially available 
marketing information about individuals whose names are already 
in its databases.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="thirdpartyinfo"></a>Information Submitted by Third Parties</b><br>
If, for example, a constituent purchases a gift certificate or 
reserves a ticket for someone else, or registers someone else 
for a class, the Science Museum collects not only the information 
the constituent provides about him or herself, but also the information 
the constituent provides about the other person. All of this information 
is subject to the practices within this policy. Gift memberships 
and class registrations are acknowledged by mail; advanced reservations 
are not. To inquire about information provided about you by someone 
else, please contact the Membership or Development Office); ACEC 
students should contact the ACEC directly.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="personalonline"></a>Personal Information Collected by the Museum Online</b><br>
The Science Museum collects the personal information constituents 
specifically provide when they visit our Web site. This includes, 
for example, the information constituents provide when they purchase 
a membership or merchandise, register for a class or complete 
a survey. In addition, our e-mail newsletters and information 
updates often contain hyperlinks to additional information on 
our Web site and elsewhere on the Web. The museum currently uses 
technology to track how often these links are used and which pages 
particular e-mail subscribers choose to view. The museum uses 
this information to compile statistics, improve these e-mail services 
and customize our future communications with e-mail subscribers.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="otheronline"></a>Other Information Collected by the Museum Online</b><br>
The Science Museum uses technology to collect a wide range of 
statistical information about the use of our Web site. For example, 
we currently use technology to determine how constituents access 
the Web site (this information may include the name of the visitor's 
Internet service provider or the type of Web browser used) and 
which pages they view. This technology does not identify constituents 
personally - it simply enables the museum to compile statistics 
about our site visitors and the use of the site.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="acec"></a>The Science Museum Adult Computer Education Center</b><br>
The Science Museum Adult Computer Education Center (ACEC) operates 
an educational facility at the Science Museum and a Web site at 
<a href="http://comped.smm.org/">http://comped.smm.org/</a>. 
Please refer to the privacy policy posted 
on the ACEC site for details about its use of information, or 
contact the ACEC directly.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b><a name="cookies"></a>Cookies</b><br>
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your 
computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems 
to recognize your browser. The Science Museum currently uses cookies 
to store constituents' preferences and record session information 
such as items that consumers add to their online shopping carts 
in the ticketing area or while registering for classes. Cookies 
are also used to record page location to assist with navigation 
and menus on our site.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="webticketing"></a>Web Ticketing Services Provided by TM Vista</b><br>
Advanced reservation services on the World Wide Web are provided 
by VISTA Ticketing/museumtix.com. When a web user chooses this 
option for ticket reservations, his or her Web browser is linked 
to the museumtix.com site. Users on the museumtix.com site are 
subject to that site's privacy policies. 
Please refer to the <a href="http://www.museumtix.com/">museumtix.com</a> 
site for detailed information.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="ssl"></a>SSL Encryption</b><br>
The Science Museum currently uses Secure Socket Layering (SSL) 
to encrypt certain types of sensitive information, such as financial 
information, while that data travels over the Internet.
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="coppa"></a>Children's Privacy on the Web </b><br>
The Science Museum encourages families to visit the museum's Web 
site together as a shared activity, and the museum abides by the 
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Currently, the 
only time the museum knowingly collects personal information through 
its Web site from children under 13 is when it receives requests 
from children to join a Science Museum educational mailing list. 
In order to register online for an educational mailing list, any 
visitor under age 13 is required to provide a valid e-mail address 
for his or her parent or legal guardian. The parent or legal guardian 
receives e-mail notification with information about the educational 
mailing list as well as instructions on how to remove the child 
from the mailing list at any time. The Science Museum does not 
knowingly transfer the names of anyone under the age of 13 from 
its educational mailing lists to its general mailing lists.<br>
<br>
In compliance with 
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we do our best to 
delete any information we inadvertently collect from children 
under the age of 13 who visit our Web site as soon as we gain 
actual knowledge of its existence. If you learn or suspect that 
your child has provided personal information to the Science Museum 
during one of his or her visits to our Web site, please contact 
the Membership or Development Office or, if your child visited 
the ACEC site, please call the ACEC directly.<br>
<br>
To learn more about 
how to protect your child's privacy on the Web, please see "A 
Parent's Guide to Online Privacy" from the Center for Media Education 
at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/</a><br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="useofinfo"></a>Use of Information</b><br>
The Science Museum currently uses the information it collects 
about its constituents to provide the products, services, and 
membership benefits our constituents request, to tailor marketing 
and fundraising contacts with specific individuals or groups of 
constituents; to administer science museum programs, to improve 
museum services and offerings; to improve the museum's Web sites 
and electronic communications; and to improve operating procedures 
to better serve constituents.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="sharinginfo"></a>Sharing of Information</b><br>
The Science Museum currently shares its mailing and telephone 
lists with other museums, sponsors and other organizations, subject 
to the safeguards described below ("Use of Postal Address Information 
and Opt-Out" and "Use of Telephone Numbers and Opt-Out"). The 
museum does not share its mailing and telephone lists with political 
candidates, parties or campaign organizations.<br>
<br>
The Science Museum 
currently shares aggregate information, such as attendance figures, 
marketing and fundraising response rates, online session data 
and group demographics, with other museums, sponsors, and other 
organizations. This information does not personally identify any 
of the museum's constituents.<br>
<br>
The Science Museum 
may share the information in our databases with outside vendors 
and organizations that provide support services to us or that 
help us with our marketing and fundraising programs.<br>
<br>
In addition, there 
may be some other, limited circumstances in which the Science 
Museum may share or transfer the information in its databases, 
for example, to respond to judicial process, to comply with state, 
federal or local laws, to protect the security or integrity of 
its databases or its Web site, to take precautions against liability, 
in the event of a corporate reorganization or, to the extent required 
by law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="useofpostal"></a>Use of Postal Address Information and Opt-Out</b><br>
The Science Museum collects and maintains in its databases the 
names and postal addresses of many constituents. Science Museum 
constituents may receive periodic mailings from the museum with 
information on new products and services, upcoming events, or 
requests for donations to the museum. If you do not wish to receive 
such mailings, please contact the Membership or Development Office; 
ACEC students should contact the ACEC directly.<br>
<br>
The Science Museum 
of Minnesota currently shares constituent postal addresses with 
other museums and organizations with which it partners for specific 
uses such as marketing, sales solicitations, and fundraising. 
The Science Museum only shares its mailing list for a specific 
purpose, and a qualified list broker or vendor administers the 
use of the list. The broker or vendor does not share Science Museum 
constituent information directly with a museum partner. Rather, 
the broker or vendor uses the lists to mail materials provided 
by the partner to the people on the mailing list. The broker or 
vendor then deletes the information provided by the Science Museum 
from its databases. Thus, our partner only has access to personal 
information provided by individuals who chose to respond to the 
mailing.<br>
<br>
If you do not want 
your name and postal address shared, please contact the Membership 
or Development Office; ACEC students should contact the ACEC directly.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="useofphone"></a>Use of Telephone Numbers and Opt-Out</b><br>
The Science Museum collects and maintains in its databases the 
names and telephone numbers of many constituents. Science Museum 
constituents may receive telephone calls from the museum with 
information on new products and services, upcoming events, or 
requests for donations to the museum. If you do not wish to receive 
such phone calls, please contact the Membership or Development 
Office; ACEC students should contact the ACEC directly.<br>
<br>
The Science Museum 
of Minnesota currently shares the names and telephone numbers 
of constituents with other museums and organizations with which 
it partners for specific uses such as marketing, sales solicitations, 
and fundraising. A qualified list broker, vendor, or contractor 
acts as an intermediary and administers the use of our telephone 
list. The broker, vendor, or contractor does not share Science 
Museum constituent information directly with our partners. Rather, 
the broker, vendor, or contractor uses the information on the 
lists to contact Science Museum constituents on behalf of our 
partner. After the broker, vendor or contractor has made contact 
with the constituent, it deletes the information provided by the 
Science Museum from its database. Therefore, our partner only 
has access to personal information from those constituents who 
respond affirmatively to a phone call made on behalf of the partner.<br>
<br>
If you do not want 
your name and telephone number shared, please contact the Membership 
or Development Office; ACEC students should contact the ACEC directly.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="optinemail"></a>E-Mail Correspondence, Newsletters, and Informational Updates</b><br>
The Science Museum of Minnesota does not share constituent e-mail 
addresses with third parties and does not send unsolicited e-mail. 
E-mail addresses provided to the museum are used for sending responses 
to questions and queries, providing purchase and registration 
confirmation, and communicating follow-up information. The museum 
also sends e-mail newsletters and informational updates to those 
who request them. Constituents who receive e-mail newsletters 
and updates may request to be removed from these lists at any 
time. Instructions on how to do so are provided within the message.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="reviewinginfo"></a>Reviewing Information</b><br>
Upon request, the Science Museum does its best to provide constituents 
with access to their own unique identifier information (e.g. member 
ID number), contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number, 
e-mail address), and a description of other information that is 
maintained about them. The Science Museum does its best to correct 
any inaccuracies that are brought to its attention. Constituents 
who wish to review this information may contact the Membership 
or Development Office; ACEC students should call the ACEC directly.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="thirdpartylists"></a>Third Party Mailing Lists</b><br>
When the Science Museum uses mailing lists provided by other organizations, 
a qualified list broker or vendor administers the list on behalf 
of the Science Museum. The broker or vendor does not share information 
directly with the Science Museum. Rather, the broker or vendor 
uses the list to mail materials provided by the museum to the 
people on the mailing list. The broker or vendor then deletes 
the list from its database. The Science Museum therefore only 
has access to personal information from those who respond to a 
mailing. When it receives a request to be removed from a mailing 
list that is administered by a third party, the museum forwards 
this request to the third party, but the museum cannot ensure 
that names will be removed from third party lists.<br>
<br>
<font size="1"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font><br>
<br>
<b><a name="compliance"></a>Compliance with this Policy</b><br>
The Science Museum of Minnesota is very sensitive to concerns 
regarding privacy of information. The museum will review its practices 
regularly to make sure that they continue to be in the best interests 
of Science Museum constituents, the museum's mission, and the 
citizens of Minnesota whom the museum serves.<br>
