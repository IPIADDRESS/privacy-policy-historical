          The Science Museum of Minnesota is committed to its mission of "inviting 
          learners of all ages to experience their changing world through science." 
          As an element of its operations in pursuit of that mission, the Science 
          Museum routinely collects contact and other personal information from 
          or about its constituents. The Science Museum recognizes and respects 
          the need for privacy and security with information of this kind. The 
          Science Museum is committed to following both the letter and the spirit 
          of all laws governing its operations, including those pertaining to 
          privacy and use of information. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following privacy policy 
          describes the Science Museum's current policies and practices with regard 
          to information collected from and about its constituents. Unless otherwise 
          indicated, all procedures apply to information collected online (via 
          the Internet, World Wide Web, and e-mail) and offline (via postal mail, 
          telephone, fax, and in person). The collective term "constituents" is 
          used to refer to Science Museum members, donors, Web site visitors, 
          students, retail and rental customers, gift recipients for whom personal 
          information is required, people who respond to offers sent by mail, 
          people who request that information about the museum be sent to them, 
          and all others from whom we collect information in order to provide 
          requested services and products.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name="notification"></a>Notification 
          of Changes to this Policy </b><br>
          To further its mission and better serve its constituents, the Science 
          Museum is continually improving and adding new functionality and features 
          to its Web site and improving and adding to its existing services and 
          programs. Because of these ongoing changes and the changing nature of 
          technology, the Science Museum's information practices will change from 
          time to time. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If and when its information 
          practices change, the Science Museum will post the policy changes to 
          its Web site to notify its constituents of the changes and, where appropriate 
          and practical, give them the opportunity to "opt out" of the new programs 
          and practices. If you are concerned about how your personal information 
          is used, please check back at the Science Museum's Web site frequently 
          or contact the Membership or Development Office; ACEC students should 
          contact the ACEC directly. </font></p>

          The Science Museum currently collects constituent contact information 
          (such as street address, phone and fax numbers and e-mail address); 
          transactional information (such as information collected in connection 
          with the purchase of tickets, memberships and member programs, retail 
          purchases, and class registrations); information collected in connection 
          with newsletter and e-mail subscriptions; and information about donations 
          made to the museum. Additional information provided by the constituent-such 
          as responses to survey information and information collected to fulfill 
          requests for information about the Science Museum-may also be added 
          to museum databases. The Science Museum supplements its databases with 
          commercially available marketing information about individuals whose 
          names are already in its databases. </font></p>

          If, for example, a constituent purchases a gift certificate or reserves 
          a ticket for someone else, or registers someone else for a class, the 
          Science Museum collects not only the information the constituent provides 
          about him or herself, but also the information the constituent provides 
          about the other person. All of this information is subject to the practices 
          within this policy. Gift memberships and class registrations are acknowledged 
          by mail; advanced reservations are not. To inquire about information 
          provided about you by someone else, please contact the Membership or 
          Development Office); ACEC students should contact the ACEC directly.

          Information Collected by the Museum Online</b><br>
          The Science Museum collects the personal information constituents specifically 
          provide when they visit our Web site. This includes, for example, the 
          information constituents provide when they purchase a membership or 
          merchandise, register for a class or complete a survey. In addition, 
          our e-mail newsletters and information updates often contain hyperlinks 
          to additional information on our Web site and elsewhere on the Web. 
          The museum currently uses technology to track how often these links 
          are used and which pages particular e-mail subscribers choose to view. 
          The museum uses this information to compile statistics, improve these 
          e-mail services and customize our future communications with e-mail 
          subscribers. </font></p>

          Information Collected by the Museum Online </b><br>
          The Science Museum uses technology to collect a wide range of statistical 
          information about the use of our Web site. For example, we currently 
          use technology to determine how constituents access the Web site (this 
          information may include the name of the visitor's Internet service provider 
          or the type of Web browser used) and which pages they view. This technology 
          does not identify constituents personally - it simply enables the museum 
          to compile statistics about our site visitors and the use of the site.

          Privacy on the Web </b><br>
          The Science Museum encourages families to visit the museum's Web site 
          together as a shared activity, and the museum abides by the Children's 
          Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Currently, the only time the 
          museum knowingly collects personal information through its Web site 
          from children under 13 is when it receives requests from children to 
          join a Science Museum educational mailing list. In order to register 
          online for an educational mailing list, any visitor under age 13 is 
          required to provide a valid e-mail address for his or her parent or 
          legal guardian. The parent or legal guardian receives e-mail notification 
          with information about the educational mailing list as well as instructions 
          on how to remove the child from the mailing list at any time. The Science 
          Museum does not knowingly transfer the names of anyone under the age 
          of 13 from its educational mailing lists to its general mailing lists. 
          </font></p>

          safeguards described below ('Use of Postal Address Information and Opt-Out"

          may receive periodic mailings from the museum with information on new

          currently shares constituent postal addresses with other museums and

          its mailing list for a specific purpose, and a qualified list broker 
          or vendor administers the use of the list. The broker or vendor does 
          not share Science Museum constituent information directly with a museum 
          partner. Rather, the broker or vendor uses the lists to mail materials 
          provided by the partner to the people on the mailing list. The broker 
          or vendor then deletes the information provided by the Science Museum 
          from its databases. Thus, our partner only has access to personal information

          and telephone numbers of many constituents. Science Museum constituents 
          may receive telephone calls from the museum with information on new 
          products and services, upcoming events, or requests for donations to 
          the museum. If you do not wish to receive such phone calls, please contact 
          the Membership or Development Office; ACEC students should contact the 
          ACEC directly. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Science Museum of Minnesota 
          currently shares the names and telephone numbers of constituents with 
          other museums and organizations with which it partners for specific 
          uses such as marketing, sales solicitations, and fundraising. A qualified 
          list broker, vendor, or contractor acts as an intermediary and administers 
          the use of our telephone list. The broker, vendor, or contractor does 
          not share Science Museum constituent information directly with our partners. 
          Rather, the broker, vendor, or contractor uses the information on the 
          lists to contact Science Museum constituents on behalf of our partner. 
          After the broker, vendor or contractor has made contact with the constituent, 
          it deletes the information provided by the Science Museum from its database. 
          Therefore, our partner only has access to personal information from 
          those constituents who respond affirmatively to a phone call made on 
          behalf of the partner. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you do not want your name 
          and telephone number shared, please contact the Membership or Development 
          Office; ACEC students should contact the ACEC directly.</font></p>

          E-Mail Newsletters and Informational Updates</b><br>
          The Science Museum of Minnesota does not share constituent e-mail addresses 
          with third parties and does not send unsolicited e-mail. E-mail addresses 
          provided to the museum are used for direct communication from the Science 
          Museum to individuals, including sending responses to questions received 
          by Science Museum staff and sending purchase or registration confirmation. 
          The museum also sends specifically requested e-mail newsletters and 
          informational updates to those who request them. Constituents who receive 
          e-mail newsletters and informational updates may request to be removed 
          from these lists at any time. Specific instructions on how to do so 
          are included with each e-mail newsletter and information update. </font></p>

          Information </b><br>
          Upon request, the Science Museum does its best to provide constituents 
          with access to their own unique identifier information (e.g. member 
          ID number), contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number, 
          e-mail address), and a description of other information that is maintained 
          about them. The Science Museum does its best to correct any inaccuracies 
          that are brought to its attention. Constituents who wish to review this 
          information may contact the Membership or Development Office; ACEC students 
          should call the ACEC directly. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name="thirdpartylists"></a>Third 
          Party Mailing Lists </b><br>
          When the Science Museum uses mailing lists provided by other organizations, 
          a qualified list broker or vendor administers the list on behalf of 
          the Science Museum. The broker or vendor does not share information 
          directly with the Science Museum. Rather, the broker or vendor uses 
          the list to mail materials provided by the museum to the people on the 
          mailing list. The broker or vendor then deletes the list from its database. 
          The Science Museum therefore only has access to personal information 
          from those who respond to a mailing. When it receives a request to be 
          removed from a mailing list that is administered by a third party, the 
          museum forwards this request to the third party, but the museum cannot 
          ensure that names will be removed from third party lists. </font></p>

          The Science Museum of Minnesota is very sensitive to concerns regarding 
          privacy of information. The museum will review its practices regularly 
          to make sure that they continue to be in the best interests of Science 
          Museum constituents, the museum's mission, and the citizens of Minnesota 
          whom the museum serves. </font></p>
