<h1>Your Smiley Interstitial Ad Network (SIAN) Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
This website, at Coreg.smileymedia.com (the "Site") is a website provided by Smiley Mediaï¿½s Smiley Interstitial Ad Network (SIAN) that matches people to advertisers that may be of interest to them by sending your answers to questions and information about you to various advertisers. Like any website for which you register and provide information about yourself or your opinions, it is wise to pay attention to your personal information.  At SIAN we understand this, and have established this Privacy Policy to explain how information is collected on the Site and how this information is used and disclosed.  By using the Site or any of the various services made available to you on the Site (the "Services"), you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>Use by Persons Under 13 Years of Age Prohibited</h2>
<p>The Site and the Services are not directed to children and are intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. All persons under 13 years of age are prohibited from registering on the Site and should not otherwise provide SIAN with any personal information.  We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 through the Site or the Services.  If you believe that a child in your care has registered on the Site or has otherwise provided us with personal information, please inform us by <a href="mailto:getitfree@getitfree.net?Subject=Ad Network Privacy Policy">contacting us</a>.  We may ask you to provide additional information to verify your identity and your authority to act on the child's behalf before taking appropriate action, if any, to remove or disable any personal information in our control.

</p>
<h2>User Information Collected by SIAN on the Site</h2>
<h3>Information Users Voluntarily Provide to Us</h3>
<p>When users access the Site, personal information may be provided to us in the form of data passed by the site referring them to us, or in the form of information that we request in one or more registration forms ("Registration Information").  Registration Information requested may include, without limitation, the user's first and last name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, gender, date of birth, and other personal information. At times, SIAN may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from other companies or sources. If so, this Privacy Policy governs such information.
</p>
<p>
During registration, users may also complete questions that provide information that is helpful us and to our advertisers in understanding the demographics and consumer behavior of our users.
</p>
<p>
After you complete the question process, SIAN may send your data to our advertisers, and our advertisers may contact you with email messages to the email address provided by the user during registration, with phone calls, with faxes, or with postal mail directed to a postal mailing address that you supplied. 
</p>
<h3>Cookies and Passive Data Collection</h3>
<p>
SIAN automatically, or "passively," may collect certain standard user information and clickstream data, which is a record of click selections within SIAN, for all users.  For example, we may log a user's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, operating system, browser type, time and date of visit and page views. We may collect this information through the use of server logs, "cookies" and "pixel tags."

</p>
<p>
Cookies are small data files sent by a website to a user's browser and hard drive that identify the user's computer to the website. We may use cookies on the Site to validate users' sessions on the Site, to administer the Site, to provide the Services and to allow enhanced features, such as recognizing users. We may also use cookies to enable customizable content and other new features for users as such content and features become available.
</p>
<p>
Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in Web pages, HTML-encoded email messages and certain other types of content, which may read cookies. 
</p>
<p>
Pages on the Site may also contain similar pixel tags that allow us to count users who have visited those pages, to compile aggregated statistics about site usage, and to deliver co-branded and other new features and services as they become available. Pixel tags on the Site may collect information such as a cookie number, time and date of a page view and a description of the page on which the pixel tag resides.  We may use information gathered from pixel tags to improve the content of our Site and email messages, to help us diagnose problems with our servers and other equipment, to administer the Site, to provide the Services and to provide new or enhanced features or tailored products or services to our users as they become available.
</p>
<p>
Advertisers and other third parties may place third-party elements, including pixel tags, JavaScript code or similar code on the Site, and may use other tools and techniques, to gather information about users of the Site.  These third party elements may be used on the Site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or to collect anonymous tracking information.  These third parties may also place cookies on the Site, which may be used to gather anonymous tracking information and the same types of information as we collect by using cookies.  These cookies may be placed on the Site in conjunction with pixel tags and pieces of code placed on the Site by that third party.  Information collected by these third parties in these manners is subject to those third parties' policies governing use and disclosure of personal information. 
</p>
<p>
We may link information gathered by passive information collection methods to your Registration Information and other personal information we obtain about you from other sources.  If we cross-match information in this manner, we will treat such cross-matched information as personal information under this Privacy Policy.  Additionally, IP addresses gathered by passive collection methods may be used and disclosed to third parties under the same circumstances as personal information under this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>

In the course of interacting with the Site, you may be given access to the websites of third parties.  The privacy practices of those websites will be described in their own privacy policies, which SIAN advises you to read, and those third party websites are not governed by the Privacy Policy of SIAN. 
</p>
<p>
When users visit particular pages within the Site, personal information may be placed in the URL or in an HTML form POST.  This allows customized features for the user. Users should be aware that other websites visited before entering the Site might place personally identifiable information within a user's URL during visits to those websites, and SIAN has no control over the practices of such websites. Accordingly, some of this information may be logged by a website that collects URL information that the user visits. 
</p>
<h2>How SIAN Uses the User Information</h2>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>
SIAN generally uses personal information for the purposes of the Site and in the course of providing information to various advertisers and other Services. For example, we use registration information and question responses of users to send lead information to our advertisers or advertising brokers, who use the lead information to contact users regarding their products or services.  An advertiser may send and the user may receive contact including postal mail, email, phone calls, and faxes encouraging the users to consume the advertiserï¿½s product or service. 
</p>
<p>
We also may use personal information of users to process transactions on the Site, to provide support for the Services, to otherwise respond to users' requests and inquiries, to maintain a record of dealings with our users, to develop new products and services, and to send information regarding products and services that we or our advertisers think our users might find of interest or useful.  When we use your personal information in our marketing efforts, we provide you with choices (see "Opt-Out," below).
</p>
<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure </h3>

<p>
SIAN does not rent, sell or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy.  We may share personal information about you under the following circumstances:
</p>
<p>
We may provide personal information to advertisers and advertising brokers when you expressly consent to the provision of that personal information by providing information requested on our site in response to an offer.  When you consent to provision to an advertiser of personal information by providing information requested by our site, you also consent to contact by postal mail, fax, phone or email to any of the addresses or numbers that you provide.
</p>
<p>
We may provide personal information, under confidentiality agreements, to third parties who work on behalf of or with SIAN to assist us in performing non-advertising functions necessary to operate our business, such as validation services. 
</p>
<p>
We may pre-populate the forms on third party websites with your personal information.  This personal information is not submitted to the third party website until you submit the personal information to the third party by responding in a way that indicates interest in the offer, such as clicking a submit button.
</p>
<p>
A user's personal information, usage history and other collected information may result in specifically-tailored special offers.
</p>
<h3>Aggregate Non-Identifying Statistical Reports</h3>

<p>
We may also produce aggregate reports for advertisers and other third parties. For example, we may report to advertisers and other third parties the number of users who clicked on an ad, the average length of time users viewed a particular page on the Site or the number of users who visited different portions of the Site. These aggregate reports do not include personal information about users or any specific user's online usage patterns.  We may also provide this aggregate information to third parties for performing optimization of our site.
</p>
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>
Information about our users, including, without limitation, personal information, may be disclosed as part of a merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information could be transferred to third parties as one of SIAN's business assets (each, a "Business Transfer"). We will make reasonable efforts to notify all users of any Business Transfer, and any users so notified may choose to disable any of their Registration Information at that time.
</p>
<h3>How The Site Works</h3>
<p>
During use of the Site, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for special offers in the form of optional advertisements from our sponsors. If you are presented with such an optional advertisement, you can provide information or respond by activating a data entry element to indicate your interest in the offer.  We may pre-populate the webpage of the offer with your personal data, which may then be supplied to the advertiser if you indicate your interest.  When you indicate your interest, SIAN and its affiliates may share some or all of your Registration Information with the sponsors you selected. Do not indicate interest in an offer if you do not wish to send personal information to the advertiser or other provider of that offer. These advertisers may include, among others, direct marketing service providers for promotions, lookup and reference applications, and enhancement services.
</p>
<p>
In addition, you may also be given the opportunity to participate in a special promotion hosted by a third party website. Any personal information you provide in these circumstances may be transferred by the third party website to the appropriate advertiser(s).  Although SIAN may have independently received similar information from your use of the Site, SIAN may not have access to any information that you provide on a website hosted by a third party.  In order to enhance the service we provide, we may pre-populate data fields on a third-party offer form with your Registration Information or other personal information you have provided to SIAN, but this pre-populated information is not submitted to the third party until you indicate interest in an advertisement by activating an associated web control.  We may also provide your personal information in a URL that refers you to the site of the third party.  All information provided to third party entities is then subject to those entities' privacy policies and other applicable policies. We urge you to review each such third party's privacy policy, and other applicable policies, before consenting to the transfer of your personal information in this manner.
</p>
<h3>Third Party Links</h3>

<p>
The Site may also contain links to third party websites.  Links from our Site to other websites or content (whether or not such links are contained in advertisements) do not constitute SIAN's affiliation with or endorsement of such websites or content.  These third-party links are provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over the content or privacy and security practices and policies of such third parties or other sites.  Any personal information you provide on linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third partyï¿½s privacy policy.  We encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when navigating away from the Site.
</p>
<h3>Law Enforcement; Protection of Safety; Enforcement of Terms of Services</h3>
<p>
SIAN may disclose users' personal information where we believe so doing is necessary or appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court or administrative orders or legal process); to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or, at our sole discretion, to investigate, prevent or take action (a) regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, (b) where we deem necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the public, (c) to prevent the violation of the Site's Terms of Service, or (d) to protect the rights or property of SIAN or any third party.
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
We have put into place commercially reasonable security measures in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and alteration of information while it is under our control. However, no data transmitted over the Internet or stored electronically can be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that we collect under this Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<h2>Modifying or Disabling User Information</h2>
<p>
Users may, at any time, choose to disable the information they have submitted to us. This may be done by the following method:

</p>
<p>
If you would like to disable personal information that we maintain about you, please <a href="mailto:getitfree@getitfree.net?Subject=Ad Network Privacy Policy">contact us</a> and state the information that you would like disabled.  We will attempt to accommodate your request, and may contact you to request additional information in connection with or prior to processing your request. Please note that, while your request may result in a disabling of the stored copy of your data, this action will not be propagated to our advertisers.  To change the data that our advertisers have received, you will need to contact them directly. 
</p>
<h2>Opt-Out</h2>
<p>
Once you submit data, as described above, we provide that data to the advertisers that you have selected.  If you do not want information shared, do not submit it.
</p>
<p>
Third parties may independently collect information about users as described in this Privacy Policy. Information collected by these third parties is subject to those third parties' policies governing use and disclosure of personal information. Users should contact those third parties directly if they do not wish to receive communications from them, do not want those third parties to collect information about them or wish to take any other actions with regard to such information. 
</p>
<h2>No Spam Policy</h2>

<p>
We at SIAN are opposed to spam. The Site's Terms of Service prohibit all users from engaging in any activity involving spam on our service, including, without limitation, from uploading, posting, emailing, transmitting or otherwise making available junk mail, commercial advertisements or other forms of commercial solicitation on the Site or through the Services.  Violations may result in immediate termination of the user's license to access the Site and the Services and/or legal action against any spammer.
</p>
<p>
Sending unsolicited email advertisements to or through coreg.smileymedia.com computer systems, will use or cause to be used SIAN servers located in California, Texas and elsewhere. Any unauthorized use of SIAN's computer systems is a violation of the Site's Terms of Service and may violate certain federal and state laws, including, without limitation, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. ï¿½ 1030 et seq.), Section 502 of the California Penal Code and Section 17538.45 of the California Business and Professions Code. Such violations may subject the sender and his or her agents to civil and criminal penalties.
</p>
<h2>Revisions to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
SIAN reserves the right to augment, revise, amend, or modify this Privacy Policy and our other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner. We will post notice on the Site of any revision, amendment, or modification to this Privacy Policy and a user's continued use of the Site or the Services will signify agreement with and affirmative consent to such changes.
</p>
