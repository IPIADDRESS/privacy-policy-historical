<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Smiley Media automatically, or

clickstream data, which is a record of click selections within the Smiley Media
Advertising Network, for all users. For example, we may log a user's Internet
Protocol ("IP") address, operating system, browser type, time and
date of visit and page views. We may collect this information through the use
of server logs, "cookies" and "pixel tags."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Cookies are small data files sent
by a website to a user's browser and hard drive that identify the user's
computer to the website. We may use cookies to provide the Services and to
allow enhanced features, such as recognizing users.<span style="mso-spacerun:

other new features for users as such content and features become available. If
you opt-in to this Privacy Policy, Smiley Media may share, sell, or license
cookies collected from you browser and hard drive to third-party advertisers. These
authorized third parties may link your name, address and e-mail address to
other information which they collect, such as past online/offline purchase
information and Web usage from other sites. These authorized companies are
contractually bound to secure the data they receive.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class="MsoNormal">Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in web

may read cookies.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Pages on the Site may also
contain similar pixel tags that allow us to count users who have visited those
pages, to compile aggregated statistics about Site usage and to deliver
co-branded and other new features and services as they become available. Pixel
tags on the Site may collect information such as a cookie number, time and date
of a page view and a description of the page on which the pixel tag
resides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We may use information
gathered from pixel tags to improve the content of the Site and email messages,
to help us diagnose problems with our servers and other equipment, to
administer the Site, to provide the Services and to provide new or enhanced
features or tailored products or services to our users as they become
available.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Advertisers and other third
parties may place third-party elements, including pixel tags, JavaScript code

</span>These third party elements may be used on the Site to monitor the

other personal information we obtain about you from other sources. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If we cross-match information in this
manner, we will treat such cross-matched information as personal information
under this Privacy Policy. Additionally, user IP address, web browser,
operating system, screen resolution, language, country and visit date are
gathered by passive collection methods for the purpose of ensuring that
advertising offers on the Smiley Media Advertising Network are targeted to user
demographics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This information may

that other websites visited before entering the Site might place personally

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Personal Information<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Smiley Media generally uses
personal information for the purposes of operating the Site and Services and in
the course of providing information to various advertisers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, we use Registration
Information and the question responses of users to send sales lead information
to our advertisers or advertising brokers who use the sales lead information to
contact users regarding the products or services that the user indicated an
interest in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Where a user has
indicated an interest to be contacted by specific advertisers regarding
applicable products, such advertisers may send, and the users may receive,
correspondence, including postal mail, email, telephone calls and faxes
regarding each advertiser's product or service.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We also may use personal
information of users to process transactions on the Site, to provide support
for the Services, to otherwise respond to users' requests and inquiries, to maintain
a record of dealings with our users, to develop new products and services and
to send information regarding products and services that we or our advertisers
think our users might find of interest or useful.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When we use your personal information in our marketing
efforts, we provide you with choices (see "Opt-Out," below).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Information Sharing
and Disclosure<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We may share, license, or sell
your information to third parties for various marketing purposes, including
their online (e.g., email marketing) and offline (e.g., telemarketing, cell
phone, text messaging (where and to the extent permitted by law), skip tracing
and direct mail) marketing programs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Without limiting the foregoing,
by providing Registration Information on the Site, you agree that such act
constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended
Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as amended from time to time
(the "Rule") and applicable state do-not-call regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, notwithstanding that your
telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call
List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to
contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule and the applicable
state do-not-call regulations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We may also transmit your
personal information to advertisers and advertising brokers when you expressly
consent to transmit that personal information by providing information
requested on the Site in response to an offer. When you consent to transmit
your personal information to an advertiser by providing information requested
by the Site, and where you have indicated an interest to be contacted regarding
applicable products, you also consent to being contacted by postal mail, fax,
telephone or email to any of the addresses or numbers that you provide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The personal information transmitted to
advertisers may include any of your Registration Information. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Some third party websites using
the Smiley Media Advertising Network do not initially collect all personal information
necessary to provide users with targeted advertising offers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In such cases, Smiley Media collects
the necessary personal information through an additional registration form
hosted on the Site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The personal
information collected in this manner may include any of the following: first
and last name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, gender and
date of birth. Unless the user declined to share this information with the
applicable third party website from which the user linked to the Site, Smiley
Media may share this additional personal information with that website.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In such cases, the privacy policy of
the originating third party website will govern that website's use of the
additional personal information collected in this manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We may provide personal
information, under confidentiality agreements, to third parties who work on
behalf of, or with, Smiley Media to assist us in performing non-advertising

your interest in the offer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We may
pre-populate the webpage of the offer with your personal data, which may then
be supplied to the advertiser if you indicate your interest. When you indicate

interest in an offer if you do not wish to send personal information to the
advertiser or other provider of that offer.<span style="mso-spacerun:

associated web control. We may also provide your personal information in a URL
that refers you to the website of a third party.<span style="mso-spacerun:
