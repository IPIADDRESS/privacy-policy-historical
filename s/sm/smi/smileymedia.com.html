			<h3>Privacy at Smiley Media, Inc.</h3>

<p>Smiley Media, Inc. values your privacy.  This website, at
www.smileymedia.com (the "Site"), and all subdomains, constitutes the
Smiley Media Advertising Network.  The Smiley Media Advertising Network
allows Internet users to opt-in to advertising offers by sending answers
 to questions and personal information to selected advertisers. Like any
 website for which you register and provide information about yourself
or your opinions, it is advisable to pay attention to your personal
information. At Smiley Media, Inc. we understand this and have established this Privacy
 Policy to explain how information is collected on the Site and how this
 information is used and disclosed. By using the Site or any of the
various services made available to you on the Site (the "Services"), you
 consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Use by Persons Under 13 Years of Age Prohibited</h3>

<p>The Site and the Services are not directed to children and are
intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. All persons
 under 13 years of age are prohibited from registering on the Site and
should not otherwise provide Smiley Media, Inc. with any personal information. We do
not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13
through the Site or the Services. If you believe that a child in your
care has registered on the Site or has otherwise provided us with
personal information, please contact us. We may ask you to provide
additional information to verify your identity and your authority to act
 on the child's behalf before taking appropriate action, if any, to
remove or disable any personal information in our control.  </p>

<h3>User Information Collected by Smiley Media, Inc. on the Site</h3>

<h2>Information Users Voluntarily Provide to Us</h2>

<p>When users access the Site, personal information may be provided to
us in the form of data passed by the site referring them to us, or in
the form of information that we request in one or more registration
forms ("Registration Information"). Registration Information requested
may include, without limitation, the user's first and last name, email
address, mailing address, telephone number, gender, date of birth, and
other personal information. We encourage you to submit this information
so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site.  At
times, Smiley Media, Inc. may combine information about you that we have with
information we obtain from other companies or sources. If so, this
Privacy Policy governs such information.</p>

<p>You may correct or update your information directly on our
registration forms. If your personally identifiable information changes,
 or if you no longer desire the services provided by our advertisers,
please contact our advertisers directly to update or delete your
information pursuant to their privacy policies.</p>

<p>If you opt-in to advertising offers on the Smiley Media Advertising
Network, Smiley Media, Inc. will send your data to the selected advertisers, and these
advertisers may contact you with email messages to the email address
provided by the user during registration, with phone calls, faxes, or
postal mail directed to the postal mailing address that you supplied.
After you opt-in to an advertising offer on the Smiley Media Advertising
 Network, your personal information is subject to the selected
advertisers' policies governing use and disclosure of personal
information.    </p>

<p>Publishers wishing to sign up to use the Smiley Media Advertising
Network may do so through a registration form hosted by Infinity Box,
which owns and operates the website, www.wufoo.com.  Although Infinity
Box owns the data storage, databases, and the Wufoo site, the Smiley Media, Inc.
Privacy Policy governs all data collected through registration forms
hosted on the Wufoo site. Infinity Box does not utilize such data for
marketing or advertising purposes or for any other means of profit.   </p>

<h3>Cookies and Passive Data Collection</h3>

<p>Smiley Media, Inc. automatically, or "passively," may collect certain standard user
information and clickstream data, which is a record of click selections
within the Smiley Media Advertising Network, for all users. For example,
 we may log a user's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, operating system,
 browser type, time and date of visit, and page views. We may collect
this information through the use of server logs, "cookies," and "pixel
tags."</p>

<p>Cookies are small data files sent by a website to a user's browser
and hard drive that identify the user's computer to the website. We may
use cookies on the Site to validate users' sessions on the Site, to
administer the Site, to provide the Services, and to allow enhanced
features, such as recognizing users. We may also use cookies to enable
customizable content and other new features for users as such content
and features become available.</p>

<p>Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in Web pages,
HTML-encoded email messages, and certain other types of content, which
may read cookies.</p>

<p>Pages on the Site may also contain similar pixel tags that allow us
to count users who have visited those pages, to compile aggregated
statistics about site usage, and to deliver co-branded and other new
features and services as they become available. Pixel tags on the Site
may collect information such as a cookie number, time and date of a page
 view and a description of the page on which the pixel tag resides. We
may use information gathered from pixel tags to improve the content of
our Site and email messages, to help us diagnose problems with our
servers and other equipment, to administer the Site, to provide the
Services, and to provide new or enhanced features or tailored products
or services to our users as they become available.</p>

<p>Advertisers and other third parties may place third-party elements,
including pixel tags, JavaScript code, or similar code on the Site, and
may use other tools and techniques, to gather information about users of
 the Site. These third party elements may be used on the Site to monitor
 the effectiveness of advertising or to collect anonymous tracking
information. These third parties may also place cookies on the Site,
which may be used to gather anonymous tracking information and the same
types of information as we collect by using cookies. These cookies may
be placed on the Site in conjunction with pixel tags and pieces of code
placed on the Site by that third party. Information collected by these
third parties in these ways is subject to those third parties' policies
governing use and disclosure of personal information.</p>

<p>We may link information gathered by passive information collection
methods to your Registration Information and other personal information
we obtain about you from other sources. If we cross-match information in
 this manner, we will treat such cross-matched information as personal
information under this Privacy Policy. Additionally, user IP address,
web browser, operating system, screen resolution, language, country, and
 visit date are gathered by passive collection methods for the purpose
of ensuring that advertising offers on the Smiley Media Advertising
Network are targeted to user demographics.  This information may be
disclosed to third parties under the same circumstances as personal
information under this Privacy Policy.         </p>

<p>In the course of interacting with the Site, you may be given access
to the websites of third parties. The privacy practices of those
websites will be described in their own privacy policies, and those
third party websites are not governed by the Privacy Policy of Smiley Media, Inc..   </p>

<p>When users visit particular pages within the Site, personal
information may be placed in the URL or in an HTML form POST. This
allows customized features for the user. Users should be aware that
other websites visited before entering the Site might place personally
identifiable information within a user's URL during visits to those
websites, and Smiley Media, Inc. has no control over the practices of such websites.
Accordingly, some of this information may be logged by a website that
collects URL information that the user visits.</p>

<h3>How Smiley Media, Inc. Uses the User Information</h3>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>Smiley Media, Inc. generally uses personal information for the purposes of the Site
and in the course of providing information to various advertisers and
other Services. For example, we use registration information and
question responses of users to send sales lead information to our
advertisers or advertising brokers who use the sales lead information to
 contact users regarding their products or services. An advertiser may
send and the users may receive correspondence including postal mail,
email, phone calls, and faxes encouraging the users to consume the
advertiser's product or service.</p>

<p>We also may use personal information of users to process transactions
 on the Site, to provide support for the Services, to otherwise respond
to users' requests and inquiries, to maintain a record of dealings with
our users, to develop new products and services, and to send information
 regarding products and services that we or our advertisers think our
users might find of interest or useful. When we use your personal
information in our marketing efforts, we provide you with choices (see
"Opt-Out," below).</p>

<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

<p>We may share, license, or sell your information to third parties for
various marketing purposes, including their online (e.g., e-mail
marketing) and offline (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging,
skip tracing, and direct mail) marketing programs.</p>

<p>We may also transmit your personal information to advertisers and
advertising brokers when you expressly consent to transmit that personal
 information by providing information requested on our site in response
to an offer. When you consent to transmit your personal information to
an advertiser by providing information requested by the Site, you also
consent to being contacted by postal mail, fax, phone, or email to any
of the addresses or numbers you provide.  The personal information
transmitted to advertisers may include any of the following: first and
last name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, gender, and
 date of birth. </p>

<p>Some third party websites using the Smiley Media Advertising Network
do not initially collect all personal information necessary to provide
users with targeted advertising offers.  In such cases, Smiley Media, Inc. collects the
 necessary personal information through an additional registration form
hosted on the Site. The personal information collected in this manner
may include any of the following: first and last name, email address,
mailing address, telephone number, gender, and date of birth. Smiley Media, Inc. may
share this additional personal information with the third party website
from which the user originated.  In such cases, the privacy policy of
the originating third party website will govern that website's use of
the additional personal information collected in this manner.</p>

<p>We may provide personal information, under confidentiality
agreements, to third parties who work on behalf of or with Smiley Media, Inc. to assist
 us in performing non-advertising functions necessary to operate our
business, such as validation services.  </p>

<p>In order to provide targeted advertising offers to you, we may on
occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us with
information from third-party sources: </p>

<u>Verification</u>

<p> We may use third-party services to verify your address and telephone
 number in order to ensure your eligibility to participate in certain
advertising offers. </p>

<u>Enhancement 
 of Profile Information</u>

<p>We may purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our
existing user database, to better target our advertising and to provide
pertinent offers in which we think you would be interested.  To enrich
our profiles of individual customers, we may tie this information to the
 personally identifiable information they have provided to us.</p>

<p>We may pre-populate the forms on third party websites with your
personal information. Smiley Media, Inc. may not show all pre-populated forms to users.
 This personal information is not submitted to the third party website
until you submit the personal information to the third party by
responding in a way that indicates interest in the offer, such as
clicking a submit button.</p>

<p>A user's personal information, usage history, and other collected
information may result in the presentation of specifically tailored
special offers.</p>

<h3>Aggregate Non-Identifying Statistical Reports</h3>

<p>We may also produce aggregate reports for advertisers and other third
 parties. For example, we may report to advertisers and other third
parties the number of users who clicked on an advertising offer, the
average length of time users viewed a particular page on the Site, or
the number of users who visited different portions of the Site. These
aggregate reports do not include personal information about users or any
 specific user's online usage patterns. We may also provide this
aggregate information to third parties for performing optimization of
our site.</p>

<h3>Business Transfers</h3>

<p>Information about our users, including, without limitation, personal
information, may be disclosed as part of a merger, acquisition, debt
financing, or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an
insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which personal information
could be transferred to third parties as one of Smiley Media Inc's business assets
(each, a "Business Transfer"). We will make reasonable efforts to notify
 all users of any Business Transfer, and any users so notified may
choose to disable any of their Registration Information at that time.</p>

<h3>How The Site Works</h3>

<p>During use of the Site, you may be given the opportunity to sign up
for special offers in the form of optional advertisements from our
sponsors. If you are presented with such an optional advertisement, you
can provide information or respond by activating a data entry element to
 indicate your interest in the offer. We may pre-populate the webpage of
 the offer with your personal data, which may then be supplied to the
advertiser if you indicate your interest. When you indicate your
interest, Smiley Media, Inc. and its affiliates may share some or all of your
Registration Information with the sponsors you selected. Do not indicate
 interest in an offer if you do not wish to send personal information to
 the advertiser or other provider of that offer. These advertisers may
include, among others, direct marketing service providers for
promotions, lookup and reference applications, and enhancement services.</p>

<p>In addition, you may also be given the opportunity to participate in a
 special promotion hosted by a third party website. Any personal
information you provide in these circumstances may be transferred by the
 third party website to the appropriate advertiser(s). Although Smiley Media, Inc. may
have independently received similar information from your use of the
Site, Smiley Media, Inc. may not have access to any information that you provide on a
website hosted by a third party. In order to enhance the service we
provide, we may pre-populate data fields on a third-party offer form
with your Registration Information or other personal information you
have provided to Smiley Media, Inc., but this pre-populated information is not
submitted to the third party until you indicate interest in an
advertisement by activating an associated web control. We may also
provide your personal information in a URL that refers you to the site
of the third party. All information provided to third-party entities is
then subject to those entities' privacy policies and other applicable
policies. We urge you to review each such third party's privacy policy,
and other applicable policies, before consenting to the transfer of your
 personal information in this manner.</p>

<h3>Third Party Links</h3>

<p>The Site may also contain links to third party websites. Links from
our Site to other websites or content (whether or not such links are
contained in advertisements) do not constitute Smiley Media, Inc.'s affiliation with or
 endorsement of such websites or content. These third-party links are
provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over the
content or privacy and security practices and policies of such third
parties or other sites. Any personal information you provide on linked
pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that
third party's privacy policy. We encourage all users to read the privacy
 policies of each and every website visited when navigating away from
the Site.</p>

<p>The Site may be presented in a frame that closely resembles the
design of one of Smiley Media, Inc.'s partner websites.  The Site may be presented in
this manner to improve user experience by seamlessly integrating the
Smiley Media Advertising Network into the originating website's design.
 </p>

<p>The Site may also contain frames within which third-party advertiser
websites are presented.  If users choose to interact with third-party
advertiser websites presented within frames on the Smiley Media
Advertising Network, any personal data submitted to those third-party
advertiser websites will be governed by the third-party advertisers'
privacy policies. </p>

<h3>Law Enforcement; Protection of Safety; Enforcement of Terms of
Services</h3>

<p>Smiley Media, Inc. may disclose users' personal information where we believe doing
so is necessary or appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., to respond
to subpoenas, court or administrative orders, or legal process); to
establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
or, at our sole discretion, to investigate, prevent, or take action (a)
regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, (b) where we deem
necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the public, (c) to
prevent the violation of the Site's Terms of Service, or (d) to protect
the rights or property of Smiley Media, Inc. or any third party.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>We have implemented commercially reasonable security measures in an
effort to prevent loss, misuse, and alteration of information while it
is under our control. However, no data transmitted over the Internet or
stored electronically can be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive
to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security
of any information that we collect under this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Smiley Media, Inc. also protects user information off-line. All of our users'
information is restricted in our offices or data centers. Only employees
 who need the information to perform a specific job are granted
passwords to access personally identifiable information. Furthermore,
all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
  Our employees are regularly notified and/or reminded about the
importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our
users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store
personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment,
 behind a locked cage</p>

<p>Smiley Media, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of our users, and we will
continue review and implement new technologies as necessary to maintain
the security of our networks and servers.  </p>

advertisers. To change or delete the data our advertisers have received,
 you will need to contact them directly.</p>

<h3>Opt-Out</h3>

 or submitted information under more than one e-mail account, you must
submit separate unsubscribe requests for each account.</p>

<p>Third parties may independently collect information about users as
described in this Privacy Policy. Information collected by these third
parties is subject to those third parties' policies governing use and
disclosure of personal information. Users should contact those third
parties directly if they do not wish to receive communications from
them, do not want those third parties to collect information about them,
 or wish to take any other actions with regard to such information.</p>

<h3>No-Spam Policy</h3>

<p>Smiley Media, Inc. is opposed to spam. Smiley Media, Inc. prohibits all users from engaging in any
activity involving spam on our service, including, without limitation,
from uploading, posting, emailing, transmitting, or otherwise making
available junk mail, commercial advertisements, or other forms of
commercial solicitation on the Site or through the Services. Violations
may result in immediate termination of the user's license to access the
Site and the Services and/or legal action against any spammer.</p>

<p>Sending unsolicited email advertisements to or through
www.smileymedia.com computer systems, will use or cause to be used Smiley Media, Inc.
servers located in California, Texas, and elsewhere. Any unauthorized
use of Smiley Media, Inc.'s computer systems is a violation of Smiley Media, Inc. policy and may
violate certain federal and state laws, including, without limitation,
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1030 et seq.),
Section 502 of the California Penal Code and Section 17538.45 of the
California Business and Professions Code. Such violations may subject
the sender and his or her agents to civil and criminal penalties.</p>

appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we
 use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  </p>
