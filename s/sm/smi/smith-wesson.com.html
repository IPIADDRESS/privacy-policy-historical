<p class="bdytxt">
This Privacy Policy ("this Policy") describes certain policies of SMITH &amp; WESSON CORPORATION and its affiliates ("we," "us" or "S&amp;W") with respect to its collection and use of certain information.  This Policy applies to personal information collected by us online through our website.  To the extent that we collect personal information through other means, our policies may be different from those described in this Policy.
</p><p class="bdytxt">
1.	Collection and Use of Information.  When you access our website we may collect certain anonymous information relating to such access which allows us to provide a better website experience.  In addition, if you provide us with information through our website (for example, in connection with our product registration service), we retain that information for the purpose for which it is provided.  We may provide information to third-parties who assist us to provide requested products and services such as shipping companies who deliver requested products.  We may also use information that we obtain to provide you with information on other products and services that we believe you might be interested in.  From time to time, we may provide certain information that we obtain to others who provide products and services that we believe you might be interested in.  It is our intention to provide such information only to parties who we believe are trustworthy but please note that such parties may have different privacy policies.  We do not knowingly collect information about children under the age of 13.  In the event that we become aware that we have been provided information about a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our records.
</p><p class="bdytxt">
2.	Limitations on Use of Information.  Where determined to be practical, we provide certain opportunities to express preferences regarding our use of information that you provide such as opportunities to decline to receive informational emails.  If you want us to remove information regarding you from our records, please contact us by mail: 2100 Roosevelt Ave, Springfield, MA 01102-2208.  You must describe the information that you want removed in sufficient detail to allow us to locate that information in our records.  Please note that a request to remove information may prevent us from providing certain products or services to you.  If you want to update or correct any information that we have about you in our records, please contact us as described above in this paragraph.  You must describe the information in sufficient detail to allow us to make the appropriate update or correction.  We cannot be responsible for verifying the authenticity of requests to remove, update or correct information.  However, we reserve the right to refuse to modify information if we request proof of authority and the requesting party does not furnish appropriate proof of authority.  Please note that we can only modify information in our records and do not have the ability to modify third-party records.
</p><p class="bdytxt">
3.	Security.  We take precautions that we deem reasonable and appropriate to maintain the security of personal information in our possession.  However, we cannot assume responsibility for a compromise of security.  We do not maintain control over information in the possession of third-parties.
</p><p class="bdytxt">
4.	Policy Changes.  From time to time we may use information in ways not previously described in this Policy.
