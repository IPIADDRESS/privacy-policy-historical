    readable format and then translate it back into human readable format for
    you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred
    to as a "Policy Summary". To the extent that this Policy Summary
    is inconsistent with, fails to address or addresses an issue not raised in,
    our Privacy Policy, you should rely on our Privacy Policy as it is the controlling
    authority.</p>
