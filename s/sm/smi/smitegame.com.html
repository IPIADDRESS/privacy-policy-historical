                                <p><strong>What about cookies  and other technologies?</strong></p>
                                <p>We may use cookies and other technologies to collect  demographic information, personalize your experience on our Site and monitor  advertisements and other activities. Cookies are small files downloaded to your  computer to track movements and behavior within web sites. Certain of our web  sites may use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you do  not see the same ad repeatedly.&nbsp; Also, we  may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and for other  purposes. For example, certain of our web sites may use "cookies" or  other methods to monitor web site usage. We may collect information on what  games are played, how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or  links are clicked. We may link cookie information to personal information. </p>
                                <p>Certain of our web sites use an outside ad company to  display ads. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads  are collected by our ad companies, and Hi-Rez does not have access to this  information. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you  visit a web site. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when  cookies are being sent.&nbsp; However some  areas of our Site will not function properly if you do so. </p>
                                <p>Other technologies used in our web sites include clear GIFs and  IP address logging. Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small  graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an e-mail  message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very  small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page,  document or e-mail message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal  information about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical  usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page.  We may correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and  for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages. </p>
                                <p>Hi-Rez also maintains log files which contain Internet  Protocol ("IP") addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is  assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we  only use log files to monitor traffic on our web sites, to report aggregate  information to our advertisers and third party service providers and to  troubleshoot technical problems. In the event of user abuse of our Site;  however, we may block certain IP addresses or console IDs provided by our  licensed hardware manufacturers. IP addresses and console IDs may be used to  personally identify you in order to enforce our Online Terms of Service and Use  Agreement. </p>
                                <p><strong>What happens to the  information provided?</strong></p>
                                <p>Hi-Rez does not disclose any personal information about  children under 18 years of age who have registered on any of our web sites to  third parties, regardless of parental consent, or share or disclose personal  information other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, provided however,  that in the event of a merger, acquisition, asset sale or in the unlikely event  of bankruptcy, visitor and user information (including, without limitation,  personal information) maintained by Hi-Rez may be transferred to its successors  or assigns.</p>
                                <p>Users who register for an account with Hi-Rez may register  for other services from our Site from time to time.&nbsp; If you opt in to any of these services, we  may collect additional information including, without limitation, information  requested by a service provider and pass this information, together with all  other registration information (including, without limitation, personal  information), to that service provider. Use of your personal information by a  service provider will be governed by that service provider's privacy policy and  terms of service. We may also retain any additional information collected for  use in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Participation in these other related services  is optional and is not required&nbsp; to  access our Site. </p>
                                <p>The personal information you provide will allow us to alert  you to new products, features and enhancements; special offers; upgrade  opportunities; and contests and events of interest. We may send e-mails that  may contain information regarding third-party products or services; however,  this does not mean that we have provided or traded your personal information to  any party. </p>
                                <p>We may use survey information in marketing surveys to select  and direct advertising that is more likely to be of interest to a particular  user of an account with Hi-Rez. This information may be transmitted to an ad  server owned by an advertising company to match account holders with ads that  they are more likely to be interested in. However, we do not disclose any  account holder’s personal information to our advertisers without the holder’s  consent. Participation in such surveys is entirely optional. We may share  aggregate consumer data (which does not contain personal information) with the  advertising companies or with any other third-party, and we may use such  information for any legitimate business purpose in our sole discretion. </p>
                                <p>We may use your personal information for our internal  marketing and demographic studies, so we can consistently improve our web sites  to better meet our visitors' and users’ needs. In addition, we may use your  personal information to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to  comply with an order from a judicial or government entity or other competent  authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to  address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations,  users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage.&nbsp; Finally, we may also disclose personal  information to law enforcement, or the appropriate judicial or civil  authorities. </p>
                                <p><strong>Where is the  information held?</strong></p>
                                <p>Currently, Hi-Rez maintains and stores your personal  information on servers located within the United States.&nbsp; This may not apply to Hi-Rez’s third party  providers (including, without limitation, Valve Corporation and our third party  payment processors).&nbsp; In the event that  Hi-Rez becomes a global organization, some of the computer systems on which  Hi-Rez collects, stores, and uses the information it collects or receives may  be based outside the United States.&nbsp;  Therefore, your personal information may be transferred to, used, processed  or held by Hi-Rez in the United States and in other countries, including  countries both in and outside the European Union, and used for the purposes set  out in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; You hereby  consent to such use.</p>
                                <p><strong>Opt-out Provision</strong></p>
                                <p>When we first collect information about you, we will offer  you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personal information shared with  parties outside of Hi-Rez or its Affiliates or its third party providers (such  as Valve Corporation and our payment processors), except to the extent required  by law, court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement  authority.&nbsp; If you choose to have your  name removed from our mailing list, you can do so by contacting our Data  Privacy Officer at privacy@hirezstudios.com. </p>
                                <p><strong>Safeguarding Your  Personal Information</strong></p>
                                <p>We will only collect and use personal information in  accordance with this Privacy Policy to the extent deemed reasonably necessary  to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will use commercially  reasonable physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the  security, integrity, accuracy and privacy of the information you have provided.  In addition, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties to whom  we transfer any personal information will provide commercially reasonable  protection of that information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the  security of any information you transmit to Hi-Rez, and you do so at your own  risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Hi-Rez makes  commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of such information on  our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such  information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of  any of our physical, technical, managerial or other safeguards. </p>
