Once a child states that his/her age is under 13, we do not collect or store any personally identifiable information such as name, address or email address. Teenagers under the age of 18 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review this Privacy Policy and to contact us if they would like to raise any concerns.

What about cookies and other technologies?

We may use cookies and other technologies to collect demographic information, personalize your experience on our Site and monitor advertisements and other activities. Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to track movements and behavior within web sites. Certain of our web sites may use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you do not see the same ad repeatedly. Also, we may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and for other purposes. For example, certain of our web sites may use “cookies” or other methods to monitor web site usage. We may collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. We may link cookie information to personal information.

Certain of our web sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad companies, and Hi-Rez does not have access to this information. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a web site. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However some areas of our Site will not function properly if you do so.

Other technologies used in our web sites include clear GIFs and IP address logging. Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an e-mail message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or e-mail message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We may correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.

Hi-Rez also maintains log files which contain Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we only use log files to monitor traffic on our web sites, to report aggregate information to our advertisers and third party service providers and to troubleshoot technical problems. In the event of user abuse of our Site; however, we may block certain IP addresses or console IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. IP addresses and console IDs may be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Online Terms of Service and Use Agreement.

What happens to the information provided?

Hi-Rez does not disclose any personal information about children under 18 years of age who have registered on any of our web sites to third parties, regardless of parental consent, or share or disclose personal information other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, provided however, that in the event of a merger, acquisition, asset sale or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, visitor and user information (including, without limitation, personal information) maintained by Hi-Rez may be transferred to its successors or assigns.

Users who register for an account with Hi-Rez may register for other services from our Site from time to time. If you opt in to any of these services, we may collect additional information including, without limitation, information requested by a service provider and pass this information, together with all other registration information (including, without limitation, personal information), to that service provider. Use of your personal information by a service provider will be governed by that service provider’s privacy policy and terms of service. We may also retain any additional information collected for use in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Participation in these other related services is optional and is not required to access our Site.

The personal information you provide will allow us to alert you to new products, features and enhancements; special offers; upgrade opportunities; and contests and events of interest. We may send e-mails that may contain information regarding third-party products or services; however, this does not mean that we have provided or traded your personal information to any party.

We may use survey information in marketing surveys to select and direct advertising that is more likely to be of interest to a particular user of an account with Hi-Rez. This information may be transmitted to an ad server owned by an advertising company to match account holders with ads that they are more likely to be interested in. However, we do not disclose any account holder’s personal information to our advertisers without the holder’s consent. Participation in such surveys is entirely optional. We may share aggregate consumer data (which does not contain personal information) with the advertising companies or with any other third-party, and we may use such information for any legitimate business purpose in our sole discretion.

We may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can consistently improve our web sites to better meet our visitors’ and users’ needs. In addition, we may use your personal information to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a judicial or government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage. Finally, we may also disclose personal information to law enforcement, or the appropriate judicial or civil authorities.

Where is the information held?

Currently, Hi-Rez maintains and stores your personal information on servers located within the United States. This may not apply to Hi-Rez’s third party providers (including, without limitation, Valve Corporation and our third party payment processors). In the event that Hi-Rez becomes a global organization, some of the computer systems on which Hi-Rez collects, stores, and uses the information it collects or receives may be based outside the United States. Therefore, your personal information may be transferred to, used, processed or held by Hi-Rez in the United States and in other countries, including countries both in and outside the European Union, and used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to such use.

Opt-out Provision

In addition, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties to whom we transfer any personal information will provide commercially reasonable protection of that information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Hi-Rez, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Hi-Rez makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of such information on our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, managerial or other safeguards.

If Hi-Rez learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Hi-Rez may post a notice on its Site if a security breach occurs.

We will then review, update or remove information as appropriate within a commercially reasonable time frame after receiving such notice from you.
