Such information and data will also be used to administer our business, the site, and our services in a manner consistent with this privacy statement, the Terms and Conditions that govern your use of this site and all applicable laws, rules, regulations, or other legal obligations.

<br><br>
<a name="aggregate"></a><span class="h12s">Aggregate Information </span><br>
If you anonymously visit or browse the site without registering or logging on with a username, password or other registration code, we do not collect your personal information unless you disclose it to us (e.g., e-mail address). We may collect aggregate, technical information that tracks site use including browser type, IP address, domain name, number or type of pages visited and time spent on the site. We may use such information in a variety of ways including analyzing trends, visitor interests, or to improve the site.
<br><br>





<a name="privacy"></a><span class="h12s">Privacy Preferences </span><br>
Your browser software may contain a feature intended to notify you of the cookie policies of the websites you visit. For example, the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Internet Explorer 6 browser software contained in Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Windows<sup>®</sup> XP contains such a cookie- filtering device commonly known as P3P. General information about P3P can be found at www.w3.org/P3P. This site has attempted to be compatible with the P3P privacy-filtering tool. However, P3P is still an evolving standard and therefore, we are not responsible for any problems you may experience when using a P3P filter, or any discrepancies between the machine-coded privacy statements which are read by the P3P tool and our human readable policies that you see referenced here on this site including this privacy statement and the Citigroup <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citigroup/privacy/" target="_new">
Privacy</a> statement, which are the controlling documents to which you should refer if you have questions about privacy and this site.
<br><br>


<a name="electronic_authentication"></a><span class="h12s">Electronic Authentication</span><br> 
Collection and use of information about you for pattern recognition and other authentication procedures are part of the log on process for clients and guests registered to use the site.  The process is intended to assess the authenticity of a request by registered users to access, transact business through, or otherwise use the site.   A combination of multiple authentication elements about you such as your individual and user information, transactional data, session surveillance, device fingerprint, IP information, and pattern recognition may be collected and used by us in a manner that will generally be transparent to you during your sessions on the site.  If the authentication elements do not meet our satisfaction at any time as determined by us in our sole discretion you may be required to pass through additional authentication assessments such as supplying specific answers to challenge questions or other procedures.  We will collect and use information from or about you for such assessments, procedures and other administrative and business reasons as we may determine from time to time.  


<br><br>


<a name="online"></a><span class="h12s">Online Advertising </span><br>
Smith Barney online advertisements may be posted by other companies on third party sites that carry our advertising. These companies may set cookies and use related technology, such as encoded URLs or other tracking mechanisms that may note how Internet users respond to an online advertisement. For example, browsers that click on an online advertisement may be redirected to our site with an encoded URL or other tracking technology that may collect and store information about site visits, time spent, or a specific advertisement. Generally reported as aggregate and anonymous data, such information can help us understand for example the performance of online advertising. Third party sites that show our online advertising are often independent businesses that provide their own privacy statements. We are not responsible for such statements or sites. You should always review the privacy representations of those third party sites that you visit before you use them and particularly before you share personal information.    
<br><br>


<a name="other"></a><span class="h12s">Other Sites and Services</span><br>
This site may contain links to other Internet sites not under our direction or control. This privacy statement does not apply to those sites. We are not responsible for such sites, cannot control how such sites use personal information, cookies or other data, and their representations do not apply to this site. You should always review the privacy representations of those sites that you link to before you use them and particularly before you share personal information. If you use other sections of this site that have additional privacy statements (e.g., My Accounts), those apply in addition to this statement to the use of that section or service as described.  
<br><br>
Our <i>Young Investors Network</i> section of this site does not collect personally identifiable information. The information available on the Young Investors Network is solely for educational purposes. Those who register to use the educational calculators and information available on the Young Investors Network sections of the site are not required to provide or asked for an e-mail address or other information that could identify them in any way.
