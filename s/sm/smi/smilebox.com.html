<h2>Our Use of the Information</h2>
<p>Perion gathers Information in order to better understand how users, as a group, use the software and the various features thereof, as well as to help Perion tailor offerings to user groups with specific profiles, and to conduct market research. The parameters and the usage patterns may be used in the aggregate for commercial purposes, including without limitation, for marketing, co-registration to other services, promotional activities or any other activity, including, without limitation, the protection of Perion’s proprietary and other rights all subject to the provisions herein. Perion will process the Information only for specific and limited purposes. We ask for and collect data that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for those purposes.

You can decline to submit personally identifiable information, in which case Perion may not be able to provide you with Services<strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Perion will only use personally identifiable information to create aggregate, non-personal reports about the Users of the Service, and to generate aggregate statistical studies and conduct research related to the Services and the use of the Website and provide Users with certain content that may be of interest to that User based on the Information. We use and store this data only on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us to determine how and the extent to which certain parts of our Website and the Services are used.</p>
<p>Except as expressly set forth herein and/or as necessary to perform the functions of the Service, Perion will not share, sell or lease any personally identifiable information about any User to any third party for any secondary purposes without that User’s permission.</p>
<p>Perion only shares your personally identifiable information with other companies or individuals in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have your consent.</li>
<li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing on our behalf.</li>
<li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information  is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request,<br>
(b) enforce applicable agreements and/or their terms, including investigation of potential violations thereof,<br>
(c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Perion, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>

<p>A User may review and update his personal information provided by him by accessing the Software settings.  We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information is kept accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our Users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. Upon receipt of your written request and enough information to permit us to identify you, we will disclose to you the information we hold about you. We will also correct, amend or delete any personal information that is inaccurate and notify any third party recipients of the necessary changes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required.

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>“Cookies” are pieces of information that are placed on an individual’s computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Service and the Website. Perion may use cookies to save certain information about a User and others who visit the Website, in order to facilitate and enhance future activities with the Services and/or Website. Perion does not use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to the Service. Perion currently contracts with several online partners to help manage and optimize the Services and measure the effectiveness of its advertising and how visitors use the Website. To do this, Perion uses Web beacons and cookies provided by Perion’s marketing companies on the Website. The type of information Perion collects includes the User’s IP address (as further described below), pages visited, the product codes and prices that visitors purchase and coupons that were used during purchase. This information helps Perion learn things such as what pages are most attractive to visitors of the Website, which of Perion’s products most interest its customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.</p>
<p>We may use an outside advertising company to display advertisements on the Website and Services. These third parties also may use first-party and third-party cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies to, among other things, enable such third parties to record which ads your browser has loaded and which site pages you may have been viewing when the ads were delivered or accessed. Use of such third-party sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those third parties. The advertisement company may also collect cookies received with outside ad banners. In addition, we may use third party advertisers to serve or track advertisements on websites. Such parties may use non-personal  information about your visits to the Website and Services and other websites in  order to serve advertisements targeted to your interests expressed during those  visits. We do not have access to information that would confirm the use of cookies by the advertising company. Perion does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. By using any Perion Services, you have affirmatively consented to the collection of information and cookies as described above.</p>
<p>Perion makes use of  Remarketing Lists for Google Analytics for Display Advertisers. You can opt out  of customized Google Display Network ads by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/?hl=en&amp;sig=ACi0TChOOuCVSZTGuMfxmrpygItW8OnlT85VRo8Ir3zhtwDd_re8q1G5-fIJEcd-Wdi2636O-WhxValkfcpJqD9zlFa19IeYCQ">Google  Ads Preferences Manager</a>.</p>
<h2>IP Addresses</h2>
<p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer when using the Internet. Web servers can automatically identify individual computers by their IP address. Perion may collect IP addresses to: Facilitate system administration; Diagnose system problems; Report aggregate User information; and Avoid hacking attacks on the Perion server. Perion does not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information, even if such information is voluntarily provided by a User.</p>
<h2>Other Web Sites and Links</h2>
<p>The Services may contain links to other Web sites. Perion is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.  Some of these offerings are provided by third parties who may provide you with additional information and choices about your privacy.
