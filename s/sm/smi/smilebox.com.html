<p><strong><u>Children under 13.</u></strong></p>
<p>
The Software &amp; Services are not intended for users under the age of 13 and you hereby represent that you are at least 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect, use, share or disclose any personal information from children under the age of 13. We reserve the right to request proof of age at any stage, so that we can verify that minors under the age of thirteen (13) are not using the Software &amp; Services.</p>
 
<p>We advise parents and guardians to regularly monitor their children's use of email and other online communications and activities. Control tools that create a safer online environment for children are available from third party online services and software providers. </p>
<p>
In the event that it comes to our knowledge that a person under the age of thirteen (13) is using the Smilebox Software, we will prohibit and block such a user from accessing the Software &amp; Services and will make all efforts to promptly delete any PII with regard to such user, as applicable.</p>
<p>
If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her PII without your consent, please contact us as provided in this Privacy Policy and we will take the necessary steps to remove that information from our database.</p>

<p><strong><u>Access.</u></strong></p> 
<p>
You may send us a request to access the PII that we collect through your use of the Software &amp; Services. In such case, we may require that you provide us with additional information to verify your identity.</p>

<p><strong><u>Data Retention.</u></strong></p> 
<p>
We retain the information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as necessary to fulfill our business and/or operational purposes or comply with a legal request. We may also choose to anonymize parts of the information we collect so that it can no longer be identifiable or attributable to any person if we want to keep it for longer periods of time.</p>

<p><strong><u>Transfer of Data Outside Your Territory.</u></strong></p> 
<p>
The Software &amp; Services work over the Internet. We may store and process information in various locations throughout the globe. If you are a resident of a European Union Member State or another jurisdiction where transfer of your PII to another jurisdiction requires your consent, then you hereby provide us with your express consent to such transfer of your data.</p>

<p><strong><u>Information Security.</u></strong></p>
<p>
We implement measures to secure your PII that we collect in order to minimize the risks of damage, loss of information, and unauthorized access or use of information. However, these measures are unable to provide absolute information security. Therefore, although we make efforts to secure your PII, we cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that the Software &amp; Services and its databases are immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unauthorized interceptions, access or other kinds of abuse and misuse.</p>

<p><strong><u>Do Not Track.</u></strong></p>
<p>
Do Not Track is a privacy preference that can be configured in certain web browsers (the "<strong>DNT Feature</strong>"); the DNT Feature, when enabled on a web browser, signals the websites you visit that you do not want certain information about the websites visited collected. As the Internet industry is in the process of defining how to interpret signals sent by the DNT Features, Smilebox does not currently respond or recognize DNT Feature signals. </p>

<p><strong><u>Changes to This Privacy Policy.</u></strong></p> 
<p>
We may, from time to time, change this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to visit and review this Policy frequently to stay informed. Prior to any material change to this Privacy Policy, Smilebox will present you with a detailed notificationof such change. Other changes, including amendments made to the Policy to comply with legal requirements, will become effective immediately upon their initial posting. Smilebox will also update the "Last updated” date at the end of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Software &amp; Services after any change takes effect, will indicate your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any of the amended terms, you must avoid any further use of the Software &amp; Services.</p>
