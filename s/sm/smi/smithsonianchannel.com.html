				SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM is committed to protecting the privacy of its visitors and has prepared the following statement to inform users how personally identifying information and non-personally identifying information is gathered from our website and used by SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM. SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM encourages its website users to be smart about choosing when, and to whom, to release information online. This policy may be updated from time to time, so please check back periodically. We will notify you of significant changes by prominently posting them at our site, or by sending an e-mail to the primary address specified in your account. Please note that SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM is intended for use by United States residents only and, therefore, SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM's Privacy Policy is specifically directed only towards residents of the United States.<br><br> 
			
			<span class="copybold">NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</span><br>
			Certain non-personally identifiable information about our visitors is collected by the standard operation of SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM's internet servers and through the use of "cookie" technology (as described below), such as the type of internet browser you are using and the domain name of your internet service provider, where you go within the site, how much time you spend in any particular area and what you buy.<br><br> 
			
			<span class="copybold">COOKIES</span><br>
			A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable by you require that you accept cookies. Generally, we use cookies to:<br>
			1.	Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services. SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM may also use cookies to store your zip code for other services.<br>
			2.	Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.<br>
			3.	Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings.<br>
			4.	Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of the SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM web site you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites.<br>
			Advertisers that serve ads onto SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM may also use their own cookies.<br>
			You have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM services that require registration in order to participate. These services include (but are not limited to): program information e-mails, participating in any loyalty or incentive programs and customizing your home page.<br><br> 
			
			Information collected by the standard operation of SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM's internet servers and through the use of cookies is analyzed by SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM only in aggregate form and is used to improve the content of our website, to tailor the content and/or layout to consumer trends and to notify users about updates to the site. SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM reserves the right to disclose or otherwise utilize this information in aggregate form, for any purpose, in its sole judgment.<br><br> 
			
			Log data collected on web servers both within SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM's control and under the confidential control of SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM's third party ad service provider(s) supplies SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM with aggregate information about the number of visits to different pages on our site. This information is not personally identifiable information and is used by SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM to improve the content of our website.<br><br>
			
			<span class="copybold">PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</span><br>
			SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM also collects personally identifiable information (such as your name, street address, telephone number and e-mail address) from voluntary submissions as part of site registration, sweepstakes, contests, and other online promotions, when you place an order for merchandise, complete a survey that we use for research purposes, or when you report a problem with our site or one of our services. We also enable users to provide their mobile phone numbers and carriers so that they can sign up for wireless updates and other promotions. In addition, if you contact SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM, we may keep a record of that correspondence.<br><br> 
			
			Personally identifiable information will be used by SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM (1) to process your requests (e.g., register you for a contest or sweepstakes or fulfill your merchandise order); (2) to communicate with you or personalize the site based on your stated interests and preferences or make related offers to you; (3) to administer the site or serve you when you have questions or problems; and/or (4) as may, in SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM's sole judgment, be required by any applicable laws, rules or regulations or the Terms and Conditions applicable to this website.<br><br> 
			
			Personally identifiable information will be shared with third parties to further the purpose for which you provide such information (e.g., to process your subscription request or merchandise order) or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of SMITHSONIANCHANNEL.COM or its affiliates or subscribers or to comply with legal or regulatory obligations. In addition, we may transfer information to a third party in the event of corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets).<br><br>
			
			Agents and contractors of [The Smithsonian Channel] who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.<br><br> 
			
			Currently, we do not share personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing purposes without your prior permission.<br><br>
