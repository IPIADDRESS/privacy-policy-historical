    <b>FINANCIAL INSIGHT TECHNOLOGY, INC</b> ("<b>Company</b>") is committed to protecting
    your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding
    the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our website, located at
    www.SmartAsset.com (the "<b>Site</b>") and related services (collectively, "<b>Services</b>").

    <br><br>

    <b>1. USER CONSENT.</b> By submitting Personal Data through our website, Products, or related

    services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the
    processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

    <br><br>

    <b>2. A NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN.</b> We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors
    who are under the age of 13.

    <br><br>

    <b>3. A NOTE TO USERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.</b> Your Personal Data may be
    processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United
    States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws
    in your country. <b>BY USING OUR SITE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL DATA THROUGH
        OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
        PERSONAL DATA ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</b>

    <br><br>
    <b>4. TYPES OF DATA WE COLLECT.</b> Company collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data

    from you when you visit our site, when you send us information or communications, and/or
    when you download and use our Products. "<b>Personal Data</b>" means data that allows someone to
    identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail
    address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to
    any of the foregoing data. "<b>Anonymous Data</b>" means data that is not associated with or linked
    to your Personal Data. Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons.
    We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
    <br><br>

    <b>Personal Data You Provide to Us.</b> We collect Personal Data from you, such as <b>your email
        address</b> when you <b>provide it voluntarily on the Site</b>. If you provide us feedback or
    contact us via e-mail (e.g., in response to an employment opportunity posted on our
    website), we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content
    included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit
    to us, such as a resume. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect
    additional profile information. When you post messages on the message boards of our
    website, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and
    other users will be able to see it. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you
    provide to us voluntarily, such as <b>your Twitter name or Facebook profile</b>. We may
    also collect Personal Data, such as demographic information from you via the Products
    or at other points in our website that state that Personal Data is being collected.
    <br><br>

    <b>Personal Data Collected via Technology.</b> To make our Site, products, and related services
    more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider)
    collect Personal Data from you, including <b>your IP address or HTTP referrer</b>. We
    also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource
    Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the
    solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed. Like most
    Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each

    time you visit our website or access your account on our network. "<b>Cookies</b>" are small
    pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are
    viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close
    your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete
    them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website.
    Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If
    you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly.

    <br><br>

    <b>Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites.</b> We have created, and may offer You,
    interfaces that allow You to connect with social networking websites such as Facebook
    and Twitter ("SN Sites") through our Site. We will work with the SN Site's application
    protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows You
    to authorize us to access Your account on that SN Site on Your behalf. In order to
    provide this authorization, You will not provide us with Your user name or password
    to the SN Site, but You will need to log-in to that SN Site directly through our Site.
    Once authorized by You, the SN Site will provide us a token that allows the SN Site to
    recognize us when we ask, on Your behalf, for access to Your account information or
    to post information. You will be able to revoke our access to any SN Site at any time by
    amending the appropriate settings from within Your account settings on the applicable
    SN Site, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide You.

    <br><br>

    <b>5. USE OF YOUR DATA.</b>
    <br><br>

    <b>General Use.</b> In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests
    that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. Company uses your Personal Data in

            to learn how to opt-out.
    </li></ul>

    <br>
    <b>Creation of Anonymous Data.</b> We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data
    by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable
    to you. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that
    we may enhance the content of our Products and services and improve site navigation.
    Company reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to Third Party
    Companies in its discretion.

    <br><br>
    <b>Feedback.</b> If you provide feedback on the Site, Services or any of our products to us, we
    may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback
    with your Personal Data. Company will collect any information contained in such
    communication and will treat the Personal Data in such communication in accordance
    with this Privacy Policy.

    <br><br>

    <b>6. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA.</b>

    <br><br>
    <b>Affiliates.</b> Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint
    ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "<b>Affiliates</b>"),
    we may in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Data with these
    Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

    Personal Data collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding
    your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
    <br><br>

    <b>Other Disclosures.</b> Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as
    described below), Company may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith
    that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to
    subpoenas or warrants served on Company; or (b) protect or defend the rights or
    property of Company or users of the Products or related services.

    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    Personal and/or Anonymous Data Collected by Third Parties.

    We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from other sources like telephone
    or fax, or from companies that provide our products or services by way of a co-branded
    or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our
    website ("<b>Third Party Companies</b>"). Our Third Party Companies may supply us with
    Personal Data, such as <b>your email address</b>, in order to help us establish the account.
    We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via
    our website in order to improve the products and services we provide.

    <br><br>

    websites, is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other
    website or location or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave our
    site and go to another site. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Data

    outside websites.

    do not generally sell, trade, share, or rent the Personal Data collected from our services
