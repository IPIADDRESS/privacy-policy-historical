<b>FINANCIAL INSIGHT TECHNOLOGY, INC</b> ("<b>Company</b>") is committed to protecting
your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding
the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our website, located at
www.SmartAsset.com (the "<b>Site</b>") and related services (collectively, "<b>Services</b>").

<br><br>

<b>1. USER CONSENT.</b> By submitting Personal Data through our website, Products, or related

services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the
processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

<br><br>

<b>2. A NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN.</b> We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors
who are under the age of 13.

<br><br>

<b>3. A NOTE TO USERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.</b> Your Personal Data may be
processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United
States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws
in your country. <b>BY USING OUR SITE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL DATA THROUGH
OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
PERSONAL DATA ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</b>

<br><br>
<b>4. TYPES OF DATA WE COLLECT.</b> Company collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data

from you when you visit our site, when you send us information or communications, and/or
when you download and use our Products. "<b>Personal Data</b>" means data that allows someone to
identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail
address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to
any of the foregoing data. "<b>Anonymous Data</b>" means data that is not associated with or linked
to your Personal Data. Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons.
We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
<br><br>

<b>Personal Data You Provide to Us.</b> We collect Personal Data from you, such as <b>your email
address</b> when you <b>provide it voluntarily on the Site</b>. If you provide us feedback or
contact us via e-mail (e.g., in response to an employment opportunity posted on our
website), we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content
included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit
to us, such as a resume. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect
additional profile information. When you post messages on the message boards of our
website, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and
other users will be able to see it. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you
provide to us voluntarily, such as <b>your Twitter name or Facebook profile</b>. We may
also collect Personal Data, such as demographic information from you via the Products
or at other points in our website that state that Personal Data is being collected.
<br><br>

<b>Personal Data Collected via Technology.</b> To make our Site, products, and related services
more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider)
collect Personal Data from you, including <b>your IP address or HTTP referrer</b>. We
also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource
Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the
solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed. Like most
Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each

time you visit our website or access your account on our network. "<b>Cookies</b>" are small
pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are
viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close
your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete
them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website.
Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If
you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly.

<br><br>

<b>Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites.</b> We have created, and may offer You,
interfaces that allow You to connect with social networking websites such as Facebook
and Twitter ("SN Sites") through our Site. We will work with the SN Site's application
protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows You
to authorize us to access Your account on that SN Site on Your behalf. In order to
provide this authorization, You will not provide us with Your user name or password
to the SN Site, but You will need to log-in to that SN Site directly through our Site.
Once authorized by You, the SN Site will provide us a token that allows the SN Site to
recognize us when we ask, on Your behalf, for access to Your account information or
to post information. You will be able to revoke our access to any SN Site at any time by
amending the appropriate settings from within Your account settings on the applicable
SN Site, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide You.

<br><br>

<b>5. USE OF YOUR DATA.</b>

our website in order to improve the products and services we provide.

<br><br>
