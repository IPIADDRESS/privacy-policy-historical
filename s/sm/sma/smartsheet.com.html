    <p><strong>Smartsheet.com Privacy Statement</strong></p><p>Last Updated: July 8, 2008</p><p>Smartsheet.com has created this privacy statement (“Statement”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the Smartsheet.com Web site (the “Site”) is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement at any time. If Smartsheet.com does so, the revised privacy statement will be posted on this Site and you will have the opportunity to modify your opt out elections see Opt-Out Policy below.</p><p>Collected Information and Use: We collect information from you in two ways:</p><ul><li>(1) when you voluntarily submit information to us through various pages of this Site; and</li><li>(2) through the operation of the Site technology.</li></ul><p>When we collect information by means of you voluntarily submitting it to us, we will notify you as to why we are asking for it and how it will be used. Set out in this statement are some of the circumstances when we might collect personal data and what it may be used for.</p><p>We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the “Service”) to give us contact information, such as their name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number.</p><p>Smartsheet.com uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Service that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, by following the opt out instructions located in the e-mails we may send you, or at any time by <a href="/contact">contacting us</a>.</p><p>Separately, customers are also asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service. We may also email information regarding updates to the Service or company. Again, email will not be distributed or shared and customers can opt out of receiving any communication by following the opt out instructions located in the e-mails we may send you or by <a href="/contact">contacting us</a>; provided, however, that Smartsheet.com reserves the right to send its existing customers certain communications relating to the Service as part of our commercial relationship with you, such as service announcements and administrative messages without offering the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</p><p>Smartsheet.com may also collect certain information from visitors to and customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses, hardware profiles, and browser software versions. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p><p><strong>Cookies:</strong><br>When you interact with the Site we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Site, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to identify the customers and visitors of the Site to the Smartsheet.com Web servers.</p><p>Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Smartsheet.com, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a trial, you remain anonymous to Smartsheet.com. Cookies generally operate in two forms: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.</p><p>Smartsheet.com uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information allows Smartsheet.com to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the Smartsheet.com application. Smartsheet.com uses persistent cookies that only Smartsheet.com can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a Smartsheet.com customer or prior visitor to the Site (whatever the case may be). We are careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.</p><p>Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site but will not be able to successfully use our Service.</p><p><strong>Sharing of the Information:</strong><br>Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for in the Smartsheet.com Master Subscription Agreement or as provided herein, we do not disclose to third parties the information provided. All financial and billing information that we collect through the Site is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. This billing information is not used by Smartsheet.com for marketing or promotional purposes.</p><p>Smartsheet.com uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the Site but they are not permitted to collect any information nor does Smartsheet.com share user information with these parties.</p><p>Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information (“Data”). Smartsheet.com will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the Smartsheet.com Master Subscription Agreement or as provided herein, or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Master Subscription Agreement, or as may be required by law. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.</p><p><strong>Third-Party Sites:</strong><br>The Site contains links to other Web sites. Smartsheet.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other Web sites. Customers and visitors will need to check the policy statement of these other Web sites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private and confidential.</p><p><strong>Security:</strong><br>Our Site has appropriate security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. Our Site is accessible only through browsers capable of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. This technology protects data passed between the Site and the browser using both server authentication and encryption to ensure that Data is safe, secure, and available only to you. Smartsheet.com also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, Smartsheet.com provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.</p><p><strong>Opt-Out Policy:</strong><br>Smartsheet.com offers its visitors and customers a means to choose how we may use information provided. If, at any time after registering for information or ordering the Service, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about sharing your information with third parties, send us a request specifying your new choice. Simply <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p><p><strong>Correcting &amp; Updating Your Information:</strong><br>If customers need to update or change registration information they may do so by editing their account settings. To update your account settings, log on to Smartsheet.com and click on My Account. To discontinue the Service, contact us or call +1 425.283.1870. Smartsheet.com will respond to your correction or update request within at most 30 days from the date of your request.</p><p><strong>Acceptance:</strong><br>This privacy statement is incorporated into and subject to the terms and conditions of the Smartsheet.com Master Services Agreement. Use of the Service is subject to your compliance with those terms and conditions, which constitute a legal agreement between you and Smartsheet.com. Each time you use the Service you signify that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by the Master Subscription Agreement, which incorporates this privacy statement.

If you do not agree with the terms of either of such documents, please do not provide Smartsheet.com with any information and do not use this Site.
