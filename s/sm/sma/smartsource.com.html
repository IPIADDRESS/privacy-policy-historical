          the types of other companies that may want to send you information about 
          their products and services and therefore want to share your PII (See 
          "Use" below). However, at the time your PII is collected, SmartSource 
          will notify you of your options regarding our use of your personally 
          identifiable information, including whether we can share it with outside 
          companies (See "Choice" below). Sometimes we collect personally identifiable 
          information from consumers in manual format, such as a post card or 
          subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often 
          proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short

          other relevant information from us. <br>

          The SmartSource web site may be linked to Internet sites operated by 
          other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with 
          a SmartSource logo, even though they are not operated or maintained 
          by SmartSource (for example, sites operated by newspapers or retailers 
          that have a business relationship with SmartSource). The SmartSource 
          web site may also carry advertisements from other companies as well 
          as advertisements placed by national Internet ad agencies. Although 
          we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, SmartSource 
          is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by 
          third parties that are linked to our site, of third party or so-called 
          national advertisers, or third party ad servers. Once you've left the 
          SmartSource site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, 
          you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or 
          advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect 
          from you. <br>
          <br>
          The SmartSource web site may also be linked to sites operated by companies 
          affiliated with SmartSource. Visitors to those affiliated sites should 
          still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which 
          may differ in some respects from this Policy. </font></p>
