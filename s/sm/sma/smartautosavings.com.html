<p>Effective Date:  January 6, 2014</p>

<p><strong>About SmartAutoSavings</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to SmartAutoSavings.com (the "Site"). Because your privacy is important to us, we provide this statement to explain the Site's online information practices. This privacy statement covers the website smartautosavings.com and applies to all information about you collected through the Site.  We built this Site to connect consumers like you with auto dealers and other third parties ("Vendors") who can respond to your requests for information about automobiles and related services.  To enable this functionality, we allow you to provide us with information about yourself that we pass on to those Vendors. We may use information we learn about you to present you with other offers, improve the Site and other uses we describe in this statement. We encourage you to carefully read this privacy statement so you know how we use the information that we collect through the Site.  By using the Site, you agree to our use of your information consistent with this statement.</p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect and How We Use it</strong></p>

<p>When you fill out a form on the Site to contact Vendors or communicate with us (a "Request"), we collect all of the information in your Request, which may include your name, address, email, phone number and other personal information.  Information contained in a Request may be used or disclosed in the following ways:</p>

<ol>

YOU MAY ALSO RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST ON THIS SITE, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.  Vendors or others to whom we provide your information may also use the information in your Request to market other products or services to you or in other ways in accordance with their own privacy guidelines.  Note that the way Vendors, auto manufacturers, or other third party to which we forward your Request use your information is not under our control and is subject to the privacy policies of those parties.</li>
	
	<li>We may use the information contained in your Request to contact you, including via email, with marketing offers that may be of interest to you from this Site or others.  We may also contact you to thank you for your Request, conduct satisfaction surveys or other administrative purposes.</li>
	
	<li>We may use the information contained in your Request for our internal purposes unrelated to any transaction, such as to help improve the Site, better understand our customers' needs or to develop new offerings in which you may be interested.</li>
	
	<li>We may provide your information to our affiliates or to other third parties to contact you, including via email, with marketing offers, to use in connection with their marketing and advertising activities, or to use for their internal business purposes such as statistical analysis and reporting.</li>
	
	<li>We (or the Vendors that have received your information) may share or use your information  in response to or to comply with with legal orders and government requests, as needed to support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions, to combat fraud or criminal activity, and to protect our rights or those of our affiliates.</li>
	
	<li>We may combine the information in your Request with other information, including personal information about you from other sources.  We may do this for a number of reasons, including improving the quality of your Request, matching you with the best Vendor, customizing the Site or offers to you, or for internal analysis and research purposes.</li>

</ol>

<p>When you make a Request, you expressly consent to such disclosure and use of the information you submit, including your personally identifiable information.  If you do not want your personally identifiable information shared as described above, then you should not submit a Request - once your Request has been submitted, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of your information in connection with that Request.</p>

<p><u>Information We Collect Without Action By You</u></p>

<p>In addition to the information about you contained in your Request, there is information we learn about you through your interaction with the Site or other websites, advertisements and emails.

The information we collect without any action by you includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cookies.  Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser.

	<li>Web beacons.  Web beacons (also called pixel tags or clear gifs) are electronic images, tags or scripts that allow a website to access cookies and help track general usage patterns of visitors to a website.  Web beacons can recognize certain types of information, such as cookies, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.  We use web beacons on this Site as well as other websites and in emails we send and advertisements we present to you.

</ul>

<ol>
	<li>We may use the information to tailor the advertising we deliver to you.  For example, we may use cookie and web beacon information to identify you when you are visiting another site and therefore display advertisements to you.</li>

Once shared with the third party, the use of automatically collected information by the third party is governed by their privacy practices and is outside the scope of this privacy statement.</li>
