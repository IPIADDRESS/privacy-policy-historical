		  <p align="center"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
		</h1>
		<p>This Website Privacy Policy (this "Policy")  applies with respect to the information that we collect from the SmartSuggestor.com's (the "Company") Websites, located at <a href="http://smartsuggestor.com/">SmartSuggestor.com</a>, and explains how we collect, use and disclose your  personal information in connection with our services.&nbsp; Amendments to this  Policy will be posted at this URL.&nbsp; Your continued use of this site  following the posting of any amendment, modification or change shall constitute  your acceptance thereof.&nbsp; While the Company may update you of any changes  to its Privacy Policy, it is your obligation to review the terms of this  Privacy Policy and stay current therewith.<br>
		  <br>
		  <strong>I. INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong><br>
  <br>
		  We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of  ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address, computer  settings or most-recently visited URL.&nbsp; Personally identifiable  information is personal information about you including your name, address,  e-mail address, or phone number, and that which is not otherwise publicly  available. We may also ask you to provide certain non-personally identifiable  information about yourself, such as your age, household income, buying  preferences, etc.&nbsp; Personally identifiable information about you is  collected when you voluntarily submit such information to us, by, for example,  filling out a survey or registration form. We may combine personal information  collected from you with information from other Company services or third  parties to provide a better user experience, including customizing content for  you.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
		  <strong>II. USE OF INFORMATION</strong><br>
  <br>
		  In general, we will only use the information you provide to us for purposes we  deem appropriate.&nbsp; We may use your information (ourselves or utilizing  third-party companies) to deliver you information about our company and  promotional material from some of our partners and affiliates, trend analysis,  pattern detection, and site administration.&nbsp; Your information may also be  used to contact you when necessary and may be shared with or sold to other  companies that may want to contact you with offers that we (or they) believe  are consistent with your preferences.&nbsp; Users may opt-out of receiving  future mailings from Company and other entities by following the instructions  set forth in the opt-out section below.<br>
		  Non-personal demographic and profile data is used to tailor your experience at  our site, showing you content we think you might be interested in.&nbsp; This  information may also be shared with advertisers on an aggregate non-personal  basis. We may also share information with third parties in limited  circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or  imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.<br>
		  The Company may also disclose your information upon a transfer or sale to  another entity of the Company or upon any other corporate reorganization.<br>
  <br>
		  <strong>III. USE OF IP ADDRESSES</strong><br>
  <br>
		  We use your IP Address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to  administer our Website.<br>
  <br>
		  <strong>IV. USE OF COOKIES</strong><br>
  <br>
		  Cookies are an industry standard used by most major Websites.&nbsp; When you  view our Website we might store some information on your computer.&nbsp; This  information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file.&nbsp;  Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our  site.&nbsp; Cookies do not spy on you or otherwise invade your privacy, and  they cannot invade your hard drive and steal information.&nbsp; Rather, they  help you navigate a Website as easily as possible.&nbsp; We use cookies to improve  the quality of our services, deliver content specific to your interests and to  prevent you from reentering all your registration data at each connection.<br>
  <br>
		  We may use an outside advertisement server company to display ads on our  site.&nbsp; These ads may contain cookies.&nbsp; Through banner ads the  advertisement server company may set and access their cookies on your  computer.&nbsp; We do not have access to information that would confirm the use  of cookies by the advertisement server company.&nbsp; Other companies' use of  their cookies is subject to their own privacy policy, not this one. You may  decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies in your  browser, although some of our features may not function properly as a result.<br>
  <br>
		  <strong>V. SECURITY</strong><br>
  <br>
		  Our site has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss,  misuse and alteration of the information under our control.&nbsp; While there  is no such thing as "absolute security" on the Internet, we make good  faith efforts to take every step to ensure the safety of your personal  information, whenever reasonably possible.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
		  <strong>VI. OTHER WEBSITES; LINKS</strong><br>
  <br>
		  Our Website contains links to other Websites.&nbsp; Because this Policy only  applies to the Company Website itself and not linked Websites, you should  examine the privacy policy of any other Websites that you access from the  Company Website. The Company is not responsible for the privacy practices or  the content of such other Websites.<br>
  <br>
