		<h1>Privacy</h1>
		<hr>
<p class="statement">Your privacy is critically important to us. We have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
<li>In all of our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical Graph Corporation ("<strong>Physical Graph</strong>") operates several websites including <a href="http://smartthings.com">smartthings.com</a> and <a href="http://physicalgraph.com">physicalgraph.com</a>. It is Physical Graph's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Physical Graph collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Physical Graph’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Physical Graph’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Physical Graph may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Physical Graph also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Physical Graph or SmartThings blogs. Physical Graph only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Physical Graph's websites choose to interact with Physical Graph in ways that require Physical Graph to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Physical Graph gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, a visitor signing up for an account may provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Physical Graph – by purchasing access to SmartThings products and services, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Physical Graph collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Physical Graph. Physical Graph does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Physical Graph may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Physical Graph may monitor the most popular blogs on the WordPress.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. Physical Graph may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Physical Graph does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Physical Graph discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Physical Graph's behalf or to provide services available at Physical Graph's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Physical Graph's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Physical Graph will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Physical Graph discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Physical Graph believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Physical Graph, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Physical Graph website and have supplied your email address, Physical Graph may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Physical Graph and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Physical Graph takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Physical Graph uses cookies to help Physical Graph identify and track visitors, their usage of Physical Graph website, and their website access preferences. Physical Graph visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Physical Graph's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Physical Graph's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If Physical Graph, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Physical Graph goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Physical Graph may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Physical Graph and does not cover the use of cookies by any other advertisers. In addition:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Third party vendors, including Google, show Physical Graph ads on sites on the internet.</li>
		<li>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve Physical Graph ads based on a user’s prior visit to Physical Graph  websites.</li>
		<li>Users may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.google.com');">Google advertising opt-out page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Physical Graph may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Physical Graph's sole discretion. Physical Graph encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
