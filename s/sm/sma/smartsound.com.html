<p>Information Collection and Use</p>
</font></b><font size="3"> 
<p>Sonic Desktop Software, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected 
  on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in 
  ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Sonic Desktop Software, 
  Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our 
  website.</p>
<b>
<p>Demonstration CD Requests</p>
</b>
<p>In order for us to ship a demonstration CD of our software products, a user 
  is required to give contact information (such as name, address and email address). 
  This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site 
  for which they have expressed interest. Incomplete or false information provided 
  will result in us rejecting the request.</p>
<b>
<p>Order</p>
</b>
<p>We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide 
  contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information 
  (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing 
  purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an 
  order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.</p>
<b>
<p>Log Files</p>
</b>
<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s 
  movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses 
  are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<b>
<p>Sharing</p>
</b> 
<p>We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. 
  This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information 
  for any secondary purposes.<b></b></p>
<b> 
<p>Links</p>
</b> 
<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Sonic 
  Desktop Software, Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such 
  other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and 
  to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally 
  identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information 
  collected by this Web site.</p>
<b> 
<p>Email lists</p>
</b> 
<p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our email list, we ask for contact information 
  such as name and email address. We do not share this information with any other 
  company, and have no plans to do so.</p>
<b> 
<p>Security</p>
</b> 
<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. 
  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is 
  protected both online and off-line.</p>
<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information 
  (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information 
  is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry 
  - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the 
  bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer 
  becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. 
</p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also 
  do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our 
  users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, 
  is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform 
  a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) 
  are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are 
  kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers 
  that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an 
  email to webmaster@sonicdesktop.com.</p>
</font><b><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3"> </font></b><b><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3"> 
<p>Software Updates</p>
</font></b><font size="3"> 
<p>We send periodic email updates to our customers to let them know about new 
  software releases, specials, updates, and other information. Members are able 
  to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information 
  about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services 
  and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.</p>
<b> 
<p>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</p>
</b> 
<p>If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your 
  zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide 
  a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to 
  us. This can be done by calling our sales department at 800-454-1900 or emailing 
  our Customer Service department at sales@sonicdesktop.com<b>.</b> <b> </b></p>
<b> 
<p>Notification of Changes</p>
</b> 
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our 
  Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we 
  use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we 
  decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from 
  that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an 
  email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information 
  in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy 
  policy under which the information was collected. </p>
