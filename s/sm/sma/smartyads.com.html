			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") covers BuySellAds.com Inc.'s ("BSA's") treatment of personally identifiable information collected from your use of BuySellAds.com (the"Site") and is part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our Terms (BuySellAds.com/about/terms).

By using the Site, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.</p>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us, and our policy is simple: we will collect no personally identifiable information about you when you visit the Site unless you choose to provide that information (as explained further below). This Privacy Policy does not describe information collection practices on other sites, including those linked to or from the Site.</p>
            <p>BSA may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a revised Privacy Policy on the Site, and/or sending information regarding the amendment to the email address you provide to BSA.

            <h4 class="color-5">Normal Site Usage:</h4>
            <p>You can visit many portions of the Site without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. Information we may collect from such a Site visit is the default information customarily logged by web server software, which may include the date and time of your visit, the originating IP address, and the pages and images requested. We may use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the Site to our visitors and Account holders.</p>
            <h4 class="color-5">Collection and Use of Personal Information:</h4>
