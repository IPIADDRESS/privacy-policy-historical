        Traffic or Clickstream Data.</font></i></b><font style="font-size: 12px" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" color="#605f5f"> 
        Data about traffic and usage is not personally identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. Mezi Media may share information it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. For example, we may tell an advertiser that a certain number of people visited a certain area on our Web site, or searched our site for a specific product. Mezi Media collects some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) users access. For example, Mezi Media's servers collect information about the site to which you may depart to enable Mezi Media to calculate and receive payments from its partners. In addition, Mezi Media uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design the Services.<o:p> </o:p><br>

These cookies contain identification information that enables us to see how our users are interacting with our site and how frequently they are returning, as well as to streamline their experiences using the Services. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. Cookies lets us know about repeat visitors and if we are delivering quality products and services. Mezi Media may also use cookies to identify which sites our repeat visitors are coming from, so that we can place more of our online advertising on these sites, and can, where necessary, pay our business partners. To Mezi Media, using information within cookies is an anonymous way to survey how we are doing and to look for ways to improve our Services. You may set your browser software to reject cookies, but you may not be able to use all of the features of the Services. Mezi Media may share information about usage of the Services with third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.<o:p> </o:p><br>

        To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, Mezi Media has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects online. However, data security is a constantly evolving art and science. You should consider any communication that you transmit to Mezi Media (such as data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and agree that Mezi Media will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient.
