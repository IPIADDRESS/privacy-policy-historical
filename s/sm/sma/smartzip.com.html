      <p></p><p><em>Last Updated on September 9, 2013</em></p>

<p><strong>Our Commitment to Privacy</strong></p>

<p>We take your privacy seriously. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. These privacy practices apply to the Website located at <a href="http://www.smartzip.com">www.smartzip.com</a> and related SmartZip websites, pages, Facebook applications, and/or mobile applications (collectively, the "Site") that you were viewing when you clicked through to this policy, which is operated directly by us, by our partner, or by our affiliate.</p>

<p>The Site has been established as a resource for users to educate themselves about real estate investing, search for real estate investment properties across the United States, utilize tools to score, rate and/or rank properties, register to utilize additional tools and to receive email notifications and/or newsletters, and submit information to be distributed to third-party realtors across the country.</p>

<p><strong>User Consent</strong></p>

<p>By submitting personal information through our Site, products, or related services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your personal information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>

<p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>

<p>You can browse our Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.</p>

<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services. Several of the services and features that we offer on our Sites require you to provide us with information as a condition of usage. These include access to registered or member-only areas, the ability to post opinions or other content, participation in contests, receive email alerts and participation in message boards. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States. We may collect and store the following personal information:</p>

<ul><li>Personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, mobile number and credit card information when you provide it to us;</li><li>Sensitive information, such as your job title, gender, username and password;</li><li>Transactional information based on your activities on the Site (such as searching, sorting, purchasing, item and content you generate or that relates to your account);</li><li>Shipping, billing and other information you provide to purchase or ship an item;</li><li>Community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through our Sites, and correspondence sent to us;</li><li>Other information from your interaction with our Sites, services, content and advertising, including computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Sites, ad data, IP address and standard web log information;</li><li>Information from other companies, such as demographic and navigation data; and</li><li>Feedback and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume or additional profile information if you chose to participate in one of our surveys.</li></ul>

<p>We may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you provided to us. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us.</p>

<p><strong>How Do We Handle Cookies?</strong></p>

<p>Your Internet browser has a feature called cookies, which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our Sites. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit most of our Sites, although active participation in certain areas of our Sites may require cookies. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information, in which case we use the information to enhance your services in the ways described below. By adjusting your settings on your browser, you may elect not to allow cookies to be collected.</p>

<p>We also use technologies, including electronic images known as Web bugs-sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or beacons-that allow us to track general user-traffic patterns. We also automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our Site, and information about pages you visited. Unless you have registered for one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you.</p>

<p>We use cookies and tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including:</p>

<ul><li>Keeping count of return visits to our Site or our advertisers' or partners' sites;</li><li>Accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on the Site and advertisement usage;</li><li>Determining which features our overall user population likes best;</li><li>Saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site; and</li><li>Displaying the most appropriate advertising or content based on your interests.</li></ul>

<p>We allow other companies that are presenting advertisements on our Site and, sometimes, in our newsletters and email alerts to use tracking technology on your computer. We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Unless you visit the site of these companies and provide them with personally identifiable information about yourself, these tracking technologies do not provide those advertisers with personally identifiable information. Our advertisers' use of tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>

<p><strong>How Do We Use the Information?</strong></p>

<p>We use the information we gather for four general purposes:</p>

<ul><li>To customize the advertising and the content you see;</li><li>To enhance the user experience in our network of Sites. We use tracking information to determine how well each page performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages. This helps us continue to build a better service for you;</li><li>To fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling you to participate in paid services, polls, contests, and message boards;</li><li>To send you information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you; and</li></ul>

<p><strong>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

<p>We will make your personally identifiable information available to other companies or people when:</p>
