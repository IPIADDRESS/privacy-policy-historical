<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h5>Our  Commitment to Privacy</h5>
<p>We take your privacy  seriously. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we  want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection  and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types of  information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. These  privacy practices apply to the Web site that you were viewing when you clicked  through to this policy, which is operated directly by us, by our partner, or by  our affiliate.</p>
<p>This Web site has been  established as a resource for users to educate themselves about real estate  investing, search for real estate investment properties across the United  States, utilize tools to score, rate and/or rank properties, register to  utilize additional tools and to receive email notifications and/or newsletters,  and submit information to be distributed to third-party realtors across the  country.</p>
<h5>User  Consent</h5>
<p>By submitting personal  information through our Web site, products, or related services, you agree to  the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of  your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Your personal information may be processed in  the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the  United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be  less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>
<h5>What  Information Do We Collect?</h5>
<p>You can browse our site  without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about  yourself. </p>
<p>Our primary goal in  collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful  content and services. Several of the services and features that we offer on our  sites require you to provide us with information as a condition of usage. These  include access to registered or member-only areas, the ability to post opinions  or other content, participation in contests, receive email alerts and  participation in message boards. If you choose to provide us with personal  information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our  servers located in the United States. We  may collect and store the following personal information: </p>
<ul>
<li>Personally  identifiable information, such as your name, email address, postal address,  phone number, mobile number and credit card information when you provide it to  us; </li>
<li>Sensitive  information, such as your job title, gender, username and password; </li>
<li>Transactional  information based on your activities on the site (such as searching, sorting,  purchasing, item and content you generate or that relates to your account); </li>
<li>Shipping,  billing and other information you provide to purchase or ship an item; </li>
<li>Community  discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through our  sites,&nbsp;and correspondence sent to us;</li>
<li>Other  information from your interaction with our sites, services, content and  advertising, including computer and connection information, statistics on page  views, traffic to and from the sites, ad data, IP address and standard web log  information; </li>
<li>Information  from other companies, such as demographic and navigation data; and</li>
<li>Feedback  and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume or additional  profile information if you chose to participate in one of our surveys.</li>
</ul>
<p>We  may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the  information you provided to us.&nbsp; Once you  give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us.</p>
<h5>How Do We Handle Cookies?</h5>
<p>Your  Internet browser has a feature called cookies, which stores small amounts of  data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites. You do not need to  have cookies turned on to visit most of our sites, although active  participation in certain areas of our sites may require cookies. Cookies alone  tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally  identifiable information, in which case we use the information to enhance your  services in the ways described below. By adjusting your settings on your  browser, you may elect not to allow cookies to be collected. </p>
<p>We also use technologies, including electronic images  known as Web bugs-sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or  beacons-that allow us to track general user-traffic patterns. We also  automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your  browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our  site, and information about pages you visited. Unless you have registered for  one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of  tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable  information about you. </p>
<p>We use cookies and tracking technologies in a variety of  ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping  count of return visits to our site or our advertisers’ or partners’ sites; </li>
<li>Accumulating  and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical  information on Web site and advertisement usage; </li>
<li>Determining  which features our overall user population likes best; </li>
<li>Saving  your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site;  and</li>
<li>Displaying  the most appropriate advertising or content based on your interests. </li>
</ul>
<p>We allow other companies that are presenting  advertisements on our site and, sometimes, in our newsletters and email alerts  to use tracking technology on your computer. We do not give any personally  identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Unless you visit  the Web site of these companies and provide them with personally identifiable  information about yourself, these tracking technologies do not provide those  advertisers with personally identifiable information. Our advertisers’ use of  tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
<h5>How  Do We Use the Information?</h5>
<p>We use the information we gather for four general  purposes: </p>
<ul>
<li>To  customize the advertising and the content you see; </li>
<li>To  enhance the user experience in our network of sites. We use tracking information  to determine how well each page performs overall based on aggregate user  demographics and traffic patterns to those pages. This helps us continue to  build a better service for you; </li>
<li>To  fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out  electronic newsletters and enabling you to participate in paid services, polls,  contests, and message boards; </li>
<li>To  send you information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of  interest to you; and</li>
</ul>
<h5>Disclosure  of Personally Identifiable Information </h5>
<p>We will make your personally identifiable information  available to other companies or people when: </p>
<ul>
<li>You  have elected to allow us to share that information at the time that you  registered with us or provided us the information, or through a subsequent  affirmative election through our Web site; </li>
<li>You  volunteer information or create a public profile in the course of your  participation in our community features such as forums, user opinions and  reviews, chat rooms, photo sharing or other forms of public communication and  interaction; </li>
<li>You  use cobranded services (i.e., sites or services that we offer to you in  connection with a partner, who is identified on the site) within our site and  grant us permission to pass your registration information back to that service  partner (their use of your information is subject to their applicable privacy  policies); </li>
<li>We  hire third-party vendors to provide specialized services, such as customer  support, email message deployment, suppression, merge and de-duplication  services, data processing, and special products or services that you have  requested (these companies are only allowed to use the information in order to  help us fulfill our services to you and we do not provide your information to  these companies for their own, permanent use); </li>
<li>You  unsubscribe for a mailing that we send to you on behalf of a third party; we  may share your removal instruction with the third party so that it may be added  to that person’s list of people to whom they may not send emails; </li>
<li>You  are the winner of a contest or a sweepstakes that is co-sponsored with a third  party and that third party needs your information in order to manage the prize  fulfillment process; </li>
<li>When  required by law, such as when we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal  process; </li>
<li>We  believe that your actions violate applicable laws, SmartZip’s Terms of Service, or  any usage guidelines for specific products or services, or threaten the rights,  property, or safety of our company, our users, or others; </li>
<li>Members of the SmartZip corporate family – to provide joint content and  services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect  and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to  guide decisions about their products, services and communications; members of  our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing  communications only if you’ve requested their services; and</li>
<li>We use return email  addresses to answer the email we receive; such addresses are not used for any  other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. </li>
</ul>
<h5>Aggregate  information </h5>
<p>We aggregate personally identifiable information and  disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to  advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, and other  purposes. We do not disclose to these entities any information that could be  used to identify you personally. </p>
<h5>Feedback</h5>
<p>If you provide feedback on  any of our products or related services, we may use such feedback for any  purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your personally  identifiable information.&nbsp; Company will  collect any information contained in such communication and will treat the  personally identifiable information in such communication in accordance with  this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p></p>
<h5>Business  transfers </h5>
<p>We are always seeking to improve our network of Web sites  and our business. In accomplishing these objectives, we may buy or sell a  company, or one or more of the companies in our corporate family may merge with  or be acquired by another company. If we sell a business, we may transfer some  or all of your information as a part of the sale in order that the service  being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes. </p>
<h5>What Is Not Covered</h5>
<p>The SmartZip privacy policy does not extend  to the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>You  may request to speak with a third-party Realtor regarding a listed property.  With your initiated approval, SmartZip collects your submitted information, and  forwards your name, phone and email to that Realtor. At this point, the  SmartZip privacy policy does not extend to that independent Realtor. You will  need to contact them to understand their privacy policies and how your contact  information will be used beyond the initiated conversation.</li>
<li>At  times, you may be directed to third-party Web sites. Our provision of a link to  any other Web site is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement  of such other Website or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will  leave our site and go to another site.&nbsp;  During this process, a third party may collect personally identifiable  information from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be  responsible for, these outside Web sites or their content.&nbsp; Please be aware that the terms of this  Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside Web sites or content, or to any  collection of data after you click on a link to a third party. You will need to  contact them to understand their privacy policies.</li>
</ul>
<h5>What Are my Options?</h5>
<p>Users  who would rather not provide any of the user data requested by our registration  process do not need to register with us. You can still view much of the content  and use many of the services offered by our site without registering. </p>
<p>We also give users the following options: </p>
<ul>
<li>Opting  not to receive our electronic newsletters or those of third parties when  registering; users who opt in may remove themselves from mailing lists at any  time through the subscription-management pages or by following the instructions  at the end of the e-mail they received from us; and</li>
<li>Opting  not to provide certain personal information when registering for a site;  provided, however, that you may not be able to use some of our products or  services without providing us with certain information. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can review, correct, or change the  information collected during registration for any of our sites. The  instructions for doing this can be found in our member-services areas. Users  may change information at any time and as often as necessary. Users who are  experiencing problems with our services or who have questions about how our  services work can contact <a href="mailto:services@smartzip.com?subject=Service%20Request">Customer Service</a>. </p>
<h5>How  is My Information Protected?</h5>
<p>Your password is the key to your account. Use unique  numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your SmartZip  password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information  with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the  name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose  substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to  legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has  been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. </p>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data  accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place  appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and  secure the information we collect online. </p>
<h5>A Note About Children </h5>
<p>We do not intentionally  gather personal information about users who are under the age of 13.</p>
<h5>How Will I Know if the Privacy Policy is Changed?</h5>
<p>Any modifications to our privacy practices  will be reflected first within this area of our Web site.
