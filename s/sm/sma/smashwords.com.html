<h1>Privacy Statement for Smashwords, Inc.</h1> <p>Smashwords has created this privacy statement to explain our commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site. <br><br><strong>Our 100% privacy promise to you: </strong> Smashwords is committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors and members.  We will never sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone.  You always control your communications preferences.<br><br><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THIS SITE:</strong><br>For all web site visitors, we collect your IP addresses, browser type, page views, clickstream and usage.  This information helps us continually optimize the performance and usability of the site; display content and advertising that matches visitor or member interests; and make automated book recommendations.  <br><strong><br>Non-member Activity</strong> - It is not necessary to become a registered member to enjoy some of the content on Smashwords, although without membership your viewing options and community participation may be limited.  For example, without membership you will not be able to purchase books, post reviews, publish material on the site, receive payments for your work, create profile pages, or track your favorite authors.<br><br><strong>Smashwords Member Activity </strong>- Smashwords members are allowed to access all public areas of the site.  We store cookies in your browser to help you personalize your use of the site and so you are automatically logged in to the site each time you visit (unless you manually logged out during your last visit).  Members can post reviews, purchase books, publish books, and take advantage of the site’s complementary book marketing tools.  When you register for the site, our registration form requires a valid email address so we can contact you about your account and respond to your customer service requests.  We ask you to create a unique Smashwords password so we can protect access to your account.  We ask for demographic information like zip code and whether you are over or under 18 years of age. We use your zip code to present you with geographically relevant information, and we use age to prevent children from viewing inappropriate adult content.  We record several details related to your usage of the site such as reviews you’ve posted, books you’ve published, books you’ve sold, author pages you’ve browsed, books you’ve sampled or purchased, commissions you’ve earned, and books and authors you have favorited.  We do not disclose your personally identifiable member information or usage to third parties.  However, any information you voluntarily upload or post to the site, such as books, book reviews or personal profile information, becomes publicly available to other users of the site.  When you create a personal profile page, your email address is shielded from visitors.  <br><br>Smashwords allows member authors to publish their works under assumed “pen names.”  Under no circumstances will Smashwords reveal the author’s true identity to customers or site visitors.<br><br>Authors who wish to sell their works on Smashwords are required to provide more detailed registration information, such as real name, a postal mailing address, a phone number, and possibly tax ID information to comply with State and local tax codes.  Smashwords will only use this contact information to fulfill our obligations to you, and will not sell or rent your information to third parties.<br><br><strong>Smashwords Email Policy:</strong><br>Registered members will receive occasional emails from Smashwords summarizing site news and feature updates. Smashwords authors/publishers will receive email alerts when they sell a book, or when their book is reviewed, or when Smashwords sends out exclusive Author/Publisher alerts.&nbsp;  After you purchase a book, we may send you an email reminder to review it.  We may add additional event triggers in the future. Members may opt-out of these updates, or subscribe to other updates, at any time by adjusting their communications preferences at <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/account/comm">https://www.smashwords.com/account/comm</a>.  Smashwords does not allow third parties to send emails to its members unless the member explicity provides their permission (see "Sharing Email Address with Authors..., below). Member email addresses are never revealed on the web site.  Smashwords prohibits its author members from engaging in spam email to promote their books.  See the Smashwords <a href="tos">Terms of Service</a> for more information.</p> <p><strong>Sharing Email Address with Authors/Publishers In Exchange for Free Books or Discounts</strong><strong></strong><strong>:</strong><br>Some Smashwords authors may offer special discounts, or even free ebooks to customers in exchange for the customer agreeing to provide their email address to the author.  In cases where such incentives are offered, Smashwords will clearly notify the customer in advance, and give the customer the option to accept the incentive, or reject the incentive and proceed with a purchase at the regular price.  Under no circumstances will the customer's email address be shared with the author or publisher unless the customer clearly confirms their acceptance of the offer by clicking an "I AGREE" button.<br><br><strong>Advertising on the Smashwords Site:</strong><br>Although Smashwords does not currently run advertising, we may run ads in the future. If we run ads, we will do our best to make them unobtrusive, and when possible, informative and targeted to your specific interests.  We will never use pop-up or pop-under ads because we think they’re annoying<br><br><strong>Children's Guidelines</strong><br>Smashwords is not marketed to children.  Like any ordinary bookstore, Smashwords hosts books that may contain adult themes and situations not recommended for children.  We take multiple steps to ensure this content is not presented to children.  First, we ask a member’s age range at registration.  Young adults and children under age 18 are blocked from viewing content that contains adult situations or content deemed to be objectionable to children.  We have three means for identifying potentially objectionable material:  1.  We allow authors to specify if their works are suitable for children.  2.  We allow members to flag works they believe are unsuitable for children.  3.  We warn members of potentially objectionable content before they click through to it.<br><br>Children, should they wish to join, are allowed to become members. The above online information we collect from children is the same we collect from all members, and will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and will not be used by Smashwords for any other purposes without prior parental consent. If Smashwords learns that a child has posted information that would allow others to personally contact the child, Smashwords will immediately remove the information. <br><br><strong>Choice/Opt-Out</strong><br>Smashwords provides users the opportunity to opt-in and opt-out of receiving email communications from Smashwords.
