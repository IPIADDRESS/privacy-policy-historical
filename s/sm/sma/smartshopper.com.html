						acquired, or undergoes a corporate restructuring, the service and all information collected by the service would be

					<p><b>Software updates</b></p>
					<p>The browser add-on is designed to check for the availability of updates to 
						ensure that you enjoy the latest improvements. When the browser add-on checks

						new version is available for download.</p>
