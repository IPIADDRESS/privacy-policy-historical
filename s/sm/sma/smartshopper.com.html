									This Privacy Policy covers the use of the website <a href="http://www.smartshopper.com/">
										www.smartshopper.com</a> and the SmartShopper software and comparative 
									service provided therein (collectively: "SmartShopper"), which are owned by 
									Smartshopper Ltd. To learn more about us, go to <a href="http://www.smartshopper.com/smartshopper/Company">
										http://www.smartshopper.com/smartshopper/Company</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									At SmartShopper, we’re committed to your privacy and your privacy is safe with 
									us. Our Privacy Policy is simple:
								</p>
								<p><b>What do we do?</b></p>
								<p>
									</p><ul class="ul">
										<li>
										When you visit a recognized shopping or travel website, the SmartShopper 
										software connects to our servers to check for product and travel information, 
										better prices and alternative offers for the product or travel service you were 
										interested in, in order to present them to you.
										</li><li>
										The sites on which SmartShopper operates are only sites which we have examined, 
										cataloged and approved as safe for the user, and the software maintains a 
										regularly-updated “white list” of such sites. The software does not track or 
										transmit any data when you visit sites which are not on that "white list".
										</li><li>
										The software transmits to our servers only the URL of the e-commerce or travel 
										site you are visiting or the search term you typed in on these e-commerce or 
										travel sites. In some of the pages our software also transmits data about the 
										products or the travel information presented on the page, in order to provide 
										you with related information and comparative offers.
										</li><li>
											We offer you comparative product and travel deals, as well as additional 
											product and travel information, from the most trusted vendors on the net.</li>
									</ul>
								<p></p>
								<p><b>What we don't do:</b></p>
								<p>
									</p><ul class="ul">
										<li>
										We do not collect any personally identifiable information ("PII") about you.
										</li><li>
										We do not trade, rent or sell PII to third parties. We do not disclose the URLs 
										visited by you to anybody else.
										</li><li>
										We do not transmit to our servers any information about your searches or 
										website visits, except for information about visits to e-commerce and travel 
										sites, and searches performed on such sites. When such information is 
										transmitted to our servers, it is processed only for the purpose of performing 
										the comparative service and nothing else is being done with it.
										</li><li>
											We do not display popups on your computer.</li>
									</ul>
								<p></p>

								</p>
								<p><b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									<u>(a) Anonymous Aggregate Information</u>
								</p><p>
									SmartShopper collects and stores aggregated anonymous information about the 
									e-commerce or travel web pages its users view and the data they enter in search 
									engine search fields while using the SmartShopper software (the “Service”). 
									SmartShopper uses this information to determine which alternative offers and 
									additional product or travel information to display on your browser window 
									pane.
								</p>
								<p>
									The SmartShopper software does not send to our servers any information about 
									the web pages you view unless you are visiting one of the e-commerce or travel 
									sites that we have examined and catalogued. For every such e-commerce or travel 
									web page you view while using the Service, the SmartShopper software transmits 
									from your computer to the SmartShopper server and stores the following 
									information: your Internet Protocol (IP) Address; the Full Uniform Resource 
									Locator (URL) of the web page you are visiting; general information about your 
									browser and your computer's operating system; your SmartShopper cookie number 
									and the date and time the above information is logged. We also collect and 
									store the following SmartShopper usage statistics: what is clicked on the 
									browser window pane; the amount of time the Service is used during each 
									session; which keyword searches are performed within the application search box 
									and what alternative results are received during any given session.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you are only visiting our site (<a href="http://www.smartshopper.com/">www.smartshopper.com</a>), 
									we collect the following information: the URL of the web page from which you 
									came; the date and time of each page you view; the name of and information 
									about any advertisement that brought you to our web site; and computer and 
									connection information. If the URL of the page from which you came contains any 
									PII about you, we will not attempt to determine your identity by analyzing the 
									URL in any way. Also the IP address of the computer from which you arrived to 
									our site is recorded by the web server; this is an automated information 
									collection as done by any web server, and we do not store this information for 
									any type of use.
								</p>
								<p><u>(b) Personally Identifiable Information</u></p>
								<p>
									Currently there is no personal registration on our site. In the future, we may 
									add services that can ask for your registration. In these cases registration 
									will be optional and you may choose to use the SmartShopper program without 
									revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. If you choose 
									to register, the SmartShopper software will ask you for some PII (for example 
									your name, email address, and a city or an airport near you) in order to create 
									an account.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you contact us through the "Partner with us" or "contact us" pages, you are 
									required to provide your e-mail address and, optionally, name and phone number, 
									so that we may be able to respond to your inquiry. In any event, this PII is 
									not used in any manner other than to contact you regarding your inquiry.
								</p>
								<p>
								Any PII which would be gathered, as described above, is stored separately from 
								the information about the web pages you view and the data you enter in search 
								engine search fields and the two types of information are not correlated or 
								linked.
								</p><p>
									Except for the specific cases described above, we do not gather PII from you 
									without your specific permission when you visit the SmartShopper site and 
									download the SmartShopper software or use the Service.
								</p>
								<a name="COOKIES"></a>
								<p><b>COOKIES</b>
								</p><p>
									Upon visiting <a href="http://www.smartshopper.com/">www.smartshopper.com</a>, 
									a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. This 
									cookie assigns your Web browser a unique series of numbers, letters, or 
									characters that enables SmartShopper’s servers to recognize and identify your 
									web browser when you are using the Service and help customize your online 
									experience and make it more convenient for you. The cookie improves the quality 
									of our service by getting a better understanding of how people interact with 
									us. Cookies are also useful in allowing more efficient log-in for users, 
									tracking transaction histories and preserving information between sessions. 
									Cookies are not tied to users' personally identifiable information.
								</p>
								<p><a name="cgifs"></a> <b>Clear gifs</b>
								</p><p>
									We and our third party advertising companies employ a software technology 
									called clear gifs (sometimes called web beacons), that help inform us of what 
									content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier 
									which are used to verify that certain content items have been actually viewed 
									by the user. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personally identifiable 
									information.
								</p>
								<p><b>WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</b></p>
								<p>
									SmartShopper analyzes its logs of usage paths and stored search terms collected 
									from users of the SmartShopper software to build anonymous web usage profiles. 
									If a user provides limited PII either through voluntary registration or through 
									contacting SmartShopper, in such case SmartShopper does not correlate or link 
									such user's anonymous usage profile to any PII such user has provided to 
									SmartShopper. SmartShopper uses these anonymous web usage profiles and stored 
									search terms to determine alternative offers to display.
								</p>
								<p>
									SmartShopper does not:
								</p>
								<p>
									(a) Associate or store non-personally identifiable web usage data or search 
									information with any PII;
									<br>
									(b) Analyze such web usage data or search information to determine the identity 
									of any SmartShopper user; or
									<br>
									(c) Use PII to determine which ads and alternative offers to display on your 
									SmartShopper browser window pane.
								</p>
								<p><b>DO WE SHARE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</b></p>
								<p>
									1. <u>PII</u> - We only share personally identifiable information with third 
									parties under the following circumstances:
								</p>
								<p>
									We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as 
									required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our 
									rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process 
									served on us.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the event that SmartShopper sells substantially all of its assets or is 
									acquired, the Service and all information collected by the Service would be 
									transferred to the acquiring party. In any such transfer, however, such 
									information would remain subject to any terms and conditions applicable to the 
									Service at the time the information was collected, including the terms of this 
									Privacy Policy and any amendment thereto. See "Changes to this Privacy Policy" 
									section.
								</p>
								<p>
									From time to time, we employ other companies and individuals to perform 
									functions on our behalf, such as technical support services. To perform those 
									functions, it may be necessary for them to obtain access to SmartShopper’s 
									databases and servers, which may contain PII about users. They may not use such 
									access or information for any purpose other than that for which such companies 
									and individuals are retained.
								</p>
								<p>
									2. <u>Anonymous Information</u> - SmartShopper works with third party providers 
									to serve comparative offers when you visit our web site and use the Service, 
									including the browser window pane. We may share anonymous web site usage 
									information about the Service, including the browser window pane, with such 
									companies for the purpose of managing and targeting comparative offers and for 
									market research analysis on our web sites and the Service. For these purposes, 
									we and our third party providers may note some of the pages you visit on our 
									web sites, and while using the Service, trough the use of <a href="#cgifs">clear 
										gifs</a>. As indicated above, the cookies and clear gifs are not tied to 
									any PII and we cannot identify your personal information through them. SmartShopper does not place any restrictions on usage of this anonymous information by its third-party partners.
								</p>
								<p><b>AGE REQUIREMENT</b></p>
								<p>You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Software. By accepting the terms 
									of this Agreement and using Software, you represent that you are over the age 
									of 18. If you are under 18 years of age, but are at least 13 years of age or 
									older, your parent or legal guardian must accept the terms of this Agreement on 
									your behalf.</p>
								<p><b>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</b></p>
								<p>
									This website is directed towards and designed for use by persons aged 13 or 
									older. We will not approve applications of, or establish or maintain accounts 
									for, any child whom we know to be under the age of 13. We do not solicit or 
									knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the 
									age of 13. If we nevertheless receive personally identifiable information from 
									an individual who indicates that he or she is, or whom we otherwise have reason 
									to believe is, under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our 
									systems.
								</p>
								<p><b>THIRD PARTY SITES</b></p>
								<p>
									SmartShopper, from time to time, may work with affiliates and/or sponsors to 
									offer users the opportunity to register for services or subscribe to various 
									newsletters or other information services. While we try to link only to 
									websites that we believe share our respect for privacy, please be aware that 
									SmartShopper is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of 
									other websites and we encourage you to read the privacy statements and terms of 
									use of such other third parties before you provide personally identifiable 
									information to them since their privacy policy and terms of use shall apply to 
									such activity.
								</p>
								<p><b>SOFTWARE UPDATES</b>
								</p><p>
									The Software is designed to check for the availability of software updates to 
									ensure that you enjoy the latest improvements to the Software. When the 
									Software checks for the availability of software updates, anonymous information 
									about the Software version and installed components is sent to our web server. 
									The information is used to determine whether new free software is available for 
									download and is not associated with your PII.
								</p>
								<p><b>OPT-OUT / CHOICES/ CHANGES</b>
								</p><p>
									To temporarily snooze, permanently disable or set usage rules for certain parts 
									of the SmartShopper Service, go to the SmartShopper pane in the browser, click 
									"Options", which will open up the Options window, and there select your 
									preferences.
								</p>
								<p>
									This window gives users the option of changing and modifying information 
									previously provided. You may add or modify the provided information by clicking 
									the options button / link on the left pane or the website.
								</p>
								<p>
								</p><p><b>REMOVAL OF THE SMARTSHOPPER SOFTWARE</b></p>
								<p>
									If you are having technical or other difficulty with the SmartShopper 
									comparative shopping application, please contact our support team at <a href="mailto:support@smartshopper.com">
										support@smartshopper.com.</a> To remove the SmartShopper comparative 
									shopping application you will need to uninstall the software using Microsoft's 
									Windows control panel add/remove software function (by removing the entry 
									"smartshopper").
								</p>
								<p><b>INFORMATION SECURITY</b>
								</p><p>
									SmartShopper undertakes reasonable physical, electronic and procedural security 
									measures in order to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the 
									information under our control. We restrict access to the database that contains 
									PII to a limited number of employees who may access that information only for 
									legitimate business or legal purposes. Those employees are instructed and 
									trained to maintain the database while safeguarding the privacy of users. While 
									we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot absolutely guarantee 
									the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products 
									or services.
								</p>
								<p><b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
								<p>
									SmartShopper is constantly evolving. New features are continuously being added 
									to the site and software. With these improvements, our Privacy Policy may 
									evolve. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes 
									to this Privacy Policy on the SmartShopper homepage and website, on the 
									SmartShopper application, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are 
									aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
									circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this 
									Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material 
									changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a 
									notice on our homepage.
								</p>
