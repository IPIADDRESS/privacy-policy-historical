                            <p>We use Web Bugs to help us better manage content on our website by informing us what content is effective. Web Bugs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Web Bugs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence. Web Bugs collect information such as cookie identifiers, IP addresses, times and dates of pages being viewed and the URL of the page on which the Web Bugs appears. The data that we collect is aggregated and anonymised and we do not tie the information gathered by Web Bugs on our website to any personally identifiable information.</p>
                            <p>When we send you emails, we may include a Web Bugs to allow us to determine the number of people who open our emails and information such as when and how many times the email was viewed, whether any links were clicked on and whether the email was forwarded. When you click on a link in an email, we may record this individual response to customise our offerings to you. Web Bugs can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive Web Bugs via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML emails via your email software, but please note that this is likely to reduce the functionality of such emails. </p>
