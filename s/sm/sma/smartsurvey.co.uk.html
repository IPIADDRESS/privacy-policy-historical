        Part 2: Privacy of Survey Respondents
    </h2>
    <p>
        A “Survey Respondent” is anyone who fills out a survey powered by SmartSurvey.
    </p>
    <h3>
        The information SmartSurvey collects about Survey Respondents
    </h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Survey responses:</strong> On the instructions of the Account Holder, we collect your survey responses on their behalf. We then store those survey responses for the Account Holder. If you would like your survey responses erased, rectified, accessed or for any other queries about your responses, please contact the Account Holder directly. Please bear in mind that not all surveys are anonymous and some Account Holders may ask you to put in your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
        Information which the Account Holder has shared with us for the
        purposes of administering the survey:
    </strong> Sometimes Account Holders list their Survey Respondents for us to contact to take the survey, or to ensure that certain data is not duplicated by the same Survey Respondent. Because of this you may find that the Account Holder has shared your email address so that we can contact you about responding to the survey, or has allowed for your IP address to be recorded and linked to your survey responses when you complete the survey responses. Please contact the Account Holder for further help on this issue.
    </p>
    <h3>
        SmartSurvey’s Use of the information we collect about you
    </h3>
    <p>
        We do not use your survey responses other than carrying out the service for the Account Holder. Your survey responses are owned and managed by the Account Holder who will have its own policy on data handling and would decide on whether your survey responses are kept private, disclosed to third parties, or provided to the public.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do however employ a high standard of security, so if the Account Holder keeps your survey responses private, it will be stored in a highly secured environment – for more information please see our security section below and our security policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not sell your survey data to other parties nor do we store it to contact you for a purpose other than under the direction of Account Holder.
    </p>
    <p>
        We only share your data with third parties if necessary to carry out the service(s) that the Account Holder has requested and as mentioned in this Privacy Policy &amp; Notice.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an Account Holder does not select the “Anonymous Survey” feature, then your IP address will be stored along with your responses.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Your rights to the data we process on behalf of the Account Holder
    </h3>
    <p>
        If you want to access your data, rectify your data, erase your data, object to the processing of your data, or for any other enquiries regarding the handling of your data, please contact the Account Holder directly. The Account Holder is able to amend, erase and access all the survey data and responses from its account.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you believe that the Account Holder is not complying with its legal obligation(s) regarding your data, please contact our legal team for a resolution: hah@smartsurvey.co.uk.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can opt out of receiving survey requests by contacting the Account Holder directly. Alternatively you can also click on the link supplied in an invitation email to opt out of receiving survey requests.

    <h2>
        Data Retention
    </h2>
    <p>
        Please note that as the Account Holders control their own survey data, if you are a Survey Respondent to an Account Holder’s survey you will need to contact them directly to amend or delete anything in your survey responses.

This data is anonymised by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months). This data is stored with Google not SmartSurvey.

    </p>
    <p>
        Personal data: any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“ Data Subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third Party: a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Restriction of processing: the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Processing: any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Profiling: any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consent: Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.

        Legal Basis
    </h3>
    <p>

            the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
        </li>
        <li>
            processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
        </li>
        <li>
            processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
        </li>
        <li>
            processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
        </li>
        <li>
            processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; or,
        </li>
        <li>
            processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
