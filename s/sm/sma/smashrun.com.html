                    Through our Service, Smashrun enables You, if You choose, to share information with others,
                    as this is a crucial component of positive social reinforcement. SMASHRUN IS DEDICATED
                    TO PROVIDING YOU WITH FULL CONTROL OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA. Smashrun's default settings for 
                    new users are set to PUBLIC, which allows anyone to see your âRun Overviewâ pages, âRanks,â 
                    âBadges,â and your âInviteâ page. However, You can always opt to maintain as PRIVATE your 
                    Smashrun user profile within your settings. We encourage You to consider this privacy setting 
                    before sharing information on the Website.

                    Generally, Smashrun encourages search engine access to the Website and instructs search engines
                    to index âpublicâ user profile pages. SETTING YOUR PROFILE TO âPRIVATEâ PREVENTS
                    SEARCH ENGINES FROM INDEXING YOUR PAGE.
