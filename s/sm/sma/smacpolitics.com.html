<h4>TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED</h4>
<p>The following are the types of information we may collect:</p>
<h5>Web Site Usage Information &amp; IP Address</h5>
<p>We may receive and store certain types of web site usage information whenever you visit the Web Sites. For example, we may collect the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view, other similar information and your IP address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet, and our computers identify your computer by its IP address. We may associate your IP address with the personal information you provide. When analyzed, web site usage information helps us determine how visitors arrive at the Web Sites, what type of content is most popular, and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising.</p>
<h5>Information You Provide Us</h5>
<p>We may ask you to provide us with two types of information: (1) personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, and physical address; and (2) demographic information, such as gender, zip code, or similar information. We may collect this information at various places and forms on the Web Sites, including registration forms for newsletters and other e-mail communications, when you communicate or otherwise interact with us, contests or sweepstakes, surveys or voting or when you purchase a product or service through the Web Sites. You may also be asked to choose a user name and password in order to identify yourself during future visits to the Web Sites. Do not use your real name or the name of any other actual person as your user name. Providing us with information about yourself is your choice, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Web Sites’ features.</p>
<p>For your convenience, if you register with one of our Web Sites through which you create a user name and password, that user name and password may work on the other Web Sites where user names and passwords are utilized. The personal information you provide and any additional information we collect about you may be used by us and across all of the Web Sites.</p>
<h5>Information from Other Sources</h5>
<p>We may receive information about you from other sources; for example, we may obtain geographic or demographic information, or information regarding your possible interests, from third parties, or we may receive information from a marketing partner in connection with a co-branded web site or promotion.. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Web Sites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personal information.</p>
<h5>E-mail A Friend</h5>
<p>If you send a friend an e-mail from the Web Sites, the information you provide (names and e-mail addresses) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain additional consent.</p>
<h4>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED</h4>
<h5>Cookies</h5>
<p>The Web Sites use standard technology called “cookies,” which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you visit the Web Sites and allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your web browser to the Web Sites whenever you visit the Web Sites, and may make navigating and using the Web Sites easier for you. Also, by tracking how and when you use the Web Sites, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Web Sites are based on data obtained from cookies. Additionally, accepting cookies may allow you to, among other things, personalize your experience on the Web Sites. Cookies may also allow the Web Sites to present to you advertising that may be of interest to you as well as limit how often you see certain ads that may detract from your user experience on our Web Sites. If you do not want to allow information to be collected through the use of cookies, you can generally opt out of providing this information by setting your browser to reject cookies. However, please be aware that some areas of the Web Sites may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.</p>
<h5>Web Beacons</h5>
<p>The Web Sites and any e-mails sent by the Web Sites may contain electronic images (generally, single-pixel “.gif” images) called “web beacons.” These web beacons allow Company and third parties to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Company’s use of web beacons on its Web Sites, include, without limitation, the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">counting unique users      (actually, unique web browsers), visits and page views.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">monitoring traffic and conversion patterns through our various product and service offerings on the Web Sites. For example, web beacons may be integrated into a merchandise product page as well as the subsequent shopping cart, transaction and verification pages.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">personalizing your experience      when you visit the Web Sites, including the advertising and content you      see.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">determining whether or not      e-mail messages were opened, links were clicked or notifications/offers      were acted upon.</li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h4>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</h4>
<p>The information you provide to us may be used to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">Send you newsletters and/or      other e-mail communications for which you have registered;</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Contact you about the Web Sites, including, without limitation, in our discretion to notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy, the Web Site’s Terms of Use, or other policies that affect your use of the Web Sites;</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Confirm or fulfill an order      you have made;</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Provide special offers or      promotional materials to you on behalf of us or third parties;</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Contact you with regard to a      sweepstakes, contest or promotion in which you have participated;</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Authorize a purchase or complete a transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the products or other services that you ordered, and, if necessary, to invoice you;</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Monitor or improve the Web      Sites;</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Administer the Web Sites’      systems and for other internal business purposes;</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Customize the advertising and      content you see;</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Comply with and monitor      compliance with our Terms of Use and other applicable agreements and      polices; and</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">For other purposes disclosed      when you provide your information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, if you submit to Company and/or the Web Sites comments, photographs, videos, music, text or other content, it maybe published online or offline (including on-air, on a CD or DVD, through wireless distribution, and transmission of soft copies, or any other media or format currently existing or hereafter developed), and we may publish your name, voice, likeness and other personal information in connection with publishing the content or a portion of the content, and we may use the content and any excerpt from the content in connection with advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities. Please also see “Information You Submit” in our <a href="http://www.cbsdigitalmedia.com/info/tou">Terms of Use</a>, which governs any content you submit through the Web Sites.</p>
<p>Please note that information submitted to the Web Site via a “contact us,” “help” or other similar e-mail address or form will not necessarily receive a response. We will not use the information provided to these e-mail addresses or forms to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request.</p>
<h4>THIRD-PARTY AD SERVING &amp; AUDIENCE AND TRAFFIC MEASUREMENT SERVICES</h4>
<p>The Web Sites may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Web Sites and may use a traffic measurement service to analyze traffic on the Web Sites. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Web Sites and other web sites you have visited.
