In general,  you can visit SmartKeeda.com's Web pages without telling us who you are or  revealing any Personal Information about yourself.</p>
                            <p> By using our Web site, you agree to comply with  our policies. Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how  we collect and use the personal information you provide to us and to assist you  in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and services.</p>

This information may also be used to enable us to enhance your       Site visit, to assist you with customer service or technical support       issues, or to follow up with you after your visit, or to otherwise support       your relationship with SmartKeeda. It is completely optional for you to participate.       However, failure to participate may mean that you cannot access and use       certain information, materials and services. For example, we request       information from you when you:</li>

                                <strong>How we use  information</strong><br>
                                SmartKeeda uses your personal information for  specific purposes only. The personal information you provide to us when using  the Website, such as your name, postal, e-mail address or telephone number will  be kept confidential and used to support your relationship with SmartKeeda to  notify you of special offers, updated information and new products and services  from SmartKeeda, or offers from third parties that we think may be of interest  to you. Agents or contractors of SmartKeeda who are given access to your  personal information will be required to keep the information confidential and  not use it for any other purpose other than to carry out the services they are  performing for SmartKeeda.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Sharing information  with Third Parties</strong><br>
                                SmartKeeda may enhance or merge your information  collected at its Web site with data from third parties for purposes of  marketing products or services to you. With respect to network advertising  companies (companies that manage and provide advertising for numerous unrelated  companies), to the extent that SmartKeeda utilizes such advertising companies  to provide advertisements on the Web site, may provide them with your Sign in  Name and any demographic information about you that we collect. Those  advertising companies may combine that data with non-personally identifiable  data collected by the advertising company from your computer, solely for the  purpose of delivering on our Web site, advertisements that are targeted to you.<br>
                                Circumstances may arise where we are required to  disclose your personal information to third parties for purposes other than to  support your customer relationship with SmartKeeda, such as in connection with  a corporate divestiture or dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our  business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your  personal information), or if disclosure is required by law or is pertinent to  judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings.
                            </p>
                            <p> We will send you information about our various  products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of  interest to you. Only SmartKeeda (or agents or contractors working on behalf of  SmartKeeda and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct  mailings.</p>

                                We may disclose your personal information if  required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is  necessary to (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us  or affiliated parties; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, our  site, the users of our site, and/or our affiliated parties; (c) act under  circumstances to protect the safety of users of our site, us, or third parties.
