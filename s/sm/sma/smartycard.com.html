		<h2>Welcome to the SmartyCard Privacy Policy. </h2>
		
<p><strong>SmartyCard is committed to providing a fun
and safe website for people of all ages. We are dedicated to safeguarding all
personal information collected online and to helping our visitors learn how to
exercise control over personal information while on this site. We do not ask
children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to
participate in a particular activity and we take steps to prevent children from
posting contact information.</strong></p>

<p>Privacy is very important to us. As a
website directed to children, many of whom may be younger than 13, this site
and our privacy practices are governed by a law known as COPPA (the Children's
Online Privacy Protection Act) for our interaction with children. For more
information about COPPA, visit the Federal Trade Commission's FAQ at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm</a>. 
To better protect your privacy, and to help ensure a rewarding online experience for all visitors, we provide this Privacy Policy summarizing our online information practices and explaining the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification
seal located on this page confirms that SmartyCard is a valid licensee and
participating member in the Council of Better Business Bureau's Children's
Advertising Review Unit (CARU) Safe Harbor Program (http://www.caru.org). To
protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative
and our website has been reviewed and certified by CARU to meet established
online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy
program, we are subject to frequent audits of our site and other enforcement
and accountability mechanisms administered independently by CARU.</p>
		
		<h4>I. Definitions</h4>
<p>First, we need to define a few terms so that
you can better understand this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>"Child" or "Children"  COPPA applies to
children under the age of thirteen (13), however for our site these rules are
also applied to children between the ages of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18). We
use the term "Child" or "Children" to refer to all registered users of
SmartyCard under the age of 18. </p>

<p>"Parent" or "Parental"  This also includes
legal  guardians, whether or not a Child lives with them.</p>

<p>"Personally Identifiable Information" or
"PII" this is information that can be traced directly back to and identifies
an individual. PII includes first and last names, e-mail addresses, home
addresses, telephone numbers, and Instant Messaging (IM) screen names when
associated with a particular messaging service (e.g., AIM). </p>

<p>"SmartyCard" is a trademark and tradename of
NR2B Research, Inc. Contact information for SmartyCard and NR2B can be found
below.</p>
		
		<h4>II. Scope of This Privacy Policy</h4>
		
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to PII collected
on SmartyCard's website where this Privacy Policy is posted (the "Site")
and does not apply to any other information collected by SmartyCard and its
affiliated entities through any other means. SmartyCard and its affiliated
entities are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as "SmartyCard,"
"we," "us," or the "Site." It is important for you to
understand this because SmartyCard allows you to select rewards that may
require you to leave the SmartyCard website to visit one of our partner sites.
<b>When you click on one of those links, you leave the SmartyCard site, at
which point our Privacy Policy no longer applies. We encourage you to review
the Privacy Policies of any site you link to from the SmartyCard site.</b> </p>

<p>Here is what we will cover in this Privacy Policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information we may collect</li>
<li>How we use your personal information or the personal information of your children</li>
<li>What cookies and web beacons are and how we use them</li>
<li>What internet protocol addresses are</li>
<li>Collection of information by third-party sites and sponsors</li>
<li>How we secure your information</li>
<li>What choices you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information</li>
<li>How to contact us</li>
<li>What to do if you want to correct or review your personal information</li>
<li>What to do if you have a question or complaint</li>
<li>How we may update our privacy policy</li>
<li>A final note to parents</li>
<li>Our agreement</li>

</ul>
		
		<h4>III. The Information We Collect</h4>
	
	
<p>At SmartyCard, we do not collect PII on our Site
unless our visitors voluntarily provide it to us. We do not collect PII from
children unless a parent has first provided the PII to us and authorized us to
collect such information from their children. For some activities, such as
online polls, leaderboards,or surveys, we may ask visitors to provide
information that is not personally identifiable. This might include first name
only, city or state of residence, age, gender, educational grade level, or a
favorite color. </p>

<p>There are two types of accounts on SmartyCard.
"Child Accounts" are accounts that a Child or a Parent can set up that consist
only of a screen name (which may not be an identifiable Instant Messaging (IM)
screen name), password, grade level and a parental e-mail address. No PII is
collected from Child Accounts and we do not have the ability to contact Child
Account holders directly. We ask for a parental email address for Child
Accounts in order to provide notice to the Parent that his or her child would
like to participate in registration for certain SmartyCard features. </p>

<p>"Parental Accounts" are accounts set up by parents
to link to their children's accounts. We collect PII from Parents and also for
your children if you so authorize. It is necessary to collect PII from
Parents, as we need to be able to verify that a Parent authorized the use of
our Site for their children. Once a Parental Account has been linked to a Child
Account we do not allow the two accounts to be separated (disassociated).</p>

<p>For other activities, such as sending an
electronic postcard or e-mail to invite a friend to join SmartyCard, or to
request account funding from an approved list of adults provided by the
Parental Account, we may also ask for personal information about other people. This
is usually limited to a first name and e-mail address. At the request of the
e-mail address account holder, we will remove this information from our system
and prevent future communications per CANSPAM. E-mail addresses collected to
send an electronic postcard or e-mail to a friend are deleted immediately when
the requested postcard or e-mail is transmitted. For some limited activities,
campaigns, or offers, intended for parents and adults, we may ask a parent or
adult to provide name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number,
credit card information, cable or satellite provider, and/or information about
interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. </p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect names and e-mail
addresses from Children. For activities that require the collection, retention,
and use of personal information, we notify the Parent via e-mail and give the Parent
the option to remove their Child's information from the applicable database for
that activity. For specific one-time requests we receive from visitors, e-mail
addresses are collected and used only in connection with the specific one-time
request. For example, for sweepstakes and contests, e-mail addresses are
collected for the purpose of entering the online sweepstakes or contest on a
one-time basis and are used to notify winners of the sweepstakes or contest
once by e-mail. Winners will be required to return a completed prize
acceptance form contained in the notification e-mail by facsimile or U.S. mail
within a designated time period (along with the signature of a parent or legal
guardian for all minors).</p>

<p>When visitors come to our Site, we also may
collect some non-personally identifiable information such as the type of
computer operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), the type of
browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox), the domain name of
the Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast, Earthlink), your activities while
visiting our Site and your activities while utilizing services on our Site.</p>
	
	
	
		<h4>IV. How We Use the Information</h4>


<p>We use visitors' PII collected in connection
with child-directed activities for internal purposes only, such as enabling
visitors to enter our online contests or sweepstakes or to subscribe to an
online newsletter. We may also use PII to send e-mails regarding special
offers, new partners, or other reminders. These notifications are sent only to
those visitors to the Site who ask to receive them, and for Children, only
after we have received Parental authorization. For some limited activities
directed to parents or adults we may disclose PII to companies whose practices
are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., local cable affiliates,
non-profit organizations) that want to contact you in connection with other
initiatives or marketing products or services to you. If the Site intends to
share a parent's or adult's PII with such third parties, it will provide the
parent or adult with notice or an opportunity to opt out or block future uses
of this nature.</p>

<p>We use parents' e-mail addresses in Parental Accounts,
to notify them when we have received PII such as e-mail addresses from their
children and to give parents the option to remove their child's information from
our databases. We use information we collect about others only to enable
visitors to our Site to communicate with those other people, for example, by
sending them electronic greeting cards or e-mails requesting funding for their
SmartyCards.</p>

<p>We do not keep any PII we obtain through a
contest or sweepstakes beyond when we have successfully selected a winner(s),
awarded the prize(s), and administered the contest or sweepstakes. We only use
the e-mail addresses of subscribers to our Site's e-mail newsletters to send
them the requested newsletter(s). Each newsletter also includes instructions
for subscription removal via return e-mail.</p>

<p>We never sell, rent, or otherwise share our
visitors' personal information with third parties without appropriate consent. Sometimes,
we use agents or contractors to provide services to our visitors, such as
helping us conduct a sweepstakes, sending prizes to winners, shipping rewards,
or providing customer service related to activities on the Site, such as for
billing and some customer support functions. In these cases, we require the
agent or contractor to keep the PII confidential and to use it only for the
specific services they are performing. We sometimes use non-personally
identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of
our Site or services, and to improve our visitors' experience on the Site. We
also may aggregate this information to analyze site usage, as well as to offer
products, programs, or services.</p>

<p>We may disclose PII in response to legal
process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may
disclose PII in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we
believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to
the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, to verify or
enforce compliance with the policies governing our Site and applicable laws, or
as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal
requirements. In addition, we may transfer PII about you if we or one of our
business units are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.</p>

<p>We will not use or transfer PII in ways that
are materially different from the ones described above without also providing
parental notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any
materially different uses.</p>		
		

		<h4>V. Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>
		
<p>Our Site uses a software technology called
"cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors'
computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not
contain any PII. Although cookies could enable us to relate a visitor's use of
our Site to PII that the visitor has provided, such as an e-mail address, we do
not use cookies for this purpose with one exception: for some activities, we
use session cookies to ensure that visitors under the age of 13 provide a
parental email address to assist with our compliance with the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act. We do use cookies to determine how many visitors we
have and how often they visit various sections of our Site.</p>

<p>"Web beacons" are small pieces of
code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the
visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the
users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor
viewing that page. We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time for
this and other purposes.</p>
		

		<h4>VI. What Are Internet Protocol Addresses?</h4>
		<p>An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to
your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). SmartyCard may
track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate
information, site tracking, or to prevent our servers from being abused.</p>
		
		
		<a name="seven"></a>
		<h4>VII. Collection of Information by Third-Party Site and Sponsors</h4>
<p>Our Site contains links to other Web sites,
including those of our partners and sponsors, whose information practices may
be different from ours. Sometimes these third party websites might conduct
contests or sweepstakes that are promoted on our Site and visitors are directed
away from our Site in order to participate in such contests or sweepstakes. Visitors
should consult those other third party websites' privacy notices, since those
websites are not covered by our Privacy Policy and may follow different
procedures. </p>
		
		<h4>VIII. Security</h4>
		
<p>We have taken steps to assure that all
information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free
from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly
controlled. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and
managerial procedures in an effort to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized
access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect
online.</p>

<p>We are particularly sensitive to visitors'
security concerns regarding the use of credit cards to purchase or "load" a
SmartyCard. For orders placed on our Site, we use a technology that
automatically encrypts credit card data while information is being transmitted
over the Internet, provided that the visitor's browser supports the Secure Socket
Layer protocol (SSL).</p>

<p>To verify the security of your connection at
our Site, check the lower left corner of your browser window after accessing
the server. If you see an unbroken or a closed lock, then SSL is active and
the server is secure. You may also check by looking at the URL line of your
browser. When accessing a secure server, the Site address will change from "http"
to "https".</p>
		
		<h4>IX. What choices you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information or that of your linked child</h4>
