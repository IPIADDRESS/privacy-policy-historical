            <h2 class="h2-util">SmartyCard Privacy Policy</h2>

            <h4 class="h4-util">Welcome to the SmartyCard Privacy Policy.</h4>

<p class="p-util">This Privacy Policy was last updated on or about August 5, 2009.</p>

<p class="p-util">SmartyCard is committed to providing a fun and safe website and Service for people of all ages. We are
    dedicated to safeguarding all personal information collected online and to helping our visitors learn how to exercise
    control over personal information while on this site. We do not ask children to disclose personally identifiable
    information and we take steps to prevent children from providing such information. As described below, we do collect
    and use personally identifiable information of adults.</p>

<p class="p-util">Privacy is very important to us. As a website directed to children, many of whom may be younger than
    13, this site and our privacy practices are governed by a law known as COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy
    Protection Act) for our interaction with children. For more information about COPPA, visit the Federal Trade
    Commission's FAQ at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm" class="smcOutBoundLink" rel="external">
    http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm</a>. To better protect your privacy, and to help ensure
    a rewarding online experience for all visitors, we provide this Privacy Policy summarizing our online information
    practices and explaining the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    This Privacy Policy and the certification seal shown on this page confirm that our website submits to the terms of
    ESRB's Privacy Online Program. ESRB's Privacy Online Program is designed to ensure that a website's information
    disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this
    privacy initiative and all of our websites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established
    online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits
    of our websites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by ESRB.
</p>

<a name="one"></a>
<h4 class="h4-util">I. Definitions</h4>

<p class="p-util">
    First, we need to define a few terms so that you can better understand this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    "Child" or "Children" - COPPA applies to children under the age of thirteen (13), however for our site
    these rules are applied to all registered Child Account members.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    "Parent" - This also includes legal guardians, whether or not a Child lives with them. For our site,
    no member under the age of eighteen (18) may register as a Parent.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII" - this is information that can be traced directly back
    to and identifies an individual. PII includes first and last names, e-mail addresses, home addresses, telephone
    numbers, and Instant Messaging (IM) screen names when associated with a particular messaging service (e.g., AIM).
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    "Site" means the SmartyCard website (http://www.smartycard.com) and all related web pages.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    "Service" means all of the activities and functionalities we offer through our Site. Service refers to 
    the product that we provide to you.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    "SmartyCard" is a trademark and tradename of Gazillion, Inc. Contact information for SmartyCard and Gazillion can
    be found below.
</p>

<br>


<a name="two"></a>
<h4 class="h4-util">II. Scope of This Privacy Policy</h4>

<p class="p-util">
    This Privacy Policy applies only to PII collected on SmartyCard's Service where this Privacy Policy is posted
    (the "Site") and does not apply to any other information collected by SmartyCard and its affiliated entities through
    any other means. SmartyCard and its affiliated entities are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as
    "SmartyCard," "we," "us," "Service" or the "Site." It is important for you to understand this because SmartyCard
    allows you to select, through our Site as a part of our Service, "Rewards" that may require you to leave the SmartyCard
    website to visit one of our partner sites. When you click on one of those links, you leave the SmartyCard site, at
    which point our Privacy Policy no longer applies. We provide a notice warning our users when they are leaving our
    Site. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policies of any site you link to from SmartyCard.
</p>

<br>
<p class="p-util"><a href="#">Back to top of SmartyCard Privacy Policy</a></p>
<br>


<a name="three"></a>
<h4 class="h4-util">III. The Information We Collect</h4>

<p class="p-util">There are two types of accounts on SmartyCard. "Child Accounts" are accounts that a Child or a Parent
    can set up that consist only of a first name, screen name (which may not be an identifiable Instant Messaging
    (IM) screen name), password, grade level and a parent e-mail address. We ask for a parent email address in order to
    provide notice to the Parent that his or her child would like to participate in our Site activities.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    We do not ask children to disclose more information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity.
    We currently do not knowingly collect full names and e-mail addresses from Children, and we have safeguards in place to
    prevent children from providing us with PII. For some activities, such as online polls, leaderboards, or surveys, we may
    ask visitors to provide information that is not personally identifiable. This might include first name only, city or
    state of residence, age, gender, educational grade level, or a favorite color. If in the future it comes necessary to
    collect PII in order to participate in a particular activity, we will inform parents prior to so collecting and provide
    an opt-out mechanism (which may then preclude a child from participating in the particular activity).
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    "Parent Accounts" are accounts set up by Parents to link to their children's accounts. While we do not collect PII
    from children, we request PII from Parents. The PII that we collect from Parents include a full name, e-mail address,
    phone number and shipping address. We will also collect and store credit card and billing information if you make a
    purchase or choose to provide the information to us. It is necessary to collect PII from Parents, as we need to be
    able to verify that a Parent authorized the use of our Service for their children, and we require PII in order to
    provide fundamental aspects of our Service. Once a Parent Account has been linked to a Child Account we do not allow
    the two accounts to be separated (disassociated) except in instances where a parent can show valid cause for
    disassociation, based on compelling reasons, including, but not limited to, court-ordered restrictions on parent
    communications with child.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    For other activities, such as sending an electronic postcard or e-mail to invite a friend to join SmartyCard, to
    request account funding from an approved list of adults provided by the Parent Account, or to send a SmartyCard as a
    gift via e-mail, we may also ask for personal information about other people. This is usually limited to a first name
    and e-mail address, and the use of this information by us will be limited to the specific activity the information
    was provided for. At the request of the e-mail address account holder, we will place the e-mail on an internal
    "blacklist" and prevent future communications per CAN-SPAM.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    For specific requests we receive from visitors, e-mail addresses are collected and used only in connection with the
    specific request. For example, for sweepstakes and contests, e-mail addresses are collected for the purpose of entering
    the online sweepstakes or contest on a one-time basis and are used to notify winners of the sweepstakes or contest
    by e-mail. Winners will be required to return a completed prize acceptance form contained in the notification e-mail
    by facsimile or U.S. mail within a designated time period (along with the signature of a parent or legal guardian
    for all minors).
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    When visitors use our Service, we also may collect some non-personally identifiable information such as the type of
    computer operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet
    Explorer, Firefox), the domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast, Earthlink), your activities
    while visiting and utilizing our Services.
</p>

<br>






<a name="four"></a>
<h4 class="h4-util">IV. How We Use the Information</h4>

<p class="p-util">
    We use PII for internal and Service-related purposes only. We require PII to enable parents to approve their child's
    account, to mail out physical goods to a shipping address, to process payment information, and to allow people to
    enter our online contests or sweepstakes or to subscribe to an online newsletter or other various marketing alerts or
    notifications.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    We use PII collected during Account registration to send commercial e-mails (with a predominantly marketing focus)
    regarding special offers, new partners, or other site notifications and reminders. We will not send commercial e-mails
    to customers who choose to opt-out. Every commercial e-mail we send out includes instructions for opting out of our
    mailing list.
</p>


<p class="p-util">
    Parents who have active SmartyCard accounts may still receive business-related (transactional) e-mails, such as
    payment receipts, disbursement notifications and account or site changes, even if they opt-out of marketing e-mails.
    Please see section IX of our Privacy Policy if you would like to have your PII or your child's information removed
    completely from our system.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention. Credit card information and other
    sensitive personal information required to process a purchase is not used for any other purpose by our financial
    services providers or us and will not be kept longer than necessary for providing the services offered by us.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    We do not use PII we obtain through a specific request, such as Beta notification, gift notification, newsletters,
    marketing notifications or contests for anything not in connection with that specific request, unless that PII is
    already connected to an existing customer account.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    We never sell, rent, or otherwise share our visitors' personal information with third parties without appropriate
    consent. Sometimes, we use agents or contractors to provide services to our visitors, such as helping us conduct a
    sweepstakes, sending prizes to winners, shipping rewards, or providing customer service related to activities on the
    Site, such as for billing and some customer support functions. In these cases, we require the agent or contractor to
    keep the PII confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing. We sometimes use
    non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our Site or services,
    and to improve our visitors' experience on the Site. We also may aggregate this information to analyze site usage,
    as well as to offer products, programs, or services.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    We may disclose PII in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also
    may disclose PII in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to
    investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
    threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, to verify or enforce compliance
    with the policies governing our Service and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by law or
    consistent with legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer PII about you if we or one of our business units
    are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.
</p>

<p class="p-util">We reserve the right to transfer all PII in our system in the event that SmartyCard or its parent
    company Gazillion, Inc., is sold, merged or otherwise assigned such that control rests with a different entity. We
    will not use or transfer PII in ways that are materially different from the ones described above without also
    providing parental notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different uses.

<h4 class="h4-util">V. Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>

<p class="p-util">
    Our Site uses a software technology called "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors'
    computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any PII. Although cookies could
    enable us to relate a visitor's use of our Site to PII that the visitor has provided, such as an e-mail address,
    we do not use cookies for this purpose with one exception: for some activities, we use session cookies to assist
    with our compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act by ensuring that visitors under the age of 13
    are not asked to provide PII. We do use cookies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit
    various sections of our Site.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    "Web beacons" are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the
    visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to
    deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time
    for this purpose.

<h4 class="h4-util">VI. What Are Internet Protocol Addresses?</h4>

<p class="p-util">
    An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service
    Provider ("ISP"). SmartyCard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information,
    site tracking, or to prevent our servers from being abused.

<h4 class="h4-util">VII. Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</h4>

<p class="p-util">
    Our Site contains links to other Web sites, including those of our partners and sponsors, whose information practices
    may be different from ours. Sometimes these third party websites might conduct contests or sweepstakes that are
    promoted on our Site and visitors are directed away from our Site in order to participate in such contests or
    sweepstakes. Visitors should consult those other third party websites' privacy notices, since those websites are not
    covered by our Privacy Policy and may follow different procedures.

<h4 class="h4-util">VIII. Security</h4>

<p class="p-util">
    We have taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free
    from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. We have put in place
    appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized
    access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    We are particularly sensitive to visitors' security concerns regarding the use of credit cards to purchase a
    SmartyCard or "fund" a SmartyCard account. For orders placed on our Site, we use a technology that automatically
    encrypts credit card data while information is being transmitted over the Internet, provided that the visitor's
    browser supports the Secure Socket Layer protocol (SSL).
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    To verify the security of your PC's web connection at our Service, check the lower left corner of your browser window
    after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken or a closed lock, then SSL is active and the server is secure. You
    may also check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the Site address will
    change from "http" to "https".

</ul>


<a name="kidOne"></a>
<h4 class="h4-util">1. Introduction</h4>
<p class="p-util">
    Building on our general Privacy Policy, SmartyCard recognizes the need to provide additional privacy protections when
    children under the age of 13 visit the SmartyCard Websites. Our Kids' Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use
    personal information collected online from children. It also describes how parents can review the personal information
    that we have collected.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    For your convenience, the Kids' Privacy Policy uses terms that are defined in our general Privacy Policy, shown above.
    A link to our privacy policies is also posted at the bottom of each SmartyCard Website.
</p>

<br>
<p class="p-util"><a href="#">Back to top of SmartyCard Privacy Policy</a></p>
<br>




<a name="kidTwo"></a>
<h4 class="h4-util">2. Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Information</h4>
<p class="p-util">
    We allow children to surf the SmartyCard Websites, look at content, and play some games without giving us any 
    personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    During registration for the SmartyCard Websites, SmartyCard requests and collects from children their first name,
    grade level, a screen name, a password and a parent's e-mail address.  We collect a parent's e-mail address to let
    parents know that their child has signed up with the SmartyCard Websites, to verify their consent and send future
    notices about their child's account. 
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    Please note that any sites directed at children under 13 are prohibited by law from conditioning a child's
    participation in an online activity on the child's providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    SmartyCard does not sell, market, trade, or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information to third parties
    outside of our company. We will not use any of the information we collect from any registrant of the SmartyCard
    Websites for any purpose other than to access the website, e-mailings as described above and for the purposes of
    contacting the parent. Situations in which we may share a child's personal information with third parties would
    include those in which it is reasonably necessary to: protect the security of integrity of the SmartyCard Websites;
    to take precautions against liability; to respond to judicial process; or to the extent permitted under provisions of
    law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies, or for an investigation related to public safety.
</p>

<p class="p-util">
    For additional information about how SmartyCard safeguards the personal information of its members please see our
    general Privacy Policy above.

<br>

<br>




<a name="kidThree"></a>
<h4 class="h4-util">3. Electronic Postcards</h4>
<p class="p-util">
    All electronic postcards accessible on the SmartyCard Websites request that users furnish an e-mail address. This is
    necessary to send the postcards electronically. The e-mail addresses are deleted from our servers and not distributed
    to third parties or used for any other purposes than sending the postcards.
</p>

<br>
<p class="p-util"><a href="#">Back to top of SmartyCard Privacy Policy</a></p>
<br>





<a name="kidFour"></a>
<h4 class="h4-util">4. Technical Methods</h4>
<p class="p-util">
    If a parent allows their child to register with the SmartyCard Websites and for us to collect personal information 
    about their child, we may link certain Technical Methods to that personal information. These Technical Methods allow 
    us to operate the SmartyCard Websites more effectively, make them more interesting and useful to you and are beneficial 
    for various purposes related to our business. We do not however collect any additional personally identifiable 
    information via these Technical Methods. For further information about the particular Technical Methods used on the 
    SmartyCard Websites, please see our general Privacy Policy under the sub-headings: "V. Cookies and Web Beacons" and 
    "VI. What are Internet Protocol Addresses."

<br>





<a name="kidFive"></a>
<h4 class="h4-util">5. Sweepstakes and Contests</h4>
<p class="p-util">
    If a child enrolls in a sweepstakes or contest, only enough information as is required to enroll in the sweepstakes
    or contest will be collected. After the drawing or contest is concluded, we will not retain any additional personally
    identifiable information collected beyond the information already provided at the time of registration for the
    SMARTYCARD Websites. If a child wins a sweepstakes or contest, we notify the parent at the parent's e-mail address
    provided to us during the registration process and request that the parent provide their postal address for purposes
    of delivering the prize. We may publish a winner's first name, first initial of last name, city, and state of residence
    on the SMARTYCARD Websites.
</p>

<br>

<br>





<a name="kidSix"></a>
<h4 class="h4-util">6. Parental Consent</h4>
<p class="p-util">
    We require that parents give us express permission for their child to register with the SmartyCard Websites.
    Additionally, at any time parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their child
    and can request that any personal information we have collected be deleted from our database. The parent will need to
    have their child's member name and password. If the password has been lost or forgotten, there are instructions on the
    SmartyCard Parent Account page explaining how to recover or set a new password for access. There are three methods
    for a parent to access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from their
    children:
</p>

<ul class="p-util" style="list-style-type:decimal; margin-left:23px;">
    <li>
        Using the e-mail first sent to them by SmartyCard, a parent can click on the link provided to take them to
        the SmartyCard Parent Account page. Once linked to this page a parent will be able to log in to their child's
        account, review, change or delete any of their child's personal information, as well as update their child's
        password.
    </li>
    <li>
        A parent can access their child's account information using the following
        link: <a href="https://www.smartycard.com/tp/login.html">https://www.smartycard.com/tp/login.html</a>, which will
        direct them to the SmartyCard Parent Account page. Once linked to this page, a parent can log in to their child's
        account, review, change or delete any of their child's personal information, as well as update their child's password.
    </li>
    <li>
        A parent can also visit www.SmartyCard.com. By clicking the link at the top of the home page entitled
        "For Parents" they will be provided with informative text. A link to the SmartyCard Parent Account page is provided
        under the subheading "Parent Account" By following the link, a parent will be able to use their information to
        review, change or delete any of their child's personal information as well as update their child's password. 
    </li>
</ul>

<br>





<a name="kidSeven"></a>
<h4 class="h4-util">7. Links to Other Sites</h4>
<p class="p-util">
    When children click on links from the SmartyCard Websites to other sites, we may open the other sites in a new browser
    window. We make every effort to only link the SmartyCard Websites to appropriate outside sites for children, and will
    advise a user when leaving the SmartyCard Websites. Unlike the SmartyCard Websites, however, these outside sites may
    collect personal information, which is outside of the control of SmartyCard.
</p>

<br>




<a name="kidEight"></a>
<h4 class="h4-util">8. Amendments to this Policy</h4>
<p class="p-util">
    We may amend our Kids' Privacy Policy at any time. We will provide parents notice by e-mail in the event of any
    material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share a child's personal information. Please note that,
    at all times, parents should keep their personal information updated and provide us with current e-mail addresses.
    SmartyCard will only apply material changes to the Kids' Privacy Policy in conformance with applicable law, including
    any applicable provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act that require parental consent.
