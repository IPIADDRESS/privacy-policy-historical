Your individual usage cannot be tracked through aggregate data. 
<br><br>
As is standard practice on many web sites, SpadeClub may use "cookies" and other technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand which parts of our web site is the most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there.   In addition, we have contracted with Morning Falls to monitor certain pages of our website for the purpose of reporting certain advertising traffic, statistics, and advertisement 'click-throughs'.  Where authorized by us, Morning Falls may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our website visitors.  No personally identifiable information is collected by or transferred to any party other than information you may provide to an advertiser. For more information about how the information is collected and used by Morning Falls, please see Morning Falls's privacy policy at http://www.morningfalls.com/network/privacy.php.

We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving.

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number numbers) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
