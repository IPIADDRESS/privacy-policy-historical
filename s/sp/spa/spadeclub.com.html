We may store non-personally identifiable information that we collect through log files to create a profile of our users in the aggregate. Log files record internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks which we will use to analyze trends, administer the  Service or SpadeClub website, track aggregate service and usage patterns, and gather broad demographic information for general use. Your individual usage cannot be tracked through aggregate data. 
<br><br>
As is standard practice on many web sites, SpadeClub may use "cookies" and other technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand which parts of our web site is the most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there.   In addition, we have contracted with Morning Falls to monitor certain pages of our website for the purpose of reporting certain advertising traffic, statistics, and advertisement 'click-throughs'.  Where authorized by us, Morning Falls may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our website visitors.  No personally identifiable information is collected by or transferred to any party other than information you may provide to an advertiser. For more information about how the information is collected and used by Morning Falls, please see Morning Falls's privacy policy at http://www.morningfalls.com/network/privacy.php.

We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services. We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving. You may opt-out of receiving these offers by changing this option in your Account settings.

<br><br><p class="gray-dark"><b>Security</b></p>

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number numbers) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

<br><br><p class="gray-dark"><b>Compliance with Legal Process</b></p>
We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our the  Service or SpadeClub web sites; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).

<br><br>We have contracted with Morning Falls to monitor certain pages of our website for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement 'click-throughs', and/or other activities on our website.
