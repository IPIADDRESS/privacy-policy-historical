		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>SparkTrust Systems Inc. (“SparkTrust Systems”), makers of CommunityReviewed, is committed to protecting the privacy of any personal information you may submit and provide to us when visiting this website and/or using any of our services.

We also give our users the option of receiving useful product and Service information (such as Service updates, Service alerts, Service outages and/or any associated product offerings), via opt-in permission based email. We fully ensure your privacy and value your trust. We will never sell, rent, lease or trade your personal information to any third party. Likewise, your personal information will not be shared with a third party in any other way unless SparkTrust Systems is required to do so by law. SparkTrust Systems may engage the services of a third party from time to time and may provide certain information that includes personal information in order for the third party to perform such services. Any third parties who provide services to SparkTrust Systems have agreed not to disclose your information or use it for any other purpose, and are required to implement or adopt a Privacy Policy that is no less stringent than SparkTrust Systems’ Privacy Policy. You may opt out of receiving emails from us at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email. By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted in order to purchase, register, subscribe, or access any of the Services, you are consenting to SparkTrust Systems’ collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes as outlined herein. </p> 
<p>Any information that you post to a chat room, public bulletin or forum is available to all users of that site. SparkTrust Systems cannot control, nor is it responsible for the use, disclosure, or dissemination of such information by any third parties. </p>
