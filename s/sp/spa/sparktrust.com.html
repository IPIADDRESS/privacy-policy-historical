		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>SparkTrust Systems Inc. (“SparkTrust Systems”), makers of eTrue, is committed to protecting the privacy of any personal information you may submit and provide to us when visiting this website and/or using any of our services. This Privacy Policy describes SparkTrust Systems’ policy with respect to its collection, use, and disclosure of any personal information.</p> 

<p>Information Collection</p> 
<p>When you purchase, register, subscribe or use any of the SparkTrust Systems services (“Services”), we may collect personal information which may include, without limitation, your name, address, email address, and phone number for the purpose of recording the transaction, your registration, your subscription, or tracking your usage when you engage in activities on our web site or within the Services. When we use a payment processing merchant we ensure that the same strict privacy criteria are in place. We do not (knowingly) collect personal information from persons under the age of eighteen. We also give our users the option of receiving useful product and Service information (such as Service updates, Service alerts, Service outages and/or any associated product offerings), via opt-in permission based email. We fully ensure your privacy and value your trust. We will never sell, rent, lease or trade your personal information to any third party. Likewise, your personal information will not be shared with a third party in any other way unless SparkTrust Systems is required to do so by law. SparkTrust Systems may engage the services of a third party from time to time and may provide certain information that includes personal information in order for the third party to perform such services. Any third parties who provide services to SparkTrust Systems have agreed not to disclose your information or use it for any other purpose, and are required to implement or adopt a Privacy Policy that is no less stringent than SparkTrust Systems’ Privacy Policy. You may opt out of receiving emails from us at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email. By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted in order to purchase, register, subscribe, or access any of the Services, you are consenting to SparkTrust Systems’ collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes as outlined herein. </p> 
<p>Any information that you post to a chat room, public bulletin or forum is available to all users of that site. SparkTrust Systems cannot control, nor is it responsible for the use, disclosure, or dissemination of such information by any third parties. </p>

<li>To enable us to personalize content, advertising and promotions based on preferences, needs, suggestions, or recommendations. </li>
<li>To provide advance notice of termination of a trial period or your Service subscription, or an opportunity to extend a trial period, subscription, or advance notice of expiration of your right to use the Services. </li>

<p>We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our service agreements or terms of use (for example protect our intellectual property rights), and your compliance with the applicable Terms of Use contained within the Services. We may also disclose or use your personal information if we are required to under applicable law. </p> 

<p>Cookies</p> 
<p>We define a cookie as any string of data and information that is automatically stored on your computer upon access to our Services.
