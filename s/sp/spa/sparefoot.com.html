  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><font>This Privacy Policy covers the use of 
the Homstie website at <a href="http://www.homstie.com/" target="_blank">www.homstie.com</a> ("Homstie") and is designed to assist you 
in understanding how Homstie collects and uses the personal information 
you provide to Homstie and to assist you in making informed decisions 
when using our site and our products and services.  Pursuant to 
Homstie's Terms of Use, you must be 18 years and older to use this 
site.  Therefore this policy makes no provision for individuals 
under 18 years of age.</font></p>

<p><font>This Privacy Policy applies when you 
visit Homstie.com or share your personally identifiable information 
with Homstie, as discussed below.  By using the website, you accept 
this Privacy Policy, which may be updated by us at any time.  If 
you do not agree to this Privacy Policy for any reason, please do not 
use this website or share your personally identifiable information with 
us as discussed below.  Please note that this Privacy Policy applies 
only to this website, and not to any other website linked to or from 
it.  We do not control the privacy policies or practices of others.  
We encourage you to ask questions and read the privacy policies of other 
websites before you disclose any personal information.</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>What Information Do We Collect?</u></b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font>When you visit Homstie, you may provide 
us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly 
choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web 
site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others 
browse our Web site.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>Personal Information You Choose 
to Provide</u></b></font> <br></p>
<p><font><b>Registration Information</b></font></p>

<p><font>When you sign up for a Homstie account or other Homstie service, we will ask you for personal information such as your name, user name, email address and an account password. For some services, we will ask you for credit card or other payment account information, a billing address and details about the property you are listing or renting which we will store in encrypted form on secure servers. Homstie will not sell or disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties without your explicit consent, except as specified in the Privacy Policy. Except as stated herein, only those persons who Homstie reasonably believes need access will have access to your personal information. This includes, but is not limited to, the disclosure of the renter's email address to the lister upon a successful application for storage space.  Your personal information may be combined with information Homstie collects or acquires from other companies and used to improve and personalize services, content and advertising. Homstie may store your personal information for as long as your account has not been deactivated by you. You may deactivate your account by emailing <a href="mailto:support@homstie.com">support@homstie.com</a>.</font></p>
<p><font>
As part of the listing and renting process, you may obtain personal information about another Homstie user such as that user's email address, physical address, telephone number and/or other information. This information should only be used for Homstie-related communications and transactions and for no other purpose. You are not authorized or licensed to use this information for any other purpose including, without limitation, the sending of unsolicited commercial messages. You are not authorized to add any Homstie user to any email or physical mail list.</font></p>

<p><font><b>Personal Information You Post in Public 
Areas</b></font></p>

<p><font>When you post a message in a Homstie 
forum, chatroom, review or customer feedback, or if you post personal 
information on your Homstie Profile, your Homstie Username is visible 
to other users as is any personal information you may post.  If 
you post personal information anywhere on the website that is accessible 
to the public or other Homstie users, you are advised that such personally 
identifiable information can be read, collected, used or disseminated 
by others and could be used to send you unsolicited information or otherwise.  
Accordingly, you assume full responsibility for posting such information 
and agree that Homstie is not responsible in any way for personally 
identifiable information you choose to post in these public areas.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font><b>Service-Related Communications</b></font></p>
<p><font>When you sign up for a Homstie account 
or service, we will send you a welcome email confirming your sign up.  
Homstie may also send you other service-related messages when, in our 
sole discretion, it is necessary or advisable to do so.  You may 
not opt out of these service-related communications.  If you do 
not want to receive these messages, you may deactivate your account 
by emailing <a href="mailto:support@homstie.com" target="_blank">support@homstie.com</a> from the email address you originally used to 
sign up.  If you do deactivate your account, please be advised 
that your personal information may remain in Homstie's records for 
some period of time.</font> <br></p>

<p><font><b>Administrative Communications</b></font></p>
<p><font>From time to time, Homstie may send you 
administrative messages by email.  </font> <br></p>

<p><font><b>Email Information</b></font></p>
<p><font>If you choose to correspond with us through 
email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with 
your email address and our responses. </font> <br></p>

<p><font><b>Web Site Use Information</b></font></p>
<p><font>Similar to other commercial websites, 
Homstie utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see 
explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and webserver logs 
to collect information about how Homstie is used. Information gathered 
through cookies and webserver logs may include the date and time of 
visits, the pages viewed, IP address, type of computer used to access 
the website, language, type of web browers, time spent at our website, 
and the websites visited just before and just after visiting Homstie.  
We, our advertisers and ad serving companies may also use small technology 
or pieces of code to determine which advertisements and promotions users 
have seen and how users responded to them.</font></p>

<p><font>We use third-party advertising companies 
to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information 
(not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) 
about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements 
about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more 
information about this practice and to know your choices about not having 
this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">click 
here</a>.</font> <br></p>
<p><font>Homstie uses the Google AdSense network, 
a service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"), to display ads on 
our website. Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve 
ads on our site.  Users may opt out of the use of this cookie, 
called the "DART cookie", by visiting the Google ad and c<a name="0.1__Hlt88896873"></a>ontent 
network privacy policy <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">here</a>. </font> <br></p>
<p><font>Homstie uses Google Analytics, a web 
analytics service provided by Google, which uses cookies and tracking 
code to help analyze how visitors use the website.  The information 
collected (including what browser and operating system is being used, 
the user's IP address, the pages on Homstie's website that the user 
has visited, the number of page views, and the time spent on the website) 
is transmitted to and stored by Google.  Google uses this information 
for the purpose of evaluating visitors' use of the website in an aggregate 
manner, compiling reports on website activity for website operators 
and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet 
usage.  Google may transfer this information to third parties where 
required to do so by law, or to third parties that process information 
on Google's behalf.  Google's Privacy Policy can be read at <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>How Do We Use the Information That 
You Provide to Us?</u></b></font></p>
<p><font>Broadly speaking, we use personal information 
for purposes of administering and expanding our business activities, 
providing customer service and making available other products and services 
to our customers and prospective customers. Homstie may use the personally 
identifiable information you provide to contact users and deliver information 
and/or marketing and promotional materials, including through postal 
mail, e-mail, and other means, as well as to improve its marketing and 
promotional efforts, and to analyze website usage, improve its content 
and product offerings, and customize its website content, layout, and 
services.</font>
 <br><br> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>What Are Cookies?</u></b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font>A cookie is a very small text document, 
which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit 
a website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to 
store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated 
for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if 
your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your 
browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already 
sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.  Some 
of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies that originate 
from their sites. We have no access or control over those cookies.  </font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>How Do We Use Information We Collect 
from Cookies?</u></b></font> <br></p>
<p><font>As you use our website, the site uses 
its cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we 
also use cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements 
or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, 
in conjunction with our web server's log files, allow us to calculate 
the aggregate number of people visiting our website and which parts 
of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order 
to constantly improve our website and better serve our customers. Cookies 
do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we 
do not generally store any personal information that you provided to 
us in your cookies.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>Sharing Information with Third 
Parties</u></b></font> <br></p>
<p><font>We may enter into alliances, partnerships 
or other business arrangements with third parties who, WITH YOUR EXPLICIT 
CONSENT, may be given access to personal information including your 
name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing 
you information regarding products and services that we think will be 
of interest to you.  </font></p>
<p><font>We also use third parties to facilitate 
our business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing 
credit card payments. In connection with these offerings and business 
operations, our partners and other third parties may have access to 
your personal information for use in connection with business activities. 
As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. 
Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred 
business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer 
such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or 
any dissolution.</font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>Notice of New Services and Changes</u></b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font>Occasionally, we may also use the information 
we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new 
services and special offers we think you will find valuable. As our 
customer, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire 
not to receive these offers by sending us an email request at <a href="mailto:support@homstie.com" target="_blank">support@homstie.com</a>.</font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</u></b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font>Email is not recognized as a secure medium 
of communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send private 
information to us by email. Some of the information you enter on our 
website may be transmitted securely via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), 
128 bit encryption services. Pages utilizing this technology will have 
URLs that start with HTTPS instead of HTTP. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@homstie.com" target="_blank">support@homstie.com</a> if you have any questions or concerns.</font></p>

<p><font>However, as you probably know, third 
parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private 
communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information 
that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard 
to protect your privacy, we do not promise or guarantee, and you should 
not expect, that your personal information or private communications 
will always remain private.</font>
 <br><br></p>
 
<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>How Can You Access and Update Your 
Information? </u></b></font> <br></p>
<p><font>You may request access to all your personally 
identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our 
database by emailing <a href="mailto:support@homstie.com" target="_blank">support@homstie.com</a>.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>Certain Disclosures</u></b></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font>We may disclose your personal information 
if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action 
is necessary to (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process 
served on us or affiliated parties; (b) protect and defend our rights 
and property, our site, the users of our site, and/or our affiliated 
parties; (c) act under circumstances to protect the safety of users 
of our site, us, or third parties.</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>What About Other Web Sites Linked 
to Our Web Site?</u></b></font> <br></p>
<p><font>We are not responsible for the practices 
employed by websites linked to or from our website nor the information 
or content contained therein. Often links to other websites are provided 
solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the 
users of our website. </font></p>
<p><font>Please remember that when you use a link 
to go from our website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no 
longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, 
including websites which have a link on our website, is subject to that 
website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies 
before proceeding.</font></p>
<br>

<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>Phishing, Spoofing and Spamming</u></b></font><br></p>
<p><font>Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' 
personal identity data and financial
account credentials.  'Phishers' use 'spoofed' e-mails 
to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients 
into divulging Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account 
usernames, passwords, and social security numbers.  <b>WE DO NOT 
SEND E-MAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION 
OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!  </b>
If you receive such e-mail communication, please forward it immediately 
to the Site's Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:support@homstie.com" target="_blank">support@homstie.com</a> and then immediately delete the fraudulent e-mail 
from your computer.  We do not engage in the indiscriminate sending 
of unsolicited bulk messages ("spamming").</font>
<br><br></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>Privacy and Safety of Children</u></b></font><br></p>
<p><font>Homstie is concerned about the safety 
and privacy of children who use the Internet.  Homstie.com is not 
designed for or directed to children under the age of 13 and requires 
by its Terms of Use that users are 18 years of age or older.  If 
you are under the age of 13, please discontinue use of the site.  
Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 
("COPPA"), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable 
information from anyone under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.   
If we become aware that a child under 13 has somehow provided us with 
personally identifiable information without verifiable parental consent, 
we will use our best efforts to remove such information from our files.  
If you believe that your child has provided us with such information 
without your consent, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@homstie.com" target="_blank">privacy@homstie.com</a> or write 
to us at Homstie, Inc., Attn: Privacy Dept., 445 Landfair Ave, Suite 
202, Los Angeles, CA 90024.</font>
<br><br></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times"><b><u>Disclaimer Regarding International 
Use</u></b></font><br></p>

<p><font>Homstie makes no claim that Homstie.com 
is appropriate or lawful for use or access outside the United States.  
Furthermore, our databases are located in the United States.  If 
you access this website from outside the United States, you do so at 
your own risk.  You are solely responsible for complying with all 
local laws, rules and regulations regarding online conduct and website 
access.  By sending us your data, you consent to its transfer to

</p>
<p><font>Neither Homstie nor any 
of its employees are attorneys; Homstie is not a law firm.  Homstie 
can only provide self help services at your specific direction.  
Homstie cannot represent you in court, advise you about your legal rights 
or the law, or select legal forms for you.  Although Homstie strives 
to keep its legal documents accurate, current and up-to-date, due to 
rapid changes in the law Homstie cannot guarantee that all the information 
on the site is completely current. The law is different from jurisdiction 
to jurisdiction, and is also subject to interpretation by different 
courts. The law is a personal matter, and no general legal document 
like the kind Homstie provides can fit every circumstance. Furthermore, 
the legal information contained on this site is not legal advice and 
is not guaranteed to be correct, complete or up-to-date. Therefore, 
if you need legal advice for your specific problem, or if your specific 
problem is too complex to be addressed by our tools, you should consult 
a licensed attorney in your area.</font></p>
<p><font>This site is not intended 
to create any attorney-client relationship, and by using Homstie, no 
attorney-client relationship will be created with Homstie. Instead, 
you are representing yourself in any legal matter you undertake through 
Homstie's legal document service.  Homstie is not a law firm, 
and the employees of Homstie are not acting as your attorney. Homstie's 
legal document service is not a substitute for the advice of an attorney. 
Homstie, Inc. is a registered and bonded Legal Document Assistant, Registration 
#: LDA-367, Los Angeles County (exp. 08/25/2010). Homstie cannot provide 
legal advice and can only provide self-help services at your specific 
direction. Homstie does not perform the legal services that an attorney 
performs.</font>
