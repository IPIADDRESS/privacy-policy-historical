			<div id="tips"><p>With the advent of wireless Internet, more and more computer users are entering the world of cyber space.</p>
			<p>Yet, while these users are well aware of the importance of the protection of their computer when hooked up to regular internet providers, they are often oblivious to the fact that the same cyber dangers, and in fact even more, exist in the world of WiFi.</p>
			<p>What you may not know is that same Internet connection that makes it possible to check your email from the comfort of your bed also makes it easier for hackers to access your personal information.</p>
			<p>It is for this reason, the sharing of the wireless Internet connection, that protecting your computer when wireless is even more important than ever before.</p></div>
