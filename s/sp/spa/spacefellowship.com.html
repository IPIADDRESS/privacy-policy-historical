			</p><h3>What are Cookies?</h3> A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Your browser’s help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by&nbsp;ISF to track user preferences while the user is visiting the website. They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing. Persistent cookies may be used by&nbsp;ISF to store whether, for example, you want your password remembered or not, and other information. Cookies used on the&nbsp;ISF website do not contain personally identifiable information.
		<p></p>
		<p>
			</p><h3>Log Files</h3> Like most standard websites, we use log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

		<p></p>
		<p>
			</p><h2>Disclosure of Information</h2> ISF may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from users to the public. In such cases, only statistical information will be disclosed and personally identifiable data will be kept strictly confidential.

		<p></p>

			</p><h2>Maintenance of Information</h2> The information provided to&nbsp;ISF is saved indefinitely and may be stored on one or more databases directly or indirectly maintained by ISF.&nbsp;ISF employs industry-standard security measures to protect the confidentiality of the information. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur; we make every effort to prevent such occurrences. Any other particularly sensitive information, such as passwords, is encrypted prior to being stored by ISF.
		<p></p>
		<p>
			</p><h2>Your Responsibility</h2> You are responsible for the security of your&nbsp;usernames and passwords. Make sure you keep them in a safe place and do not share them with others. Always remember to log out after your session ends to ensure that others cannot access your private personal information.
