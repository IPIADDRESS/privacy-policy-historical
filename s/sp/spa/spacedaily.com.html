<font face="Arial" size="+1"><b>Privacy Statement</b><br></font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Arial">
<b>Space.TV Corp and SpaceDaily.com</b><br>
Space.TV Corp, and its advertisers and affiliates are committed to protecting the privacy of its users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="Arial">

<b>Consumer Information</b><br>

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code). If this does occur, Space.TV Corp or its advertising agents may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, Space.TV Corp or its agents may combine this information with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="Arial">

<b>Data Collection and Opt Out Procedure</b><br>
Space.TV Corp or its advertising agents may use "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. Space.TV Corp cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="Arial">

<b>What are cookies and why do we use them?</b><br>
A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time a Space.TV Corp advertising agent utilising this technology serves you an ad. For example, one of our network advertising agencies Engage issues a unique number from its banner engine, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer. This cookie can help Engage target ads to you, reducing multiple ad views. While we believe cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for Space.TV Corp to deliver Engage advertising banners to you.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="Arial">

If you do not want the benefit of the Engage network cookie, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="Arial">
