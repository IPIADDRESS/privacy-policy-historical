        <p>Readdle takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").</p>

        <h1 id="privacy_1">Introduction</h1>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect when you use our Spark mobile app product ("Spark") and what we do with this information. The information is used solely for purposes of providing better service to you. We do not loan, rent or sell information to others, other than as stated herein. This Privacy Policy applies only to our Spark app. Please see our general privacy policy that applies to our other products at&nbsp;<a href="https://readdle.com/privacy">readdle.com/privacy</a>.</p>
        <p>We are committed to protect your privacy. We collect two types of information through the Spark app: General Statistical Information and Personal Information.</p>

        <h1 id="privacy_2">General Statistical Information</h1>
        <p>When you use the Spark app we gather statistics and analytics on your usage of Spark. We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the application-specific device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information, location, installed email, etc. This information is collectively referred to as "General Statistical Information". This data helps us to determine how different parts of the Spark app are used. This information is used by us to provide you with the best user experience possible.</p>
        <p>We use third party services, such as Google Analytics, Facebook Analytics and Amplitude, to collect and analyze how you use Spark. These services may collect information about you and your usage of Spark in accordance with their respective privacy policies.</p>

        <h1 id="privacy_3">Personal Information</h1>
        <p>In addition to General Statistical Information we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. Information that can reasonably be used to identify you is referred to as "Personal Information". The first email you add to Spark is used as your username. We might use that email address to reach out to you periodically with information about features, updates, announcements or to request your feedback. All general email activity is mostly done on your device. Our servers are only involved for delivering the push notifications and, in some cases, for sending your email messages.</p>
        <p>Accounts are added to Spark through OAuth where possible. Where OAuth is not supported we keep your account username and password on our secure servers. We then use the authorization provided to download your emails to our virtual servers and push to your device. We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure to store your data. Apart from the AWS' security policies we take a number of measures to ensure that your data is never read by anyone else. We ensure that all transmission is secured with HTTPS so that no one else can access your data. Your account credentials are stored on secure cloud-based servers using asymmetric encryption.</p>
        <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. You should not share your email user name and password with anyone. If you find out that anyone has improperly obtained your login credentials and accesses your email account through Spark, you should immediately change your password. We are not responsible for such unauthorized access unless the access is our fault.</p>
        <p>Primary function of Spark servers is to send push notifications and badge numbers to your device. To do that, Spark servers download email headers and text parts from your email service provider and use them to compose push notifications. We delete email headers and text as soon as push message has been prepared and sent. We store messages and emails in encrypted form on secure cloud-based servers.</p>
        <p>When you delete your email account from Spark, we permanently delete your data and credentials from our servers after we get notification from the Spark app or from Apple Push Notifications Service. If you turn off Push Notifications for your email account on all devices we will delete it from our servers as well.</p>
        <p>To provide you with synchronization of your email accounts and settings between different devices, we encrypt authorization information and user settings with unique encryption key stored in your iCloud account, out of our own reach, and sync it with other devices through our servers (we currently use Firebase for this purpose). We keep this information even after you deleted Spark from all your devices to allow you restore your accounts and settings quickly in case of application reinstall. However, since we don't have access to the encryption key, your data are completely secured.</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personally identifiable information such as email address or name from children under the age of 13, we will promptly delete it. Parents and guardians can contact us on&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rdsupport@readdle.com">rdsupport@readdle.com</a>&nbsp;if they are aware that their child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent.</p>
        <p>The support queries you write to us about might contain Personal Information. We use information in these queries solely to help you resolve the issues reported and improve the product quality.</p>

        <h1 id="privacy_4">Use of Email Addresses</h1>
        <p>When you start to use Spark we collect email address of the first email account you connected to the app. We use it as primary way to let you know about important Spark announcements and send you tips and tricks on getting most of the app. You can always opt-out of receiving email messages and newsletters from us. Unsubscribe instructions are located within each newsletter and on our Website, or you may contact our&nbsp;<a href="https://readdle.com/support">customer support</a>&nbsp;team and ask them to unsubscribe you manually.</p>
        <p>When you contact our customer support via email or using our online form your email will be retained in our customer support system. We may use this email to contact you later with updates about your request, with information about related features and other announcements.</p>

        <h1 id="privacy_5">Deletion of account authentication/passwords and data</h1>
        <p>In the event you delete your data from Spark, or revoke access to your data, or delete your Spark account, all your data, as well as your authentication/password information, is completely and permanently deleted from our servers, and we, therefore, do not have access to any of your data anymore.</p>
        <p>Also, you can delete your email account from Spark manually at any time using our&nbsp;<a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/account_deletion">Account Deletion page</a>.

        <ul>

            <li><span>We believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</span></li>
            <li><span>We transfer your information in the event a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding and you agree to and do hereby consent to our assignment or transfer of rights to your Personal Information.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="privacy_7">Confidentiality and Security</h1>
        <p>We limit access to Personal Information about you to employees, contractors and service providers who we believe reasonably need to have access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</p>
        <p>We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to comply with federal regulations to protect your Personal Information.</p>

    <p class="text">Readdle takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").</p>

    <h1 id="ip_privacy_1">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="text">This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect when you use our Spark mobile app product ("Spark") and what we do with this information. The information is used solely for purposes of providing better service to you. We do not loan, rent or sell information to others, other than as stated herein. This Privacy Policy applies only to our Spark app. Please see our general privacy policy that applies to our other products at&nbsp;<a href="https://readdle.com/privacy">readdle.com/privacy</a>.</p>
    <p class="text">We are committed to protect your privacy. We collect two types of information through the Spark app: General Statistical Information and Personal Information.</p>

    <h1 id="ip_privacy_2">General Statistical Information</h1>
    <p class="text">When you use the Spark app we gather statistics and analytics on your usage of Spark. We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the application-specific device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information, location, installed email, etc. This information is collectively referred to as "General Statistical Information". This data helps us to determine how different parts of the Spark app are used. This information is used by us to provide you with the best user experience possible.</p>
    <p class="text">We use third party services, such as Google Analytics, Facebook Analytics and Amplitude, to collect and analyze how you use Spark. These services may collect information about you and your usage of Spark in accordance with their respective privacy policies.</p>

    <h1 id="ip_privacy_3">Personal Information</h1>
    <p class="text">In addition to General Statistical Information we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. Information that can reasonably be used to identify you is referred to as "Personal Information". The first email you add to Spark is used as your username. We might use that email address to reach out to you periodically with information about features, updates, announcements or to request your feedback. All general email activity is mostly done on your device. Our servers are only involved for delivering the push notifications and, in some cases, for sending your email messages.</p>
    <p class="text">Accounts are added to Spark through OAuth where possible. Where OAuth is not supported we keep your account username and password on our secure servers. We then use the authorization provided to download your emails to our virtual servers and push to your device. We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure to store your data. Apart from the AWS' security policies we take a number of measures to ensure that your data is never read by anyone else. We ensure that all transmission is secured with HTTPS so that no one else can access your data. Your account credentials are stored on secure cloud-based servers using asymmetric encryption.</p>
    <p class="text">The safety and security of your information also depends on you. You should not share your email user name and password with anyone. If you find out that anyone has improperly obtained your login credentials and accesses your email account through Spark, you should immediately change your password. We are not responsible for such unauthorized access unless the access is our fault.</p>
    <p class="text">Primary function of Spark servers is to send push notifications and badge numbers to your device. To do that, Spark servers download email headers and text parts from your email service provider and use them to compose push notifications. We delete email headers and text as soon as push message has been prepared and sent. We store messages and emails in encrypted form on secure cloud-based servers.</p>
    <p class="text">When you delete your email account from Spark, we permanently delete your data and credentials from our servers after we get notification from the Spark app or from Apple Push Notifications Service. If you turn off Push Notifications for your email account on all devices we will delete it from our servers as well.</p>
    <p class="text">To provide you with synchronization of your email accounts and settings between different devices, we encrypt authorization information and user settings with unique encryption key stored in your iCloud account, out of our own reach, and sync it with other devices through our servers (we currently use Firebase for this purpose). We keep this information even after you deleted Spark from all your devices to allow you restore your accounts and settings quickly in case of application reinstall. However, since we don't have access to the encryption key, your data are completely secured.</p>
    <p class="text">We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personally identifiable information such as email address or name from children under the age of 13, we will promptly delete it. Parents and guardians can contact us on&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rdsupport@readdle.com">rdsupport@readdle.com</a>&nbsp;if they are aware that their child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent.</p>
    <p class="text">The support queries you write to us about might contain Personal Information. We use information in these queries solely to help you resolve the issues reported and improve the product quality.</p>

    <h1 id="ip_privacy_4">Use of Email Addresses</h1>
    <p class="text">When you start to use Spark we collect email address of the first email account you connected to the app. We use it as primary way to let you know about important Spark announcements and send you tips and tricks on getting most of the app. You can always opt-out of receiving email messages and newsletters from us.

    <p class="text">When you contact our customer support via email or using our online form your email will be retained in our customer support system. We may use this email to contact you later with updates about your request, with information about related features and other announcements.</p>

    <h1 id="ip_privacy_5">Deletion of account authentication/passwords and&nbsp;data</h1>
    <p class="text">In the event you delete your data from Spark, or revoke access to your data, or delete your Spark account, all your data, as well as your authentication/password information, is completely and permanently deleted from our servers, and we, therefore, do not have access to any of your data anymore.</p>

    <h1 id="ip_privacy_6">Use of Personal Information</h1>
    <p class="text">Readdle does not rent, sell, or share personally identifiable information about you with non-affiliated third parties (other than our subsidiaries and affiliates), except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</span></li>
        <li><span>We believe it is necessary to share personally identifiable information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Readdle's terms of use, this privacy policy, or as otherwise required by law.</span></li>
        <li><span>We believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</span></li>
        <li><span>We transfer your information in the event a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding and you agree to and do hereby consent to our assignment or transfer of rights to your Personal Information.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="ip_privacy_7">Confidentiality and Security</h1>
    <p class="text">We limit access to Personal Information about you to employees, contractors and service providers who we believe reasonably need have access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</p>
    <p class="text">We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to comply with federal regulations to protect your Personal Information.</p>

    <h1 id="ip_privacy_8">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="text">It is our policy to post any changes we make to our Privacy Policy on this page. Your continued use of the Spark app after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Privacy Policy (posted at&nbsp;<a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/privacy">sparkmailapp.com/privacy</a>) periodically for updates.</p>
