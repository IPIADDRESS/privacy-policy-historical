<p><b>Cookies.</b> To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Spacetime Applications use data "cookies."

<p><b>Web Beacons.</b> Our web pages contain "web beacons." Web beacons allow us to count users that have visited a web page or opened an email that contains a web beacon and collect other types of aggregate information. Using this information, we are able to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Spacetime Applications. This allows us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which parts of our Spacetime Applications are the most interesting and what kind of offers our registered users like to see. Some of the web beacons that are in place on our Spacetime Applications are used only by us, and other web beacons are from our vendors who use this data to assist us in analyzing how our Spacetime Applications are used. </p>
