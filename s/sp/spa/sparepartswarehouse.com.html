<p>This privacy policy statement discloses the privacy practices for <u><a webbot-href="--WEBBOT-HOME--" name="disabled">sparepartswarehouse.com</a></u>.
This privacy policy statement applies solely to information collected by <a webbot-href="--WEBBOT-HOME--" name="disabled">sparepartswarehouse.com</a>. It will notify you of the following:

  </li><li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
  </li><li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your
    information.
  </li><li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</b><br>
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have
access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other
direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
</p><p>We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you
contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of
our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship
an order.
</p><p>Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell
you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.</p>
<p><b>Your Access to and Control Over Information</b><br>
You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the

  </li><li>Express any concern you have about our use of your data.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Orders</b><br>
We request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must
provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial
information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used
for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an
order, we'll use this information to contact you.</p>
<p><b>Security</b><br>
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive
information via the website, your information is protected both online and
offline.
</p><p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that
information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify
this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or
looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
</p><p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online,
we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the
information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service)
are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers
in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure
environment.</p>

cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our
