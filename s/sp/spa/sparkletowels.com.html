<h3>Georgia-Pacific Privacy Notice</h3>
<br>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Notice details how we, Georgia-Pacific LLC and our subsidiaries, 
affiliates, and partners may collect, use, and share information about you as you use our Internet services.

<li>our mobile applications; and</li>

 </ul>
<p>The following sections summarize our practices. You may click the links in each section for a more complete 
description. Please also review our <a href="/legal/index.asp" target="_new">Terms of Use,</a> which govern 
your use of our Internet services. If there is a conflict between this Privacy Notice and terms or practices 
posted for a specific service, the additional terms or practices apply to your use of that service.</p><p>

<br>
</p><h3>Information we collect</h3>

<p>We collect information about you by several means, including:</p>

<li>by automated means, such as cookies and usage tracking; and</li>
<li>by obtaining information from third parties, such as data vendors.</li>
 </ul>

<p>We collect both personal information, that is, information that identifies you, and other information that is 
not connected to your identity.  Please click <a href="index.asp#howwecollect">here</a> for a more detailed 
description.</p>


<br>
<h3>How we use and share your information</h3>
<p>We use your information to communicate with you about our products, services, and promotions, including via 
online advertising, to get your feedback on our products and services, to manage and improve our business and 
our online presence, and for other purposes we describe in the Privacy Notice. We may share your information 
with certain service providers and marketing partners, if we are required to provide the data by law, or as 
part of the sale of any portion of our company. We do not share your personal information with third parties 
except as described in this Privacy Notice.  Please click <a href="index.asp#howweuse">here</a> for more information.</p>

<br>
<h3>Your choices</h3>
<p>We offer you certain choices about how we collect, use, and share information about you and how we 
communicate with you, including choices regarding:</p>

<ul class="ul">
 
<li>receiving marketing communications from Georgia-Pacific and our business partners;</li>
<li>sharing your information with certain third parties;</li>
<li>receiving online targeted advertising; and</li>
<li>sharing the geographic location details of your mobile device.</li>

 </ul>
<p>Please click <a href="index.asp#yourchoices">here</a> for more information.</p>  

<br><br>
<p class="big">Information Practices</p>
<a name="howwecollect"><h3>How We Collect Information</h3></a>

<p>We may collect information about you from various sources and by various means.  Specifically, we may obtain 
information about you: </p>

<ul class="UL">

<li>On our websites (e.g., when you submit requests for product information or product samples, sign up for 
business alerts, or participate in our online contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions)</li>
<li>When you contact us by email, phone, or other means</li>
<li>Through our social media pages and other features</li>
<li>When you use our mobile applications</li>
<li>When you choose to participate in third-party applications or features (such as one of our social networking 
presences or a similar application or feature on a third party website) through which you allow us to collect 
and share (or the third party to collect and share) information about you, including personal information</li>
<li>When other users of a third party website give us access to the information about you, 
for example if you are listed in another user's "connections"</li>
<li>From our parent, affiliate or subsidiary companies, and business partners</li>
<li>From other third parties, such as commercial data vendors, public databases, and other public and 
non-public sources</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the information you provide directly to us and the data we obtain from third parties, our Internet 
services use a variety of technologies to automatically collect the usage information described in the "Information We 
Collect" section below. We collect usage information through:</p>

<ul class="UL">

<li><i>Cookies.</i> Our websites may place "cookies" on your device and access these cookies during subsequent uses. Furthermore, 
our websites may allow third parties to place and access cookies on your device. Our websites may also identify cookies 
of third parties that are present on your computer. Cookies enable us and third parties to identify your specific 
device on subsequent visits to our sites and third party sites. By identifying returning visitors, we can obtain 
more precise usage data, provide customized versions of our sites, and store your preferences. Our sites may also set 
and access cookies that retain personal information, such as your login credentials for our sites.</li>

<li><i>Referrer headers.</i> We may record referrer headers when you follow links to our web services. A web browser 
sends a referrer header to a destination site when the user clicks on a link to that site. The header contains the 
Internet address or URL of the site linking to the destination site. The referrer header may provide information about 
your interaction with the linking site. For example, if you follow a link to one of our web services from a search 
engine, we may be able to determine and store the search query that you used to find our site. We use this information 
to improve our web services and increase their accessibility to search engines. We also use referrer information to 
monitor our advertising campaigns, as described more fully below.</li>

<li><i>Beacons and trackers.</i>  We may send you communications containing, and certain pages on our websites may 
contain, "web beacons" (also known as "Internet tags," "pixel tags," "tracking beacons," and "clear GIFs.") A web beacon 
is a small or invisible image included in a web page or email that allows the person hosting the beacon to determine 
when the page or email has been viewed. That person may also be able to set or access cookies on your device. Web 
beacons may also collect usage information.</li>

</ul>

<a name="informwecollect"><h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3></a>

<p>We may ask for, and you may choose to provide personal information that could be used to identify you as an 
individual.  We also may obtain personal information about you from third parties. Examples of personal information 
we may collect include:</p>

<ul class="ul">

<li>Your contact information (such as name, social media screen name, handle or other identifier, postal and email 
address, or telephone number)</li>
<li>Personal information you share pursuant to your social media privacy settings</li>
<li>Demographic information (such as age, date of birth and gender)</li>
<li>Location information, such as the real-time geographic location of the device you are using to access the 
Georgia-Pacific provided service, if you allow your device to provide it automatically </li>
<li>Payment details (including payment card number, security code, expiration date, cardholder name and billing address)</li>
<li>Contact information of friends or other people you like us to contact</li>
<li>Other details that you may submit to us or that may be included in the information provided to us 
by third parties</li>
</ul>

<p>We also collect usage information, that is, information about how our Internet services, such as websites, 
social media sites and mobile applications, are used and accessed, and information about the device you are 
using to access the service. This usage information may include:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>Pages you view, links you click, and selections you make, if the service is a website</li>
<li>Your browser's HTTP referrer header, in the case of a website</li>
<li>Features you use, preferences you set, and selections you make, if the service is provided through a mobile application</li>
<li>Your web browser type and version, if the service is a website</li>
<li>The operating system type and version of the device you are using to access the service</li>
<li>The Internet protocol (IP) address of the device you are using to access the Georgia-Pacific provided service</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also determine additional information about you from usage information, such as your general physical location 
or Internet service provider based on your Internet protocol address.</p>

<a name="howweuse"><h3>How We Use Your Information</h3></a>

<p>We may use the information we obtain about you to:</p>

<ul class="ul">

<li>Communicate with you about our products, services, offers, events and promotions, and offer you products and services 
we believe may be of interest to you; we may communicate with you via social media platforms, online advertising and by 
sending you email business alerts and newsletters</li>
<li>Provide customer support, including by responding to requests for information about our products and services 
(such as material safety information or inquiries about Encadria services) </li>
<li>Provide you with the specific services that you request</li>
<li>Manage your participation in our events, sweepstakes, and other promotions (including by sending e-Cards, sharing

as otherwise set forth in this notice, and in the following circumstances: </p>

<ul class="ul">
<li><i>Third party service providers.</i>  In order to carry out your requests, to make various features, services and 
materials available to you through the services, to respond to your inquiries, and for other purposes described in the 
"How We Use Your Information" section of this Privacy Notice, we may share your personal information or usage information

your information to an acquirer, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the acquirer to use your information in a 
manner that is consistent with this notice. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or 
against us, your information may be considered a company asset that may be sold or transferred to third parties. </li>

<li><i>Disclosures required by law.</i> We may transfer and disclose your information to third parties (i) to comply 
with a legal obligation, (ii) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, (iii) at the request of 
governmental authorities conducting an investigation, (iv) to verify or enforce our policies, (v) to respond to an 
emergency, or (vi) otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of third parties, users of our 
services or the public.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Online Advertising</h3>

<p>We license technology to serve advertisements on our services and within our content as it may appear elsewhere 
on the Internet. In addition, we may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements and third party 
analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about how our services are used and how our content 
is viewed. We do not share personal information with these third parties, but ad network providers, advertisers, 
sponsors, and analytics providers may set and access their own cookies, beacons and similar technologies on your 
device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including usage information. We and 
our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based 
on your visits to both our services and other Internet services. We may use a variety of companies to serve 
advertisements. You may configure your browser to reject cookies from our sites and cookies from third parties. 
However, rejecting cookies may affect your user experience and you may not be able to access certain features of 
our sites.</p>

<h3>User-Generated Content</h3>

<p>Some of our services and social networking features enable you to submit your own content for public posting. 
Information you post in this fashion becomes public information and is not subject to this Privacy Notice. We 
cannot control how others may use publicly-posted information.</p>

<a name="yourchoices"></a><h3>Your Choices</h3>

<p>We offer you certain choices about what information we collect from you, how we use and share the information, 
and how we communicate with you. We do not charge for opt out service. To help protect your privacy and 
security, we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID.</p>

<p>You may opt out of (i) sharing your personal information with third parties for those parties' own purposes, 
(ii) using your personal information to provide you with information or offers; and (iii) receiving newsletters, 
emails or other communications by clicking <a href="/contactus/generalInfo_pr.asp">here</a> or writing to:</p>

<p>Georgia-Pacific LLC<br>
Attention: Privacy Office<br>
P.O. Box 105605<br>
Atlanta, GA 30348<br>
USA<br>

</p><p>In addition, you have the following specific opt out choices:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li><i></i>Marketing communications. You may also opt out of specific communications (such as marketing email 
communication we send jointly with our business partners) by following the opt out instructions contained in the 
communication.  </li>
<li><i>Cookies.</i> Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you 
receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. However, rejecting cookies may affect your user 
experience and you may not be able to access certain features of our sites.  In addition, disabling cookies may 
invalidate opt outs that rely on cookies, such as web analytics or targeted advertising opt outs. </li>
<li><i>Targeted advertising.</i> If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network 
advertising programs that use your information. To do so please visit 
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="new">
the Network Advertising Initiative's ("NAI") Opt Out Page.</a>  Please note that even if you choose to opt out, you may still see 
advertisements while browsing, but the advertisements you see may be non-specific. Additionally, many network 
advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online 
browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. 
NAI opt out may not be effective for mobile applications. The NAI Opt Out Page provides a tool that identifies its 
member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.</li>
<li><i>Geographic location.</i> When you use our application on your mobile device, you may choose not to share your 
geo-location details with us by adjusting the device's location services settings. For instructions on changing the 
relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.</li>
</ul>

<p>While we will take all reasonable steps to honor your choices with respect to your personal information, you 
should be aware that it is not always possible to delete all of your information for technical reasons. For example, 
we may store personal information in long-term archives or backups or retain an identifier to honor your opt out 
choices. We will continue to send you service-related communications and we may need to keep the information we 
have collected about you for record keeping, analysis or other reasons, to the extent permitted by law. In 
addition, we may delete records containing personal information from time to time and we disclaim any liability 
arising out of, or related to, the deletion of personal information.</p>

<h3>Job Seekers</h3>

<p>We actively seek employment applications on our website and through third party job posting sites. We also use

corporate affiliates and parent. We will only use your application information to evaluate you for positions with our 
company and with our affiliates and parent and for contacting you about your candidacy. If you choose to provide 
optional information, such as your race or ethnic background, we will not use this optional information in evaluating 
your application.</p>
