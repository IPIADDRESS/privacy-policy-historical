<h2>Information We Collect by Automated Means&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>

<p>When you visit and interact with our websites and applications, we may collect "Other Information” that does not inherently reveal your specific identity, in order to learn how to best tailor our websites for our visitors.&nbsp; Examples of what Other Information we may collect and how we and third-party service providers may collect this information include:&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Aggregation Information</i></b> – Aggregated user information does not personally identify you or any other user (for example, we may aggregate user information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).&nbsp; Aggregated data is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>App Usage Data</i></b> – When you download and use an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.</p>

<p><b><i>Browser and Device Information </i></b>– Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your computer type, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the online services (such as the Apps) you are using.&nbsp; We use this information to ensure that the online services function properly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Cookies</i></b> –&nbsp; Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer or mobile device that you are using.&nbsp; Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the online services, pages visited, referring URL, and other aggregated website traffic data.&nbsp; We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to collect statistical information, and to personalize your experience while online.</p>

<p>Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the online services or to send you advertisements and marketing emails.&nbsp; We may also use cookies or other technologies to track responses to our online advertisements and marketing emails.&nbsp; You can opt out of such interest-based advertising using cookies set by participating NAI members at: http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/.&nbsp; Opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean you will no longer see advertising online. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opt out will no longer show ads that have been tailored to your interests.</p>

<p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser or, depending on your jurisdiction, by managing your tracking preferences as noted in a separately posted cookie statement or via a posted cookie manager.&nbsp; If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the online services.&nbsp; For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit. You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs.&nbsp; At this time, we do not respond to browser “Do-Not-Track” signals except in jurisdictions where we are required to do so by law.</p>

<p><b><i>IP Address</i></b> – Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).&nbsp; An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the online services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.&nbsp; We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering our online services.&nbsp; We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address to understand from what regions of the world our website visitors come.</p>

<p><b><i>Physical Location and Mobile Location-Based Services</i></b> – We may collect the physical location of your device if you have consented to us doing so, by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, Wi-Fi signals, or other technologies.&nbsp; We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.</p>

<p>If you have downloaded one of our Apps, you may enroll to receive offers by agreeing to the use of technologies that enable us to collect information about your location through your mobile device’s Bluetooth or similar capabilities.&nbsp; We will collect this information if you opt-in through the App (either during your initial login or later) to receive the offers and by enabling these capabilities on your mobile device.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Marketing Partners </i></b>–<i>&nbsp;</i>In some cases, we may permit certain network advertising companies and publishers to collect personal information on our sites.&nbsp; In addition, our business partners may access personal information about you that we have combined with such business partners’ data.

<h2>Automated Decisions About You&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We may make automated decisions about you using your personal information in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Automated processing may be used when evaluating large numbers of applicants for job vacancies. For these purposes we would request that you create a profile and answer some job-related questions to evaluate your skills as compared to the published job requirements.&nbsp; An algorithm may then be used to determine which candidates will be allowed to proceed to the next step within the selection process. We consider this data and process to be relevant because it will assist us to select the applicant most suitable for our vacancies.&nbsp; The outcome of the evaluation may have an impact on whether you are offered a role for the vacancy you apply to.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can contact us via the contact information provided in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy to request further information about automated decision-making, object to our use of automated decision-making, or request an automated decision to be reviewed by us if required by local law.&nbsp;</p>
