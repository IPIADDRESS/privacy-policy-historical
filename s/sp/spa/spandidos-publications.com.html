						<h1>Website Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>The said website is owned by Spandidos Publications and Spandidos Publications UK (hereinafter we, us, our), which act as Joint Controllers with regards to the personal data described below. The content of this website has the following aims: to allow access to scientific knowledge in the form of manuscripts published in specific journals, and to give you the opportunity, through its registration process, to submit and publish manuscripts, or to review manuscripts for publication. Both companies have defined the means and the purposes of the processing of your personal data, in order to offer you the aforementioned services.</p>
<p>We are the exclusive administrators of the website in discussion and are responsible for the processing of the personal data you submit, in accordance with the applicable General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679 - GDPR).</p>
<h2>1.	What is personal data?</h2>
<p>According to Article 4(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
<h2>2.	What personal data is collected and why?</h2>
<p>In case the users of the website voluntarily provide their personal data (e.g. name, address, telephone number or email address), we shall process them for the purposes mentioned below. Users may decline to provide personal information; however, in this case, we may be unable to deliver the services requested.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration:underline">2.1	For the purpose of your registration</h3>
<p>Users are requested to provide the following personal details for registration on the website:

<li>Position</li>
<li>Postal address</li>
<li>Username &amp; login password</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>You may also provide your mobile phone number on an optional basis.</p> <p>Website registration is required before a manuscript can be submitted, subscriptions can be made, or newsletters received. The information is used to provide the service requested and to ensure standards of scientific integrity.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration:underline">2.2	For the purpose of the submission and publication of a manuscript</h3>

</p><ul>
<li>Email address of first and corresponding authors</li>
<li>Postal address of first and corresponding authors</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>These details are used to facilitate scientific communication. Visitors of the website and subscribers to our journals can access this information. Our journals are also abstracted and indexed in various databases (see the page for each journal for specific details).</p>
<p>During the manuscript submission process, the authors are requested to suggest five (5) reviewers. In this case, we also process the name, email address, title, position and company/institution of the suggested reviewer. The authors are bound to inform the natural persons they suggest as reviewers about this process before they submit their personal data to us.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration:underline">2.3 For the purpose of the submission of a CV</h3>
<p>When a CV is submitted via the website as part of an application for a job with us, the information included in it is used to assess suitability for the role and will be used to contact you regarding the status of your application. In this case, the personal data we receive refers to employment and background data, which you knowingly disclose to us.</p>

<h3 style="text-decoration:underline">2.6 General</h3>
<p>Payment for publication is carried out via bank transfer or credit card, using a third party; therefore, no payment information is processed by us.</p>

<h2>5.	Security</h2>
<p>The information we collect is kept secure via the use of administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect it from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or alteration. We use SSL Certificates to enhance the security of our website and web services.</p>

<p>The recipients of your data may be <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mailgun.com/privacy-policy">Mailgun Technologies</a>, Inc., which is assigned with distributing our newsletters.

<li>We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission (standard contractual clauses) to legally bind the processor of your personal data;</li>
<li>We may transfer data to US-based companies if they are part of the Privacy Shield;</li>
<li>We are provided with your consent for certain transfers, after informing you of the possible risks of such transfers due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards;</li>

</ul>
