			<h3>The information we collect from you</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>We collect the information you provide to us when you register on the site, including your name, gender, email address and search preferences. We use this information to create a user account for you on our site and to provide our services to you, including publishing your adverts on the site and facilitating introductions with other members of our site. However, we will not share your email address with other users of the site unless you have specifically chosen to disclose it. Where you have not opted out of receiving them, we will also use this information to send you email notifications of other users’ adverts matching your search preferences and/or newsletters about our own services we think may be of interest to you from time to time. We will not sell or rent any of this information to any third parties nor send you any third party marketing communications unless you have specifically opted in to receiving them.</li>
				<li>Any information you include in any advert you place on our site will be collected by us and stored on our servers for the purposes of making the website, and the content contained within it, available to our users, and to enable our users to search for and respond to adverts on the site. In the event you are asked to submit any sensitive personal data as part of the process for posting adverts on the site you’ll be asked to tick a box to demonstrate your consent to our collecting and storing that information and to us making that information available to other users through the site. We may also collect information from adverts posted to the site on an aggregated basis for statistical analysis. Some of this data may be used in press releases or shared with third parties on an aggregated basis. However, no individual will ever be identifiable from such data. We don’t collect, store or use any personal information contained in any such posts for any other purpose not set out in this privacy policy. Please note that any materials or information you post to our website will be visible to other users of the site. We therefore advise you to be selective about what information you include in your adverts and not to include any information you aren’t happy to be publically available.</li>
				<li>We may collect any information contained in correspondence between you and us. For example, if you contact us we may keep a record of that correspondence. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our website or any content or services made available through it.</li>
				<li>We may also collect and store any information contained in communications between yourself and other users on the site, where such communications have taken place via our on-site messaging system. We do not routinely monitor all communications but we may use software to track communications and we reserve the right to monitor them in order to investigate any suspected breach of our terms and conditions, illegal behaviour or any other misuse of our service or for any other reasonable reason as determined by us from time to time.</li>
				<li>We may also collect certain information about your visits to our website and how you use it. This may include your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit, number of page views and similar information. We may use this information for a number of purposes, <strong>including website administration, optimising the use and performance of the website, disclosing to third party contributors or for security purposes.</strong> Individual users will not be identifiable from this information. This information may be collected by a third party website analytics service provider on our behalf and may be collected using cookies. For more information on our use of cookies please refer to section 5 below.</li>
				<li>We may also collect other information about your activity on the site that is specific to your user account, such as your search history, your search and account preferences and adverts you have posted. We use this information to improve your site experience and to send you content and messages that are relevant to you. We may use cookies to collect this information.</li>
				<li>In some instances, we may receive some information that you submit to any third party website you access from a link contained in our website, or where you have logged into our website using your profile and account details of a third party website, such as Facebook. Both we and the owner or operator of that third party website will be the data controller in respect of any such information. You should check the privacy policy of those third party websites to find out how they will use your data.</li>
				<li>If you choose to register and log in to our site using your Facebook profile you are agreeing to share some of the information contained in your Facebook profile with us, such as your friends list, your education and work history, your email address and your interests. We may use this information to improve your user experience on the site and to match you with other users of the site who you are already friends with on Facebook, or who have similar interests or histories to you.</li>

						<li>any person to whom disclosure is necessary to enable us to enforce our legal rights, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Flatshare Ltd or our customers or employees or where such disclosure may be required by law; and/or</li>
						<li>any acquirer or potential acquirer of all, or substantially all, of the share capital or assets of Flatshare Limited.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>You should note that the public elements of the website, including any adverts you post on the site, will be visible to other users of the website anywhere in the world.

			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<ol>
			 	<li>In common with other websites we use cookies to ensure that you get the most out of the site and to improve the service we offer. A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to your device when you access a website. The text file is then sent back to the server each time your browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser you are using.</li>
			 	<li>Some cookies we use are necessary for our website to function properly and to enable you to move around the site and use its features. In addition we also use so called "functional" cookies, which allow our website to remember choices you’ve made in relation to the website, so as to provide a more personalised and enhanced user experience. Examples of the functional cookies we use on the site, and the information we collect through the use of those cookies, include those that remember details about your account preferences, including your password and login details, your search history and adverts you have posted to the site, the types of alerts and newsletters you have opted to receive and the types of adverts you are interested in hearing about.</li>
			 	<li>As mentioned above, we may also use an analytics service provider, such as Google Analytics, for website traffic analysis and reporting. Analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies that are stored on users' computers. The information generated relating to the website may be used to create reports about the use of the website - the analytics service provider will store this information. Individual users will not be identifiable from this information.</li>
			 	<li>In addition, we are also using the following types of cookies on the site:
				 	<dl>
				 		<dt>Google AdWords</dt>
				 		<dd>Using Google AdWords code, we are able to see which pages helped lead to registering and, where applicable, upgrading. This allows us to make better use of our paid search budget on Google.. You can also choose to opt-out of AdWords remarketing <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</dd>
				 		<dt>DoubleClick</dt>
				 		<dd>We use Google Analytics remarketing codes to log when users view specific pages or take specific actions on the website. This allows us to provide targeted advertising in the future when you browse other websites.</dd>
				 		<dt>Visual DNA</dt>
						<dd>We use a VisualDNA tag to anonymously collect information about users' browsing activity on our website (this does not include names, addresses or any other personal information). This information is linked to a cookie that VisualDNA sets in your browser. This information allows us and VisualDNA to build a profile so that your online experience can be made more relevant to your specific interests. You have the right to opt out from VisualDNA's service by <a href="http://my.visualdna.com/" title="visualDNA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">clicking here</a> and choosing the ‘Cookie Settings’ option.
