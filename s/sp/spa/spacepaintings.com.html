Channel21 Productions, Inc. Online Privacy Policy</b>
</font><br><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
<font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica">
The policies below are applicable to the above-named online services 
(collectively the "Service") produced and maintained by Channel21 Productions, Inc. ("Channel21").
</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica">
Channel21 collects personally identifying information only during (i) web page signup 
and (ii) subscription registration.  In addition, information is 
collected in certain portions of the Service in which guests specifically 
and knowingly provide such information along with content submissions, 
community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or 
voting.  Channel21 may use such information for its internal purposes, 
including but not limited to editorial and feedback purposes.  In the 
event Channel21 plans to publicly post any such information on a site, 
guests are provided prior notification of such posting.
</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica">
Information submitted at the time of registration or submission may be 
used for marketing and promotional purposes by Channel21 and may be shared 
with companies that have been pre-screened by Channel21.  If a guest objects 
to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail 
request or by modifying his/her registration information online.
</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica">
<b>Cookies</b> are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an 
individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes while at the site.  
Cookies make Web-surfing easier by, among other things, saving your 
passwords, purchases, and preferences for you. The use of cookies is an 
industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites.
</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica">
Cookies help make Channel21 better, by showing how and when guests use the 
site.  Many content improvements and updates are based on such data as 
total number of visitors and pages viewed.  This information is most 
easily tracked with cookies.
</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica">
Here are some other examples of how Channel21 uses cookies:
<br>
</font></p><ul><font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica">
<li>A cookie lets the Service remember that you've registered, which 
allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites.
</li><li>Similarly, if there are any stores within the Service, a temporary 
cookie tracks which products you've selected while shopping.  The cookie 
expires once you're done shopping.  Letting it do the record-keeping 
saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again during 
a single visit.  If you decline this cookie, you may have difficulty 
ordering your selections.
</li></font></ul><font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica">
The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information 
although it may enable Channel21 to relate a user's use of the Service to 
personally identifying information that has previously been submitted by 
the user, if any.
<p>
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers.  These cookies 
are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such third parties'
 policies.
</p><p>
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  If you'd prefer, you 
can set yours to refuse cookies. However, it is likely that most areas 
of the site will not function properly if you do so.
</p><p>
Channel21 reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying 
guests, through a notice posted on the Service or by email, of the 
existence of a new privacy policy or any updates.
