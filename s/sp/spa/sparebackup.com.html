						Spare Backup Inc. ("SBI") is committed to protecting your privacy in handling personally identifiable 
						information relating to you, your transactions with us, and the Services you use from us. This Privacy 
						Statement describes the personally identifiable information we gather about you, what we do with it, 
						the safeguards we have in place to protect it, and how you can control our use of it. </span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="legalsubtitle">What personally identifiable information does Spare Backup Inc. request?</span><br>
						<span class="legaltext">SBI collects personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register 
						on our Web site, complete an order to purchase, sign up for a user name and password to use one of our 
						services, call us by telephone or send us a letter or email. This personally identifiable information 
						may include your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, fax number, credit card number 
						and expiration date, and other optional demographic information. In addition, when you choose to purchase 
						our services via our Web site, this information is used to verify your credit card information. You may 
						browse our Web site without supplying any personally identifiable information, but we will need to 
						collect personally identifiable information to process your orders or to send you offers or information 
						that you request.</span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="legalsubtitle">Does Spare Backup Inc. use "cookies"?</span><br>
						<span class="legaltext">
						In order for you to use our Web site, your computer must accept the use of cookies. A cookie is a small 
						data file that is stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable 
						information and do not give us control over your computer. We use cookies to identify you when you 
						return to our Web site so we can make the user experience more enjoyable, and to track your activity 
						on our Web site. We also use cookie data when you have expressly requested to use our "Auto Login" 
						feature, which automatically accesses user ID and password information and automatically logs you into 
						our products and services. </span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="legalsubtitle">How does Spare Backup Inc. use personally identifiable information about you? </span><br>
						<span class="legaltext">
						The personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us will be used to process your 
						orders, and may be used to identify you within our systems. We may use your email address to contact 
						you if we have questions about your order or service. We may also use your email address to notify you 
						about new services or special promotional programs, or to send you offers or information. Spare Backup 
						Inc. will not disclose personally identifiable information about you to others except as disclosed in 
						this Privacy Statement or as specifically authorized by you at the time the information is collected. 
						We contract with third parties to provide specific products or services to you. For example, we use a 
						credit card company to process credit card applications, issue credit, verify, bill, and collect payments 
						when you make a purchase with a credit card; an outside shipping company to ship orders if applicable; 
						outside direct mail and catalog vendors to provide customers with product and sales information; or to 
						send emails to customers and prospective customers. These service providers are provided with only the 
						information that they need to perform their functions and are required to agree not to use or disclose 
						your personally identifiable information for other purposes without your authorization. We may also share 
						your personally identifiable information within the Spare Backup Inc. family of businesses. If we enter 
						into marketing relationships with advertisers or other companies that provide products or services that 
						we believe may be of interest to Spare Backup Inc. customers, we may share non-identifiable aggregated 
						information with these companies, and, in addition, we may provide them with mailing address information 
						so that they may extend offers to you. However, we will not disclose your email address, telephone number, 
						or credit card account information without your consent. To make online shopping more convenient for you, 
						our Web site may provide access to other companies' Web sites or co-branded Web sites that may be designed 
						to look similar to our Web site; these sites are fully operated by the other company. If you request 
						additional information or order products or services from one of the companies featured on our Web site, 
						that company may provide us with the information you have given to them (except in the case of credit 
						application information, financial background or health information, which we do not receive from such 
						featured companies). We are not responsible for the content appearing on these companies' Web sites or for 
						the privacy practices of these companies. We encourage you to read the privacy policy on the other company's 
						Web site if you have any concerns about how information may be collected or used. If you make a purchase or 
						request a service from a featured company that you access through a frame on our Web site, information 
						relating to that transaction will be available to us as well as the featured company. We may use third-party 
						advertising technology to serve ads when you visit our site and sites upon which we advertise. This technology 
						uses information about your visits to the Spare Backup Inc. Web site and the sites upon which we advertise, 
						(not including your name, address, or other personal information), to serve our ads to you. In the course of 
						serving our advertisements to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. 
						In addition, we may use Web beacons, provided by our ad serving partner, to help manage our online advertising. 
						These Web beacons enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site and to 
						learn which banner ads bring users to our site. This information we collect and share through this technology 
						is not personally identifiable. We may share personally identifiable information with law enforcement or other 
						entities as required by law or as we reasonably determine to be necessary to protect our rights or the rights 
						of others, to prevent harm to persons or property, to fight fraud, or to enforce our Web site terms and 
						conditions. Personally identifiable information may be transferred as an asset in connection with a merger or 
						sale (including any transfers made as part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part 
						of our businesses. </span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="legalsubtitle">Does Spare Backup Inc. conduct special programs that use personally identifiable information?</span><br>
						<span class="legaltext">
						We occasionally conduct surveys, contests, or other promotional programs that involve the collection of personally 
						identifiable information, and we may send promotional emails to such participants from time to time. Participation 
						in these programs is completely voluntary, so that you have a choice whether to disclose the requested information 
						without limiting your ability to place orders for products and services. Information requested may include contact 
						information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as gender, zip code, or age). 
						Contact information will be used to notify participants of the outcome of such promotions. Survey information may 
						be used or disclosed for purposes of monitoring or improving the performance of our retail, catalog, or Web site 
						operations. We generally do not collect information through our Web site from children under age 13. If we conduct 
						a special online program that is open to children, children under age 13 will be permitted to participate only with 
						the consent of a parent or guardian or will otherwise be given the opportunity to participate without the need to 
						provide personally identifying information. </span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="legalsubtitle">How is my personally identifiable information protected? </span><br>
						<span class="legaltext">
						We have implemented numerous safeguards designed to protect personally identifiable information, however, no system 
						of security is impenetrable. Our databases are protected by physical, technical, and procedural measures that 
						restrict information access to authorized persons in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Our information 
						systems are maintained behind a secure firewall to isolate them from access by other networks connected to the 
						Internet. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally 
						identifiable information. When personally identifiable information is collected through our Web site, the transmission 
						is encrypted using industry-standard Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology, and sensitive information such as credit 
						card numbers or account information is encrypted for further protection. Our Web site is a "Secure Site" recognized 
						by VeriSign®, a leading computer network security company. You also play a valuable part in security. Your password, 
						user id and data encryption keys to access our Web site and/or our Services should never be shared with anyone and 
						should be changed frequently. After you have finished using our Web site, you should log out and exit your browser 
						to prevent unauthorized users from returning. If you believe that someone has improperly used personally identifiable 
						information about you or has made purchases that you did not authorize, please contact us immediately. </span>
						<br><br>
						<span class="legalsubtitle">How can I limit the use and sharing of personally identifiable information about me? </span><br>
						<span class="legaltext">
						You may decline to receive promotional email from us. Every promotional email we send contains instructions and an 
						Internet link to opt out of future email promotions. You may also opt out of promotional emails by sending an 
						email request to sales@spareswitch.com or by calling us at 888-24-SPARE. We reserve the right to change our data 
						practices from time to time. The current Privacy Statement will always be posted online at our Web site. If we 
						revise our Privacy Statement, you may decline to permit us to use your personally identifiable information under the 
						new policy by notifying us as described above. </span>
