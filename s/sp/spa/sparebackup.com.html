                                    <h1>Spare Backup Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Spare Backup Inc and our affiliates ("Spare Backup", "SBI" "we", "us", "our") respect
your right to privacy and we have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to
explain what information may be collected through this website ("Site"), and through the
use of our products and/or services (collectively "Offerings") how such information may
be used and/or shared with others, how we safeguard it and how you may access and
control its use in connection with our marketing communications and activities. Please
read this Privacy Policy carefully, because by using this Site and/or our Offerings, you
are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p><h2>Information We Collect</h2><p>
When you visit this Site and/or use our Offerings, we may collect certain types of
information from you, such as information that you provide voluntarily via forms,
surveys, applications and through the use of various Offerings or participation in various
Spare Backup programs. We may also collect information about you from your online
browsing and transactions, including your preferences, pages visited, technical
information regarding your computer and operating systems.
</p><h2>Information You Provide</h2><p>
In certain circumstances, you may be asked to provide us with some specific
information about yourself in order to use certain features on this Site and/or the
Offerings or to take advantage of certain opportunities that we may offer through this
Site and/or the Offerings. For example, we may collect personal contact, billing and
credit information when you register, sign up for our Offerings. Please note that the
Spare Backup online store may be administered by a third-party E-commerce service
provider and the online store privacy policy may differ from this Privacy Policy but the
relevant privacy policy will be posted as a link on the online store. We may also collect
personally identifiable information in connection with the return of products, warranty
and product registration, when you call or email our customer service representatives,
enter information on our Site, submit survey responses, participate in promotions,
sweepstakes or contests or for the purposes of receiving information about our
Offerings and promotions. The foregoing is more fully described below 
</p><h2>Information Collected Automatically</h2><p>
We collect certain information automatically, some of which may be associated with
personally identifiable information, whenever you use our Offerings or Site. For
example, when your computer web browser or other communication device (including
phone, PDA, etc.) accesses our Site, we receive certain information automatically, such
as your IP address, browser type, date and time and the web page you visited before
visiting our Site. This statistical data provides us with information about the use of this
Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on this Site, how long they stay on
that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. We collect this information
through the use of technologies such as "cookies" and "IP addresses", which are
discussed in greater detail below. We collect this information in order to determine
which areas of this Site are most popular and to enhance this Site for visitors.</p>
<p>From time to time we may also collect general, statistical information about information
and data stored and shared through the "Network Attached Storage" features of our
Offerings and the Offerings we provide to support "Network Attached Storage" features
("Web Service"). We also collect aggregate metadata concerning your files. We will use
this aggregate data to provide you with our Offerings improve our Offerings and improve
our general marketing efforts related to the Offerings. We may group this information
into aggregate data in order to describe the use of this Site and/or our Offerings to our
existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers or other third parties, or in
response to a government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate
data will in no way personally identify you or any other individuals.</p>
<h3><b>IP Addresses</b></h3>
<p>An IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer when it accesses the
Internet or another computer network. Web servers and network devices identify
your computer automatically by its IP address. We collect IP addresses for purposes
of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to
track the use of this Site. When a visitor requests pages from this Site, our servers
log the visitor's IP address. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything
personally identifiable, which means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the
visitor remains anonymous to us. However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses
to identify a visitor only when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with this
Site's policies or to protect our services, members, this Site or others.</p>
<h3><strong>Cookies</strong> </h3>
<p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a device accessing the
Internet. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies on our Site or
the pages we use to deliver our Offerings to you. A session ID cookie expires when
you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your device for an extended
period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in
your Internet browser's "help" file. You can learn more about cookies at
allaboutcookies.org.</p>
<p>On our Site, we use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site by
saving your preferences and to improve and track the overall Site experience. For
our Site, we set a persistent cookie to determine your language and country so we
can provide you with relevant content. If you reject cookies, you may still use our
Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site may be limited. Please see the
Section "Advertising" to learn more about cookies placed on this Site and third party
websites.</p>

identifiable data. For many cookies, you may disable our placement of cookies on
your device.</p>

device and/or account that you choose to backup such as your contacts, email
addresses, calendar, memo, tasks, display pictures, status messages, media files and
other on-device information may be sent to Spare Backup or Spare Backup service
providers. Spare Backup or Spare Backup service providers may store this information
for you and may use this information in order to facilitate or improve the use, remote
access and restoration of that data on your device through the Offerings provided.

are companies or individuals that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our
partners), such as companies or individuals who analyze data, provide customer service
or other Offerings, advertisers, sponsors or other third parties who participate in or
administer our promotions or provide marketing or promotional assistance (but such
information will be shared only to the extent they need such information to perform their
functions). Your personally identifiable information may also be used by us or shared
with our subsidiaries, affiliates, sponsors, partners, advertisers or other third parties to
provide you with product information and promotional and other offers.
Some of the aggregate or personally identifiable information that Spare Backup receives
is collected through third party service offerings that are available through our Offerings.
In these cases the third party service provider will require you to sign up for the
applicable service offering and will include a link to the relevant privacy policy that
applies to such collection (i.e. this Spare Backup Privacy Policy or the third party's
privacy policy).</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable
information if we are required to do so by law or if we reasonably believe that such
action is necessary in order to: (a) fulfil a government request; (b) conform to the
requirements of the law or comply with any legal process served on us; (c) protect or
defend our legal rights or property, this Site or our Offerings, or its users; or (d) in an
emergency, protect the health and safety of this Site's users or the general public.
Except as provided herein, you're personally identifiable information will not be provided
to any third parties without prior approval from you.</p>
<p>As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another
entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, or assets related to this Site
and/or the Offerings, personally identifiable information, non-personally identifiable
information, and any other information that we have collected about the users of this
Site and/or our Offerings will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred 
assets. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us,
all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or
transferred to third parties.

You may always direct us not to share your personally identifiable information with third
parties, not to use your personally identifiable information to provide you with
information or offers, or not to send you newsletters, emails or other communications
by: (i) sending us an email at webmaster@SpareBackup.com;
(ii) contacting us by post at Spare Backup Inc.,382 NE 191st Street #58973 Miami Florida 33179 U.S.A,

that you receive. Your opt-out request will be processed within 30 business days of the
date on which we receive it.</p>

efforts to provide you with access to your personally identifiable information and either
to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not
otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask
individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed,
corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process
requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate
technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or
for which access is not otherwise required.
</p><h2>Advertising</h2><p>
Spare Backup advertises on pages within the Site as well as on other websites not
affiliated with Spare Backup. We contract with advertising service providers who serve
advertising to you through the use of technologies, such as cookies and web beacons.
Web beacons are small graphic images on a web page or on an HTML email that tell
our advertising service providers the Internet address of the Site pages viewed by
users, browsing patterns within the Site, and responses to advertisements and
promotions on the Site.
</p><h2>Behavioral Information/Targeted Marketing </h2><p>
We also use advertising service providers to help us determine which of our
advertisements are most likely to be of interest to you while you are on the Site. These
advertising service providers may use anonymous behavioral information, such as how
you navigate the site, to provide relevant advertisements to you while you are on Spare
Backup websites. These advertising service providers do not have access to, or collect,
personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, account
number or telephone number.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to have anonymous behavioral information used in this way, set your
browser to not accept cookies, but doing so may cause you to experience some
inconvenience in your use of the Site, as described above.
</p><h2>Advertising on Other Websites</h2><p>
Spare Backup contracts with advertising companies to advertise our accounts and
Offerings on websites not affiliated with Spare Backup. If you click on one of our ads,
you link to the third party website that offers the advertised account or Offerings. These
ads may contain cookies that allow tracking of your response to our advertisements.
These cookies do not identify you personally.
Spare Backup's advertising service providers, such as Google, Yahoo! or
MSN/Microsoft, may offer a way to opt out of targeted advertising based on the use of
their cookies.</p>
<p><b>In addition, if you prefer that our advertising service providers not know
which Spare Backup website pages you have viewed, visit the Network Advertising
Initiative site: http://www.networkadvertising.org to opt out of ad targeting from
participating companies.</b>In order for the opt-outs to work on your computer, your
browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new computer,
access the Site from a different computer, log in under a different screen name, or
change web browsers, you will need to opt out again. If your browser has scripting
disabled, you do not need to opt out, as behavioral marketing technology does not work
when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate
whether scripting is active or disabled.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you prefer not to have anonymous behavioral information used in this
way, set your browser to not accept cookies, but doing so may cause you to experience
some inconvenience in your use of the Site.
</p><h2>Children Under 13 </h2><p>
This Site and our Offerings are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly
collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we
become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information
from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such
information from our records.
</p><h2>Keeping Your Information Secure</h2><p>
We have reasonable security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and
alteration of the information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while
we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot
guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us
online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of
your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>If you have registered on this Site, for our Offerings or are a member of the Spare
Backup Partner Program, access to your account will be protected by your password.
We recommend that you do not disclose your password to any other person. You are
solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and
are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.
</p><h2>Additional Information Regarding Network Attached Storage</h2><p>
Our Network Attached Storage feature enables you to share files from your storage
device over the Internet only with people authorized by you. Authorized users have
access only to those files you specifically designate. Although the "Network Attached
Storage" feature is designed so that no one can access your files over the Internet
without your permission, Spare Backup cannot guarantee or warrant that others will not
be able to access your files.</p>
<p>You connect with our servers during sign-in. After you have successfully signed in, you
can view and download files that you have enabled for web access or that have been
shared with you by others.</p>
<p>We give you the option of creating private, password-protected folders and files on your
storage device. Except as stated below, your files are stored only on your storage
device, not on our servers, The "Network Attached Storage" feature is designed so that
only you and the people with whom you choose to share your files ever see your data.
Bear in mind that any files or pictures you share using the storage device can be saved 
and forwarded by the people with whom you share them. We do not keep records of
your files on our servers, nor do we track the sharing activity of your files.</p>
<p>We may store the file directory of your storage device on our servers. You use this
directory to navigate and select the files you want to view or download when you are
away from your storage device. When you download a file from the Web Service, you
are pulling the file directly from your personal server, not from our servers. We may also
store some directory names (but not file names) in our secure data center in order to
provide persistent share information and descriptions to your recipients. The storage
device service times out signed-in users automatically after a period of inactivity.</p>
<p>If we suspect that your account has been compromised or is being used suspiciously,
we will deactivate the account and notify you.Notify us immediately by sending an email
to webmaster@SpareBackup.com if you think your account has been compromised.</p>
<p>All data transmissions between your storage device and your authorized web users are
protected by 128-bit SSL encryption. Our service hardware is housed in a secure,
access-controlled data center where each access is logged. Only authorized employees
with a need for access are granted access.
</p><h2>Other Sites and Third Party Offerings</h2><p>
This Site may contain links to other websites that we do not control or maintain. We
encourage you to note when you leave this Site and to read the privacy statements of
such other websites before submitting any personally identifiable information.
Additionally, if you access a third party branded service through an API or otherwise,
you are solely responsible for understanding, agreeing to and complying with the third
party service terms and conditions of use and privacy policy. Spare Backup is not
responsible for the privacy policies or security of third party websites and/or services.
</p><h2>International Processing and Transfer of Data</h2><p>
Given that we are an international business, our use of your information necessarily
involves the transmission and processing of data on an international basis (including in
and to the United States and countries other than the country where the data was
collected from you, which may not have data protection laws as stringent as those that
exist in your country of residence). By using this Site and/or the Offerings, or providing
personally identifiable information to Spare Backup you consent to the collection,
processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States 
and other applicable territories outside of the country where the data was collected from
you.

</p><h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2><p>
Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature and/or as required by law or regulatory
change, Spare Backup may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so,
Spare Backup will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site along with a change
notice on the Site. Spare Backup may also send registered users of our Offerings a
notice that this Privacy Policy has been changed. Spare Backup encourages you to
review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this Site
and/or our Offerings and/or your continued provision of personally identifiable
information to us after the posting of such notice will be subject to the terms of the then-
current Privacy Policy.</p>

				</p><p><b>Service Fees:</b> SBI may offer certain Services free of charge during promotional offerings and during some initial trial period.

Visit www.sparebackup.com for more information about the Services, subscription plans and pricing information.</p>
				<p><b>Non-Commercial Use:</b> If you choose a plan requiring non-commercial use of the service, you may not resell, wholesale, sublease or otherwise use the service to generate revenue from SBI's backup and restore service, without the prior written consent of SBI.

				<p><b>Monthly Plan:</b> If you choose a monthly plan, you acknowledge that your subscription and fees are collected on a monthly basis in advance. Your subscription will automatically be renewed at the current monthly pricing plan and your credit card will be billed by SBI in advance for the next month of service unless another plan is selected or you cancel your subscription prior to the beginning of the next billing cycle. In the event that you cancel or terminate the Services, any time after subscribing, SBI at its own discretion will determine if a refund is provided. Refunds are limited to the cost of one month's service.</p>
				<p><b>Annual Plan:</b> If you choose an annual plan, you acknowledge that your subscription covers a twelve (12) month term in which SBI will charge your credit card for the full amount of the discounted annual plan. At the end of your term, your subscription will automatically be renewed for another twelve (12) month term at the then-current annual pricing plan, and your credit card will be charged by SBI for the new twelve (12) month term unless another plan is selected or you cancel your subscription prior to the beginning of the next billing cycle. In the event that you cancel or terminate the Services anytime during a twelve (12) month term, you acknowledge and agree that any remaining balance will be forfeited and no refund will be provided.

If you terminate in the middle of your subscription term, SBI will not be required to refund the pro rata difference in the amount of service paid for and used. If your credit card is declined for any reason, you commit fraud or engage in any other dishonest conduct, or if you dispute or refuse to pay a SBI charge for any reason, such matters will be considered a material breach of these Terms and Conditions, and SBI may terminate your account immediately, without notice or liability to you.</p>
				<p><b>Promotional Plans:</b> If you subscribe for a promotional plan you acknowledge that your subscription and fees are on based on the current promotional plan you have selected.

				<h1>Spare Backup Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p>Spare Backup Inc and our affiliates ("Spare Backup", "SBI" "we", "us", "our") respect
				your right to privacy and we have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to
				explain what information may be collected through this website ("Site"), and through the
				use of our products and/or services (collectively "Offerings") how such information may
				be used and/or shared with others, how we safeguard it and how you may access and
				control its use in connection with our marketing communications and activities. Please
				read this Privacy Policy carefully, because by using this Site and/or our Offerings, you
				are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
				</p><h2>Information We Collect</h2><p>
				When you visit this Site and/or use our Offerings, we may collect certain types of
				information from you, such as information that you provide voluntarily via forms,
				surveys, applications and through the use of various Offerings or participation in various
				Spare Backup programs. We may also collect information about you from your online
				browsing and transactions, including your preferences, pages visited, technical
				information regarding your computer and operating systems.
				</p><h2>Information You Provide</h2><p>
				In certain circumstances, you may be asked to provide us with some specific
				information about yourself in order to use certain features on this Site and/or the
				Offerings or to take advantage of certain opportunities that we may offer through this
				Site and/or the Offerings. For example, we may collect personal contact, billing and
				credit information when you register, sign up for our Offerings. Please note that the
				Spare Backup online store may be administered by a third-party E-commerce service
				provider and the online store privacy policy may differ from this Privacy Policy but the
				relevant privacy policy will be posted as a link on the online store. We may also collect
				personally identifiable information in connection with the return of products, warranty
				and product registration, when you call or email our customer service representatives,
				enter information on our Site, submit survey responses, participate in promotions,
				sweepstakes or contests or for the purposes of receiving information about our
				Offerings and promotions. The foregoing is more fully described below 
				</p><h2>Information Collected Automatically</h2><p>
				We collect certain information automatically, some of which may be associated with
				personally identifiable information, whenever you use our Offerings or Site. For
				example, when your computer web browser or other communication device (including
				phone, PDA, etc.) accesses our Site, we receive certain information automatically, such
				as your IP address, browser type, date and time and the web page you visited before
				visiting our Site. This statistical data provides us with information about the use of this
				Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on this Site, how long they stay on
				that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. We collect this information
				through the use of technologies such as "cookies" and "IP addresses", which are
				discussed in greater detail below. We collect this information in order to determine
				which areas of this Site are most popular and to enhance this Site for visitors.</p>
				<p>From time to time we may also collect general, statistical information about information
				and data stored and shared through the "Network Attached Storage" features of our
				Offerings and the Offerings we provide to support "Network Attached Storage" features
				("Web Service"). We also collect aggregate metadata concerning your files. We will use
				this aggregate data to provide you with our Offerings improve our Offerings and improve
				our general marketing efforts related to the Offerings. We may group this information
				into aggregate data in order to describe the use of this Site and/or our Offerings to our
				existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers or other third parties, or in
				response to a government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate
				data will in no way personally identify you or any other individuals.</p>
				<h3><b>IP Addresses</b></h3>
				<p>An IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer when it accesses the
				Internet or another computer network. Web servers and network devices identify
				your computer automatically by its IP address. We collect IP addresses for purposes
				of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to
				track the use of this Site. When a visitor requests pages from this Site, our servers
				log the visitor's IP address. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything
				personally identifiable, which means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the
				visitor remains anonymous to us. However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses
				to identify a visitor only when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with this
				Site's policies or to protect our services, members, this Site or others.</p>
				<h3><strong>Cookies</strong> </h3>
				<p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a device accessing the
				Internet. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies on our Site or
				the pages we use to deliver our Offerings to you. A session ID cookie expires when
				you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your device for an extended
				period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in
				your Internet browser's "help" file. You can learn more about cookies at
				allaboutcookies.org.</p>
				<p>On our Site, we use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site by
				saving your preferences and to improve and track the overall Site experience. For
				our Site, we set a persistent cookie to determine your language and country so we
				can provide you with relevant content. If you reject cookies, you may still use our
				Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site may be limited. Please see the
				Section "Advertising" to learn more about cookies placed on this Site and third party
				websites.</p>
				<p>Cookies and similar files do not contain or capture unencrypted personally
				identifiable data. For many cookies, you may disable our placement of cookies on
				your device.</p>
				<h2>Cloud-based or back-up data</h2><p>
				If you use a Spare Backup cloud-based or back-up service, the information from your
				device and/or account that you choose to backup such as your contacts, email
				addresses, calendar, memo, tasks, display pictures, status messages, media files and
				other on-device information may be sent to Spare Backup or Spare Backup service
				providers. Spare Backup or Spare Backup service providers may store this information
				for you and may use this information in order to facilitate or improve the use, remote
				access and restoration of that data on your device through the Offerings provided.
				</p><h2>Use of Information</h2><p>
				Any information you submit on this Site and/or through our Offerings will be used for a
				variety of business purposes, including for example, to complete transactions and bill for
				Offerings; provide you with our Offerings; verify your identity; respond to your requests
				for service or assistance; anticipate and resolve actual and potential problems with our
				Offerings; create and improve Offerings; suggest additional or different Offerings; make
				internal business decisions about current and future offers; provide customized service
				and user experiences; protect our rights and property; and as otherwise disclosed at the 
				point where such information is collected or in any additional terms and conditions
				applicable to the particular feature of this Site and/or the Offerings.
				</p><h2>Information Sharing</h2><p>
				In order to carry out your requests, to make various features, services and materials
				available to you through this Site, to respond to your enquiries, and/or to provide our
				Offerings to you or enable a third party service provider to provide Offerings to you we
				may share your personally identifiable information with third parties. Such third parties
				are companies or individuals that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our
				partners), such as companies or individuals who analyze data, provide customer service
				or other Offerings, advertisers, sponsors or other third parties who participate in or
				administer our promotions or provide marketing or promotional assistance (but such
				information will be shared only to the extent they need such information to perform their
				functions). Your personally identifiable information may also be used by us or shared
				with our subsidiaries, affiliates, sponsors, partners, advertisers or other third parties to
				provide you with product information and promotional and other offers.
				Some of the aggregate or personally identifiable information that Spare Backup receives
				is collected through third party service offerings that are available through our Offerings.
				In these cases the third party service provider will require you to sign up for the
				applicable service offering and will include a link to the relevant privacy policy that
				applies to such collection (i.e. this Spare Backup Privacy Policy or the third party's
				privacy policy).</p>
				<p>We reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable
				information if we are required to do so by law or if we reasonably believe that such
				action is necessary in order to: (a) fulfil a government request; (b) conform to the
				requirements of the law or comply with any legal process served on us; (c) protect or
				defend our legal rights or property, this Site or our Offerings, or its users; or (d) in an
				emergency, protect the health and safety of this Site's users or the general public.
				Except as provided herein, you're personally identifiable information will not be provided
				to any third parties without prior approval from you.</p>
				<p>As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another
				entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, or assets related to this Site
				and/or the Offerings, personally identifiable information, non-personally identifiable
				information, and any other information that we have collected about the users of this
				Site and/or our Offerings will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred 
				assets. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us,
				all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or
				transferred to third parties.
				</p><h2>Choice and Access</h2><p>
				You may always direct us not to share your personally identifiable information with third
				parties, not to use your personally identifiable information to provide you with
				information or offers, or not to send you newsletters, emails or other communications
				by: (i) sending us an email at webmaster@SpareBackup.com;
				(ii) contacting us by post at Spare Backup Inc.,382 NE 191st Street #58973 Miami Florida 33179 U.S.A,
				Attention: Webmaster; or (iii) following the removal instructions in the communication
				that you receive. Your opt-out request will be processed within 30 business days of the
				date on which we receive it.</p>
				<p>In addition to your normal access to your web account information, we make good faith
				efforts to provide you with access to your personally identifiable information and either
				to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not
				otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask
				individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed,
				corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process
				requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate
				technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or
				for which access is not otherwise required.
				</p><h2>Advertising</h2><p>
				Spare Backup advertises on pages within the Site as well as on other websites not
				affiliated with Spare Backup. We contract with advertising service providers who serve
				advertising to you through the use of technologies, such as cookies and web beacons.
				Web beacons are small graphic images on a web page or on an HTML email that tell
				our advertising service providers the Internet address of the Site pages viewed by
				users, browsing patterns within the Site, and responses to advertisements and
				promotions on the Site.
				</p><h2>Behavioral Information/Targeted Marketing </h2><p>
				We also use advertising service providers to help us determine which of our
				advertisements are most likely to be of interest to you while you are on the Site. These
				advertising service providers may use anonymous behavioral information, such as how
				you navigate the site, to provide relevant advertisements to you while you are on Spare
				Backup websites. These advertising service providers do not have access to, or collect,
				personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, account
				number or telephone number.</p>
				<p>If you prefer not to have anonymous behavioral information used in this way, set your
				browser to not accept cookies, but doing so may cause you to experience some
				inconvenience in your use of the Site, as described above.
				</p><h2>Advertising on Other Websites</h2><p>
				Spare Backup contracts with advertising companies to advertise our accounts and
				Offerings on websites not affiliated with Spare Backup. If you click on one of our ads,
				you link to the third party website that offers the advertised account or Offerings. These
				ads may contain cookies that allow tracking of your response to our advertisements.
				These cookies do not identify you personally.
				Spare Backup's advertising service providers, such as Google, Yahoo! or
				MSN/Microsoft, may offer a way to opt out of targeted advertising based on the use of
				their cookies.</p>
				<p><b>In addition, if you prefer that our advertising service providers not know
				which Spare Backup website pages you have viewed, visit the Network Advertising
				Initiative site: http://www.networkadvertising.org to opt out of ad targeting from
				participating companies.</b>In order for the opt-outs to work on your computer, your
				browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new computer,
				access the Site from a different computer, log in under a different screen name, or
				change web browsers, you will need to opt out again. If your browser has scripting
				disabled, you do not need to opt out, as behavioral marketing technology does not work
				when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate
				whether scripting is active or disabled.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, if you prefer not to have anonymous behavioral information used in this
				way, set your browser to not accept cookies, but doing so may cause you to experience
				some inconvenience in your use of the Site.
				</p><h2>Children Under 13 </h2><p>
				This Site and our Offerings are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly
				collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we
				become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information
				from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such
				information from our records.
				</p><h2>Keeping Your Information Secure</h2><p>
				We have reasonable security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and
				alteration of the information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while
				we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot
				guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us
				online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of
				your personally identifiable information.</p>

				Backup Partner Program, access to your account will be protected by your password.
				We recommend that you do not disclose your password to any other person. You are
				solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and
				are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.
				</p><h2>Additional Information Regarding Network Attached Storage</h2><p>
				Our Network Attached Storage feature enables you to share files from your storage
				device over the Internet only with people authorized by you. Authorized users have
				access only to those files you specifically designate. Although the "Network Attached
				Storage" feature is designed so that no one can access your files over the Internet
				without your permission, Spare Backup cannot guarantee or warrant that others will not
				be able to access your files.</p>
				<p>You connect with our servers during sign-in. After you have successfully signed in, you
				can view and download files that you have enabled for web access or that have been
				shared with you by others.</p>
				<p>We give you the option of creating private, password-protected folders and files on your
				storage device. Except as stated below, your files are stored only on your storage
				device, not on our servers, The "Network Attached Storage" feature is designed so that
				only you and the people with whom you choose to share your files ever see your data.
				Bear in mind that any files or pictures you share using the storage device can be saved 
				and forwarded by the people with whom you share them. We do not keep records of
				your files on our servers, nor do we track the sharing activity of your files.</p>
				<p>We may store the file directory of your storage device on our servers. You use this
				directory to navigate and select the files you want to view or download when you are
				away from your storage device. When you download a file from the Web Service, you
				are pulling the file directly from your personal server, not from our servers. We may also
				store some directory names (but not file names) in our secure data center in order to
				provide persistent share information and descriptions to your recipients. The storage
				device service times out signed-in users automatically after a period of inactivity.</p>
				<p>If we suspect that your account has been compromised or is being used suspiciously,
				we will deactivate the account and notify you.Notify us immediately by sending an email
				to webmaster@SpareBackup.com if you think your account has been compromised.</p>
				<p>All data transmissions between your storage device and your authorized web users are
				protected by 128-bit SSL encryption. Our service hardware is housed in a secure,
				access-controlled data center where each access is logged. Only authorized employees
				with a need for access are granted access.
				</p><h2>Other Sites and Third Party Offerings</h2><p>
				This Site may contain links to other websites that we do not control or maintain. We
				encourage you to note when you leave this Site and to read the privacy statements of
				such other websites before submitting any personally identifiable information.
				Additionally, if you access a third party branded service through an API or otherwise,
				you are solely responsible for understanding, agreeing to and complying with the third
				party service terms and conditions of use and privacy policy. Spare Backup is not
				responsible for the privacy policies or security of third party websites and/or services.
				</p><h2>International Processing and Transfer of Data</h2><p>
				Given that we are an international business, our use of your information necessarily
				involves the transmission and processing of data on an international basis (including in
				and to the United States and countries other than the country where the data was
				collected from you, which may not have data protection laws as stringent as those that
				exist in your country of residence). By using this Site and/or the Offerings, or providing
				personally identifiable information to Spare Backup you consent to the collection,
				processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States 
				and other applicable territories outside of the country where the data was collected from
				you.

				</p><h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2><p>
				Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature and/or as required by law or regulatory
				change, Spare Backup may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so,
				Spare Backup will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site along with a change
				notice on the Site. Spare Backup may also send registered users of our Offerings a
				notice that this Privacy Policy has been changed. Spare Backup encourages you to
