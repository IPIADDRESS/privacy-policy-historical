Backup, Inc. ("SBI") is committed to protecting your privacy in
handling personally identifiable information relating to you, your transactions
with us, and the Services you use from us. This Privacy Statement describes the
personally identifiable information we gather about you, what we do with it,
the safeguards we have in place to protect it, and how you can control our use
of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
						<h3 style="line-height:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana">What
personally identifiable information does Spare Backup, Inc. request?<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
						<p style="line-height:10.5pt"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana">SBI
collects personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us
when you register on our Website, complete an order to purchase, sign up for a
user name and password to use one of our services, call us by telephone or send
us a letter or email. This personally identifiable information may include your
name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, fax number, credit card
number and expiration date, and other optional demographic information. In
addition, when you choose to purchase our services via our Website, this
information is used to verify your credit card information. You may browse our
Website without supplying any personally identifiable information, but we will
need to collect personally identifiable information to process your orders or
to send you offers or information that you request.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
						<h3 style="line-height:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Does Spare
Backup, Inc. use "cookies"?<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
						<p style="line-height:10.5pt"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana">In
order for you to use our Website, your computer must accept the use of
cookies. A cookie is a small data file that is stored on your computer's hard
drive. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information and do not
give us control over your computer. We use cookies to identify you when you
return to our Website so we can make the user experience more enjoyable, and
to track your activity on our Website. We also use cookie data when you have
expressly requested to use our "Auto Login" feature, which
automatically accesses user ID and password information and automatically logs
you into our products and services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
						<h3 style="line-height:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana">How does Spare
Backup, Inc. use personally identifiable information about you?<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
						<p style="line-height:10.5pt"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana">The
personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us will be
used to process your orders, and may be used to identify you within our
systems. We may use your email address to contact you if we have questions
about your order or service. We may also use your email address to notify you
about new services or special promotional programs, or to send you offers or
information. <span style="color:navy">SBI</span> will not disclose personally
identifiable information about you to others except as disclosed in this
Privacy Statement or as specifically authorized by you at the time the
information is collected. We contract with third parties to provide specific
products or services to you. For example, we use a credit card company to
process credit card applications, issue credit, verify, bill, and collect
payments when you make a purchase with a credit card; an outside shipping
company to ship orders if applicable; outside direct mail and catalog vendors
to provide customers with product and sales information; or to send emails to
customers and prospective customers. These service providers are provided with
only the information that they need to perform their functions and are required
to agree not to use or disclose your personally identifiable information for
other purposes without your authorization. We may also share your personally
identifiable information within the <span style="color:navy">SBI</span> family
of businesses. If we enter into marketing relationships with advertisers or
other companies that provide products or services that we believe may be of
interest to <span style="color:navy">SBI</span> customers, we may share
non-identifiable aggregated information with these companies, and, in addition,
we may provide them with mailing address information so that they may extend
offers to you. However, we will not disclose your email address, telephone
number, or credit card account information without your consent. To make online
shopping more convenient for you, our Website may provide access to other
companies' Websites or co-branded Websites that may be designed to look
similar to our Website; these sites are fully operated by the other company.
If you request additional information or order products or services from one of
the companies featured on our Website, that company may provide us with the
information you have given to them (except in the case of credit application
information, financial background or health information, which we do not
receive from such featured companies). We are not responsible for the content
appearing on these companies' Websites or for the privacy practices of these
companies. We encourage you to read the privacy policy on the other company's
Website if you have any concerns about how information may be collected or
used. If you make a purchase or request a service from a featured company that
you access through a frame on our Website, information relating to that
transaction will be available to us as well as the featured company. We may use
third-party advertising technology to serve ads when you visit our site and
sites upon which we advertise. This technology uses information about your
visits to the <span style="color:navy">SBI</span> Website and the sites upon
which we advertise, (not including your name, address, or other personal
information), to serve our ads to you. In the course of serving our
advertisements to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized
on your browser. In addition, we may use Web beacons, provided by our ad
serving partner, to help manage our online advertising. These Web beacons
enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this
site and to learn which banner ads bring users to our site. This information we
collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable. We
may share personally identifiable information with law enforcement or other
entities as required by law or as we reasonably determine to be necessary to
protect our rights or the rights of others, to prevent harm to persons or
property, to fight fraud, or to enforce our Website terms and conditions.
Personally identifiable information may be transferred as an asset in
connection with a merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of an
insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of our businesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
						<h3 style="line-height:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Does Spare
Backup, Inc. conduct special programs that use personally identifiable
information?<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
						<p style="line-height:10.5pt"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana">We
occasionally conduct surveys, contests, or other promotional programs that
involve the collection of personally identifiable information, and we may send
promotional emails to such participants from time to time. Participation in
these programs is completely voluntary, so that you have a choice whether to
disclose the requested information without limiting your ability to place
orders for products and services. Information requested may include contact
information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information
(such as gender, zip code, or age). Contact information will be used to notify
participants of the outcome of such promotions. Survey information may be used or
disclosed for purposes of monitoring or improving the performance of our
retail, catalog, or Website operations. We generally do not collect
information through our Website from children under age <span style="color:navy">18</span>. If we conduct a special online program that is
open to children, children under age <span style="color:navy">18</span> will be
permitted to participate only with the consent of a parent or guardian or will
otherwise be given the opportunity to participate without the need to provide
personally identifying information.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
						<h3 style="line-height:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana">How is my
personally identifiable information protected?<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
						<p style="line-height:10.5pt"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana">We
have implemented numerous safeguards designed to protect personally
identifiable information, however, no system of security is impenetrable. Our
databases are protected by physical, technical, and procedural measures that
restrict information access to authorized persons in accordance with this
Privacy Statement. Our information systems are maintained behind a secure
firewall to isolate them from access by other networks connected to the
Internet. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are
granted access to personally identifiable information. When personally
identifiable information is collected through our Website, the transmission is
encrypted using industry-standard Secure Socket Layer ("SSL")
technology, and sensitive information such as credit card numbers or account
information is encrypted for further protection. Our Website is a "Secure
Site" recognized by Revising®, a leading computer network security company.
You also play a valuable part in security. Your password, user id and data
encryption keys to access our Website and/or our Services should never be
shared with anyone and should be changed frequently. After you have finished
using our Website, you should log out and exit your browser to prevent
unauthorized users from returning. If you believe that someone has improperly
used personally identifiable information about you or has made purchases that
you did not authorize, please contact us immediately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
						<h3 style="line-height:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana">How can I
limit the use and sharing of personally identifiable information about me?<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
						<p style="line-height:10.5pt"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana">You
may decline to receive promotional email from us. Every promotional email we
send contains instructions and an Internet link to opt out of future email
promotions. You may also opt-out of promotional emails by sending an email
request to sales@sparebackup.com or by calling us at (760) 340-4450. We reserve
the right to change our data practices from time to time. The current Privacy
Policy will always be posted online at our Website. If we revise our
Privacy Statement, you may decline to permit us to use your personally
identifiable information under the new policy by notifying us as described
above.

our Website, the user agrees to the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy
Statement and the Site Terms of Use INCLUDING ALL LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES
