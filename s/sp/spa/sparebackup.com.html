<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Spare
Backup, Inc. ("SBI") is committed to protecting your privacy in
handling personally identifiable information relating to you, your transactions
with us, and the Services you use from us. This Privacy Statement describes the
personally identifiable information we gather about you, what we do with it,
the safeguards we have in place to protect it, and how you can control our use
of it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">What
personally identifiable information does Spare Backup, Inc. request?</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">SBI
collects personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us
when you register on our Website, complete an order to purchase, sign up for a
user name and password to use one of our services, call us by telephone or send
us a letter or email. This personally identifiable information may include your
name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, fax number, credit card
number and expiration date, and other optional demographic information. In
addition, when you choose to purchase our services via our Website, this
information is used to verify your credit card information. You may browse our
Website without supplying any personally identifiable information, but we will
need to collect personally identifiable information to process your orders or
to send you offers or information that you request.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Does
Spare Backup, Inc. use "cookies"?</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">In order
for you to use our Website, your computer must accept the use of cookies. A
cookie is a small data file that is stored on your computer's hard drive.
Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information and do not give us
control over your computer. We use cookies to identify you when you return to
our Website so we can make the user experience more enjoyable, and to track
your activity on our Website. We also use cookie data when you have expressly
requested to use our "Auto Login" feature, which automatically
accesses user ID and password information and automatically logs you into our
products and services.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">How
does Spare Backup, Inc. use personally identifiable information about you?</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">The
personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us will be
used to process your orders, and may be used to identify you within our
systems. We may use your email address to contact you if we have questions
about your order or service. We may also use your email address to notify you
about new services or special promotional programs, or to send you offers or
information. SBI will not disclose personally identifiable information about
you to others except as disclosed in this Privacy Statement or as specifically
authorized by you at the time the information is collected. We contract with
third parties to provide specific products or services to you. For example, we
use a credit card company to process credit card applications, issue credit,
verify, bill, and collect payments when you make a purchase with a credit card;
an outside shipping company to ship orders if applicable; outside direct mail
and catalog vendors to provide customers with product and sales information; or
to send emails to customers and prospective customers. These service providers
are provided with only the information that they need to perform their
functions and are required to agree not to use or disclose your personally
identifiable information for other purposes without your authorization. We may
also share your personally identifiable information within the SBI family of
businesses. If we enter into marketing relationships with advertisers or other
companies that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest
to SBI customers, we may share non-identifiable aggregated information with
these companies, and, in addition, we may provide them with mailing address
information so that they may extend offers to you. However, we will not
disclose your email address, telephone number, or credit card account
information without your consent. To make online shopping more convenient for
you, our Website may provide access to other companies' Websites or co-branded
Websites that may be designed to look similar to our Website; these sites are
fully operated by the other company. If you request additional information or
order products or services from one of the companies featured on our Website,
that company may provide us with the information you have given to them (except
in the case of credit application information, financial background or health
information, which we do not receive from such featured companies). We are not
responsible for the content appearing on these companies' Websites or for the
privacy practices of these companies. We encourage you to read the privacy
policy on the other company's Website if you have any concerns about how
information may be collected or used. If you make a purchase or request a
service from a featured company that you access through a frame on our Website,
information relating to that transaction will be available to us as well as the
featured company. We may use third-party advertising technology to serve ads
when you visit our site and sites upon which we advertise. This technology uses
information about your visits to the SBI Website and the sites upon which we
advertise, (not including your name, address, or other personal information),
to serve our ads to you. In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a
unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. In
addition, we may use Web beacons, provided by our ad serving partner, to help
manage our online advertising. These Web beacons enable our ad server to recognize
a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site and to learn which banner
ads bring users to our site. This information we collect and share through this
technology is not personally identifiable. We may share personally identifiable
information with law enforcement or other entities as required by law or as we
reasonably determine to be necessary to protect our rights or the rights of
others, to prevent harm to persons or property, to fight fraud, or to enforce
our Website terms and conditions. Personally identifiable information may be
transferred as an asset in connection with a merger or sale (including any
transfers made as part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all
or part of our businesses.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Does
Spare Backup, Inc. conduct special programs that use personally identifiable
information?</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">We
occasionally conduct surveys, contests, or other promotional programs that
involve the collection of personally identifiable information, and we may send
promotional emails to such participants from time to time. Participation in
these programs is completely voluntary, so that you have a choice whether to
disclose the requested information without limiting your ability to place
orders for products and services. Information requested may include contact
information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information
(such as gender, zip code, or age). Contact information will be used to notify
participants of the outcome of such promotions. Survey information may be used
or disclosed for purposes of monitoring or improving the performance of our
retail, catalog, or Website operations. We generally do not collect information
through our Website from children under age 18. If we conduct a special online
program that is open to children, children under age 18 will be permitted to
participate only with the consent of a parent or guardian or will otherwise be
given the opportunity to participate without the need to provide personally
identifying information.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">How is
my personally identifiable information protected?</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">We have
implemented numerous safeguards designed to protect personally identifiable
information, however, no system of security is impenetrable. Our databases are
protected by physical, technical, and procedural measures that restrict
information access to authorized persons in accordance with this Privacy
Statement. Our information systems are maintained behind a secure firewall to
isolate them from access by other networks connected to the Internet. Only
employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access
to personally identifiable information. When personally identifiable
information is collected through our Website, the transmission is encrypted
using industry-standard Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology, and
sensitive information such as credit card numbers or account information is
encrypted for further protection. Our Website is a "Secure Site"
recognized by Revising®, a leading computer network security company. You also
play a valuable part in security. Your password, user id and data encryption
keys to access our Website and/or our Services should never be shared with
anyone and should be changed frequently. After you have finished using our
Website, you should log out and exit your browser to prevent unauthorized users
from returning. If you believe that someone has improperly used personally
identifiable information about you or has made purchases that you did not
authorize, please contact us immediately.</span></p>

can I limit the use and sharing of personally identifiable information about
me?</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">You may
decline to receive promotional email from us. Every promotional email we send
contains instructions and an Internet link to opt out of future email
promotions. You may also opt-out of promotional emails by sending an email
request to customer@sparebackup.com or by calling us at 760-340-4450. We
reserve the right to change our data practices from time to time. The current
Privacy Policy will always be posted online at our Website. If we revise our
Privacy Statement, you may decline to permit us to use your personally
identifiable information under the new policy by notifying us as described
above. </span></p>
