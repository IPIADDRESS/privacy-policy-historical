<p class="header">Privacy Policy</p>

<p>Welcome to Spanx.com. Your trust is one of our most important assets. We take seriously the protection and proper use of the personal information you supply to us. This policy explains what personally identifiable or personal information we may collect from you when you visit our website, how we use such information, and the choices you have regarding our use of this information.</p>

<p class="subheader">Security</p>

<p>We are committed to handling your personal information, including your online credit card transactions, with high 
standards of information security. We take appropriate physical, electronic and administrative steps to maintain the 
security and accuracy of personally identifiable information we collect, including limiting the number of people who 
have physical access to our database servers, as well as employing electronic security systems and password protections 
that guard against unauthorized access. Our website uses encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to 
protect your personal information during data transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, address 
and credit card number.  When the letters "http" in the URL change to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure 
area employing SSL; also, your browser may give you a pop-up message that you're about to enter a secure area.</p>

<p>You may purchase online merchandise by calling toll-free 1.888.806.7311 (7am-12am, 
7 days a week.) One of our customer service associates will gladly take your order.</p> 
 
<p>Our customer service centers also operate over a private, secure network. Please note that e-mail is not encrypted 
and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.</p>

<p class="subheader">Privacy policy</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on January 31, 2011. </p>

<p>Providing our customers the highest quality products and services, we use information from our interactions with you 
and other customers, as well as from other parties. Because we respect your privacy, we have implemented procedures 
designed to handle your personal information in a safe, secure, and responsible manner.</p> 

<p>As we take advantage of advances in technology to improve the services we offer, we will post them only on this 
website so encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis to understand our current privacy policy.</p> 

<p class="subheader">The information we collect</p>

<p>Generally, you may browse the website without providing any personally identifiable information. However, we may ask 
you to provide personally identifiable information at various times and places on this website. In some cases, if you 
choose not to provide us with the requested information, you may not be able to access all of this website or 
participate in all of its features.</p> 

<p>We receive and store any personally identifiable information you enter on the website, whenever you shop with 
Spanx - online or through our catalogs - or information you give us in any other 
way. For example, we may collect the following personally identifiable information: your name, address, telephone 
number, and e-mail address. If you use a credit or debit card, we will also include your account 
number. We may also collect personal information about you from third parties, such as demographic firms, to make our 
future marketing efforts more efficient.</p>

<p>When you register with us as an online customer, we may ask for additional information, such as your favorite 
Spanx® product.</p> 

<p>If you use one of our services or participate in one of our promotions or sweepstakes, we may ask for additional 
information, such as your age, interests, or product preferences.</p> 

<p>From your purchases and other interactions with us, we obtain information concerning the specific products or 
services you purchase or use.</p>

<p>When you visit this website, our web server automatically collects anonymous information such as log data and IP 
addresses. We may use the automatically collected information for a number of purposes, such as improving our website 
design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions.</p>
 
<p class="subheader">How we use the information we collect</p>

<p>We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>to complete your purchase transactions </li>
<li>to provide the services you request </li>
<li>to send you our catalogs and other offerings by mail </li>
<li>to keep you informed about the status of your orders </li>
<li>to identify your product and service preferences, so we can notify you of new or additional products, services, and 
promotions that might be of interest to you </li>
<li>to notify you of product recalls or provide other information concerning products you have purchased </li>
<li>to improve our merchandise selections, customer service, and overall shopping experience </li>
</ul><br>

<p class="subheader">Who we disclose the information to</p>

<p>We may disclose information to outside companies that help us bring you the products and services we offer. For 
example, we may work with an outside company to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b) assist us in 
distributing e-mails; (c) assist us with direct marketing and data collection; (d) provide us storage and analysis; (d) 
provide fraud prevention services; and (e) other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. 
</p>

<p>Other companies: We may provide information to carefully selected outside companies when we believe their products 
or services may be of interest to you.</p> 

<p>Business Transitions: We may transfer or share personal information about you if Spanx, Inc. goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or 
part of its assets in these situations. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our website prior to a 
transfer or control of your personal information, if your personal information will be used contrary to this policy. 
However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Spanx to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets to an affiliate or independent third 
party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever. Spanx 
specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its 
websites to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information. </p>

<p>Compliance with Law: We may provide access to information when legally required to do so to cooperate with police 
investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website, to limit our 
legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property, or safety of visitors of this website or the 
public. </p>
 
<p class="subheader">Your choices regarding use of the information we collect </p>

<p>We provide you with a number of choices regarding our handling of your personally identifiable information. </p>

<p>Direct Mail Marketing: If you wish to be removed from the list of customers that receive direct mail, please either: 
write to: Spanx Customer Relations, 1435 International Drive Eau Claire, WI 54701 or call 1.888.806.7311.</p>

<p>If you choose to write to us, please include your name, address, phone number, and email address and state "NO MAIL 
OFFERS" if you don't want to receive offers by mail.</p>

<p>Because customer lists often are prepared well in advance of an offering (sometimes a few months before the offer is 
made), you may continue to receive some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified 
marketing purposes. We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us time to carry out your request. </p>

<p class="subheader">Your California Privacy Rights </p>

<p>Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice 
describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for 
those third parties for direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of information shared and 
will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and addresses. 
If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following 
address: Spanx Customer Relations, 1435 International Drive Eau Claire, WI 54701. Please allow 30 days for a response.</p>

<p class="subheader">E-mails </p>

<p>If you do not want to receive promotional email from Spanx or its affiliates 
you can click on the unsubscribe link and hit send at the bottom of any email communication sent by us. Please allow us 
30 business days from when the request was received to complete the removal, as some of our promotions may already have 
been in process before you submitted your request. </p>

<p class="subheader">Cookies and how we use them </p>

<p>Our website uses "cookie" and "web beacon" technology. We use cookies and web beacons to distinguish you from other 
visitors, track your IP address and usage of our website, and to identify the name of the website from which you linked 
to www.spanx.com. This information is used for fulfilling contracts with our business 
partners and to help us serve you better by improving our website design, as well as our products, services, and 
promotions. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites. Non-personally identifiable 
information obtained through cookies and web beacons may be shared with or obtained by service providers on our behalf. 
</p>

<p>A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. A "session 
cookie" expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser). A "persistent cookie" stores 
information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie 
information is still available. A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image and is 
used in conjunction with a cookie. </p>

<p>When you visit our website, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. This cookie may contain information 
(such as a unique user ID) that is used to track your usage of our website and in some cases, your email address. A web 
beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor's actions on a website, such as a 
visitor's cookie number, the time, date, duration, and number of page views, a description of the page where the Web 
beacon is placed, and details about any items that were purchased. </p>

<p>If you register with us, your cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our website and provides you with 
access to your account information. If you save your information with or order from us, we may also use cookies to 
monitor and maintain information about your use of our website. If you have not saved your information with or ordered 
from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you. 
You can disable cookies at any time by using your browser options; however, if you turn off cookies, we will not be 
able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our website. In addition, we will not be able to 
recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information.</p>

<p class="subheader">Children's privacy </p>

<p>Protecting children's privacy is important to us. Our website is a general audience website. No part of our website 
is targeted to attract anyone under 13. Our online sweepstakes are restricted to entrants who are at least 18 years 
old. </p>

<p>Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any 
personal information to anyone online. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children's online 
activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children's access to the web. </p>

<p class="subheader">Links to other websites </p>

<p>While visiting www.spanx.com, you may link to websites operated by our business 
partners or other third parties. This does not mean that we endorse companies, their products, or their websites. We do 
not make any representations or warranties about any website you may access through www.spanx.com. They are independent from us, and we have no control over or responsibility for their 
information or activities. </p>

<p>In addition, our privacy practices may differ from those of these other websites. If you provide personal 
information at one of those websites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that website, not the 
Spanx privacy policy. Make sure you understand any website's privacy policies 
before providing personal information. </p>

<p class="subheader">Online account registration </p>

<p>To make online shopping faster and easier, you may register with www.spanx.com. As a 
registered customer, you only have to enter your shipping addresses and billing information once; they will be securely 
stored with us for your future use. Using your name and a password of your choice, you may access your account online 
at any time to add, delete, or change information. </p>

<p>If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to LOG OUT at the conclusion of your session. Your 
information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer. </p>

<p class="subheader">Acceptance </p>

<p>By using this website, you accept the policies set forth in this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p class="subheader">Any questions?</p>

<p>We'll be happy to provide additional information or answer any questions. Please:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call toll-free: 1.888.806.7311<br></li>

</ul><br>

<p class="subheader">Mac user advisory </p>

<p>Macintosh users must place their online orders using Safari or Firefox. These browsers allow us to offer our 
customers the highest level of security; other browsers prevent users from viewing secure pages during the checkout 
process. We apologize for any inconvenience. </p>

<p>You also may place an order for catalog merchandise by calling 1.888.806.7311.</p>

<p class="subheader">Conditions of use, notices and disclaimers</p>

<p>When you use this website, you are automatically agreeing that both your access to the website and your use of it 
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Subject to the terms and conditions in this legal notice, which may change at any time without notice. </li>
<li>Subject to all applicable laws. </li>
<li>Undertaken at your own risk. </li>
</ul><br>

<p>Please refer to this page frequently to review our current terms and conditions of use. </p>

<p class="subheader">Protecting your information </p>

<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to ensure that your shopping experience with www.spanx.com is protected, Spanx will prosecute all unauthorized 
or fraudulent transactions to the fullest extent allowed by law.</p>
