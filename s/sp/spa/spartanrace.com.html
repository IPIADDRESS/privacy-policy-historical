<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="nice_titles">1. Purpose</h4>

  your information, (3) what we use your personal information for, (4) when we
  might disclose your personal information, and (5) how you can manage your personal
  information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be advised that the practices described in this privacy policy apply
  only to information we gather on our site. They do not apply to information
  that you provide to 3rd party sites such as RaceIt.com or Active.com or any registration company we utilize to register for an event, to other
  third parties with links on our web site or to vendors, sponsors, partners, affiliates or social networking sites such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc. Please review their seperate privacy policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="nice_titles">2. Your Acceptance</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By visiting our Site, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy
  Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy, please do not
  use the Site. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from
  time to time without notice. Your continued use of our Site following the posting
  of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="nice_titles">3. Contact</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, don’t see your
  concerns addressed here, or wish to make changes to any personal information
  we have collected, you should contact us by email at &nbsp;<a href="mailto:SpartanUSA@spartanrace.com">SpartanUSA@spartanrace.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="nice_titles">4. Information We May Collect</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except as disclosed below, we don’t sell, barter, give away, or rent
  your personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px">(a) Personal Information. Use of certain features of the site, like signing
  up to receive a newsletter, or responding to one of our surveys may require
  that you provide certain personally identifiable information, in other words,
  information that identifies or describes you, such as your name, email address,
  telephone numbers, address, zip code, age, and gender (“personal information”).
  We also may collect and store personal information about you that we receive
  from other sources, e.g. the information we receive from RaceIt.com or Active.com
  or any race registration company we utilize when you register for an event
  or to be a spectator. RaceIt.com and Active.com have their own privacy
  policies and you should refer to them for any questions you may have about
  the information RaceIt or Active collects about you when you register for one
  of our events or to be a spectator using RaceIt.com or Active.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px">(b) Anonymous Information. Even if you don’t request a newsletter or
  fill-out a survey, when you interact with the site, we may collect certain
  non-personal information. For example, our servers keep an activity log that
  tracks all visitors to the site. The information in the activity log is anonymous
  and therefore does not identify you individually. The anonymous information
  our server collects may include among other data: your IP address, your registered
  domain or home server, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited,
  number of clicks, software crash reports, type of browser used, session identification
  number, search terms, search results, access times and referring website’s
  addresses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px">(c) Cookies and Spyware. We do not install spyware on your computer, nor do
  we use spyware to retrieve information from your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px">Like many websites, we may use “cookies”, which are small text
  files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain
  online pages that record your preferences. We use cookies to track your use
  of our website and its features. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic,
  improve the site and make it easier and/or more relevant for your use. </p>

  We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our privacy
  policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px">You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
  accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting
  to decline cookies. For more information on cookies and how to disable them,
  you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau
  at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. </p>

  other services relating to site activity and internet usage. </p>

  to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s
  behalf. By using the website, you consent to the processing of data about you
  by Google in the manner and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px">(e) No Information Collected From Children. Our site is not directed to children
  under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
  children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age you should
  not use this site, and under no circumstance should you send information about
  yourself to us. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided
  us with personal information, we will immediately delete that child’s
  information from the site. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="nice_titles">5. How We May Use Your Information</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except as disclosed in this privacy policy, we do not use or disclose information
  about your individual visits to our site or your personal information collected
  online to any parties other than those with whom we partner or are affiliated

  with members of the media and other third parties for marketing and promotional
  purposes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px"> • If you fill out a Spartan Race Survey, we

  collectively use the site. We may also use or share anonymous information (or
  other information, other than personal information) in any other manner that
  we decide is appropriate or necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px">(d) Third-Parties. We may occasionally have third party representatives, agents,
  affiliates and partners that perform functions on our behalf, such as event
  registration, marketing, analytics, etc. These entities may have access to
  your personal information but only as needed to perform their services. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px">(e) Emergency Situations. We may also use or disclose personal information
  if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is
  necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served
  on us or the site; (b) protect and defend the our rights or property, the site
  or our users, and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal
  safety of us, our affiliates, agents, or the users of the site or the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="nice_titles">6. Security</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The security of your information is of great concern to us. We exercise care
  in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to
  our servers. Personal information collected by our site is stored in secure

<p>&nbsp;</p>

  websites (e.g. RaceIt.com or Active.com), operated by our affiliates, partners
  or third parties. Please be advised that the practices described in this privacy
  policy for us do not apply to information gathered through these other websites.
  These other sites may also send their own cookies to you, collect your data
  or solicit your personal information. Always be aware of where you end up.

  and other websites. We encourage you to be aware of when you leave this site
