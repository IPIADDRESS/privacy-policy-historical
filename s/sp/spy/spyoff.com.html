<p>SpyOFF is committed to protecting online privacy. Therefore, we encrypt and anonymize the Internet connection of our users according to military standards. Our entire system has been designed to capture only the bare minimum of data needed to provide a world-class VPN service.</p>
<p>We attach great importance to understanding what information we collect, which information we DO NOT collect and what we use your information for.</p>
<p>The highest priority for us is data protection. There is no data retention in San Marino. So we can guarantee our no-log-policy (https://www.spyoff.com/en/no-logs). Once a user uses our VPN software, their Internet data is encrypted and their activities become invisible to ISPs, snoopers and criminals thanks to the latest security technologies. Users and their activities will at no time be monitored, logged, recorded, stored or shared with third parties while using our software.</p>

<p><strong>1. Scope of processing of personal data</strong></p>
<p>In principle, we process personal data of you only insofar as this is necessary for the provision of a functional website and our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users is basically only after the user's consent. An exception applies in cases where prior consent can not be obtained and the processing of the data is provided for by law </p>
<p><strong>2. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</strong></p>
<p>Insofar as we obtain your consent for processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as legal basis.
In the processing of personal data required for the performance of a contract of which you are a party, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO as legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual actions.
Insofar as processing of personal data is required to fulfill a legal obligation that is subject to our company, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO as legal basis.

<p>After activating the SpyOFF app you will be asked if you want to share this data. You can start or stop this diagnostic data at any time in the settings menu of the app. This is non-personal information. There is NO information about the activity that is being performed in the SpyOFF VPN tunnel, such as: Browser history, saved web content, VPN traffic destinations, DNS queries, and IP addresses.</p>
<p>SpyOFF uses the best physical, procedural and technical security with respect to our offices and information storage facilities to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or alteration of information. Access to user information is restricted to employees who need such access to perform their tasks. Although we believe that these systems are robust, it is important to understand that no data security measures in the world can provide 100% protection. Servers are located in data centers with strong security practices. None of these data centers require the collection or storage of traffic data or personal information related to your use of SpyOFF services. If any data center asked us to log such data, we would immediately stop using the data center and find alternative ways. Even if a government physically confiscates one of our VPN servers and manages to break their hard drive encryption, there are no protocols or information that bind a single user to a particular event, site, or behavior.</p>

<p><u>Google Adwords</u></p>
<p>For marketing purposes, we use Google Adwords, an advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").</p>
<p>The following functions of the service are used by us:</p>
<p><u>Remarketing</u> feature: This feature allows us to show you advertisements based on your interests on other websites within the Google Display Network. For this, your behavior on our website is analyzed (for example, interest in certain offers / content) in order to be able to show you targeted advertising even after your visit to other sites. Google uses cookies for this purpose. This number is used to uniquely identify a web browser on a particular computer and not to identify a person; personal information will not be stored. </p>
<u>Conversion Tracking:</u>
<p>
This will set a conversion tracking cookie on your machine when you click on a Google-served ad. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days, contain no personal data and are thus not used for personal identification. The information gathered using the conversion cookie is only used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking.
</p>
<p>You may disable the use of cookies by Google by following the link below and downloading and installing the plug-in provided there: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin.<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin</a></p>
<u>Double Click</u>
<p>To optimize and display advertising, we use DoubleClick from Google on our website (Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA).
Data is transferred to the DoubleClick server with every impression, click, or other activity. Each of these data transfers triggers a cookie request to your browser. If the browser accepts this request, DoubleClick sets a cookie on your system. The cookie is used, among other things, to serve and display user-relevant advertisements, as well as to generate reports on advertising campaigns or to improve them. Furthermore, the cookie is used to avoid multiple impressions of the same advertising.
DoubleClick uses a cookie ID required to complete the technical process. For example, the cookie ID is needed to display an ad in a browser. DoubleClick can also use the cookie ID to see which ads have already appeared in a browser to avoid duplication. DoubleClick also allows the cookie ID to track conversions. For example, conversions will be tracked if you've previously seen a DoubleClick ad, and then you're making a purchase on the advertiser's website using the same Internet browser.
A DoubleClick cookie does not contain any personally identifiable information. It can, however, contain additional campaign identifiers. This serves to identify the campaigns that you already use.
Each time you visit our website, which incorporates a DoubleClick component, the Internet browser on your computer is automatically driven by the relevant DoubleClick component to submit data to Google for online advertising and commission billing purposes. In this context, Google is aware of data that Google also used to create commission statements.
You may disable the use of cookies by Google by following the link below and downloading and installing the plug-in provided there: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin.
Additional information and DoubleClick by Google's applicable privacy policy can be found at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/.

<u>Bing Ads</u>
<p>For marketing purposes, we use Bing Ads (bingads.microsoft.com), a product of Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA ("Microsoft").
When you reach our website from a Microsoft Bing ad, Microsoft places a cookie on your machine. So for us Microsoft understands that someone has clicked on an ad, has been redirected to our website and has reached a previously determined landing page (conversion page). We only hear the total number of users who clicked on a Bing ad and were then redirected to the conversion page. Microsoft uses the cookie to collect, process and use information that generates usage profiles using pseudonyms. These usage profiles are used to analyze visitor behavior and are used to display advertisements. No personal information about your identity will be processed.
