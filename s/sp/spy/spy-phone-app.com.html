We do not collect passwords or credit card numbers. Your password is encrypted, only you know it. We don't process payments, so we don't need and we don't collect credit cards numbers.<br>

However, we reserve the right to delete the accounts of persons who violate the above Terms of Use. Here are the <b>cases we may use your personal data (including billing information):</b> <br>
<i>1. In case of a charge-back </i> (mainly for a fraudulent payment) we may provide information related to your account, including billing information. The content of the information is different from case to case and depends on the third-part (payment gate, Visa/MasterCard company or/and bank institution issuing the credit/debit card used for the specific payment). In case of a fraudulent transaction we'll block your account and it can not be unblocked at any time and for any cost.<br>

We store this information in order to be able to give you the free trial period of 3 days, otherwise we can not provide the trial, so you'll not be able to test the application before to buy a subscription which is against our policy. We remind you that this is the only reason we keep such information, we do NOT use your information otherwise then specified in this Privacy policy. If you want to use your right to be forgotten, please specify this explicit to our technical support and all this information will be deleted forever.

Our servers are highly secured. However, <i>in case of a data breach</i> we will contact the responsible Commissioner for Personal Data Protection and we will inform you during 72 hours on your registered e-mail address.
