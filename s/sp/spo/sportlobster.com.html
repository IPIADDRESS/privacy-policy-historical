            We know how important your privacy is to you, and it's important to us that you feel safe and secure on our site and other services.

We may collect and process the following data about you:
        </p>
        <p>
            Information that you provide when you fill in forms on our site, such as your name, username, password, date of birth, address, email address, gender and location. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our site and services, including on your profile page and in search results. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our site and/or services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additional information when you provide us with profile information to make public, such as a micro biography, your website, or a picture. You may provide further information to customize your account. <u>Your account settings control whether others can find you by your email address</u>.

This can be altered in your Profile Visibility in Account Settings. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, <u>your public user profile information and public posts may be searchable by search engines</u>. <strong>When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via our site, you should consider carefully the information you are making public</strong>.
