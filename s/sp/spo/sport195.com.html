		<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">Sport195, Inc. (“Sport195”
	or “we”) operates Sport195.com. This Privacy Policy describes Sport195’s
	use and sharing of Personal Information identifiable information (“Personal
	Information”-- your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone
	number, or credit card number) that Members voluntarily provide to Sport195
	when they register (also known as “Registration Personal Information”).
	The Term “User” refers to a Visitor or a Member. This Privacy
	Policy applies to the services offered by Sport195, including any Sport195-branded
	URL (the “Sport195 Website”), the Sport195 instant messaging
	service, the Sport195 application developer service and other features (for
	example the video embedded players), Sport195 mobile services, and any other
	features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Sport195 in
	connection with the Sport195 Website (collectively, the “Sport195
	Services”). The Sport195 Services are hosted in the United States.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">The Sport195 Website is a general
	audience site and does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children
	under 13 years of age.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">From time to time Sport195 may
	modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law,
	our Personal Information collection and use practices, the features of the Sport195
	Services, or technology, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting
	by Sport195 on the Sport195 Website. Your continued use of the Sport195
	Services after Sport195 posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your
	acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you
	review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any
	changes. If Sport195 materially changes its practices regarding collection or
	use of your Personal Information, your Personal Information will continue to be
	governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been
	provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION OF Personal
	Information AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION ON SPORT195</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">
	<span class="GramE">General.</span>
	When Sport195 collects Personal Information from you it is because you are
	voluntarily submitting Registration Personal Information to us in order to
	register as a Member of Sport195. Sport195 may also collect Personal
	Information from you if you choose to participate in Sport195 Services
	activities like sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, because you want us to
	furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or information, or in
	connection with content or suggestions you submit to Sport195 for review.
</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">
	In addition, Sport195 collects 
	other non-Personal Information including IP address, aggregate user data, <span class="GramE">and</span>
	browser type. This data is used to manage and improve 
	the Sport195 Services, track usage, and for security purposes. 
</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">Sport195 Members may also choose
	to provide or store non-Personal Information in their profiles, including but
	not limited to date of birth, interests, sports information, hobbies, lifestyle
	choices, groups with whom they are affiliated (schools, companies), videos
	and/or pictures, private messages, bulletins or Personal Information statements
	(collectively “Profile Information”). The Profile Information in a
	Member’s profile is provided at his or her sole discretion.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">Sport195 Members can change their
	Registration Personal Information and Profile Information at any time and can
	control how Visitors, other Members and Sport195 communicate with them by
	controlling their account settings, available within the “Edit

	Cookies are small bits of information that Sport195 places on your computer. Sport195

</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">Third party advertisements
	displayed on Sport195 Services may also contain cookies set by Internet
	advertising companies or advertisers (known as “third party
	cookies”). Sport195 does not control these third party cookies and Users
	of the Sport195 Services should check the privacy policy of the Internet
	advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. See
	the “Notice” section below for more information on customized
	advertising on Sport195. A pixel tag is a tiny image inserted in a webpage and
	used to record the number and types of views for that page. Sport195 may allow
	third party pixel tags to be present on Sport195 Services for purposes of
	advertising, providing services or data and statistics collection.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">
	You can program your computer to

	not have access to certain features on the Sport195 Services.
</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">NOTICE: SPORT195 WILL PROVIDE YOU
	WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">When you voluntarily provide Personal
	Information to Sport195, we will make sure you are informed about who is
	collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and
	the types of uses Sport195 will make of the information to the extent it is
	being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this
	Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">At the time you provide your Personal
	Information, Sport195 will notify you of your options regarding our use of your
	Personal Information (See “Choice” below). Except as described in
	this Privacy Policy, Sport195 will not share your Personal Information with
	third parties unless you have given Sport195 permission to do so (See
	“Use” below).</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">Sport195 Services may be linked
	to Internet sites operated by other companies. Sport195 Services may also carry
	advertisements from other companies. Sport195 is not responsible for the
	privacy practices of websites or other services operated by third parties that
	are linked to or integrated with the Sport195 Services or for the privacy practices
	of third party Internet advertising companies. Once you leave Sport195 Services
	via such a link, access a third party application (such as widgets) or click on
	an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third
	party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle
	any Personal Information they collect from you.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">Sport195 Services may also be
	linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with Sport195 (i.e., that are
	part of the M10 Group: “Affiliated Companies”). Although all Affiliated
	Companies adhere to the M10 Group Privacy Principles, Users who visit those
	Affiliated Company sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies
	and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">Sport195 may use cookies and
	similar tools to customize the content and advertising you receive based on the
	Profile Information you have provided. Profile Information you provide in
	structured profile fields or questions (multiple choice questions like
	“Marital Status,” “Education” and
	“Children”) (“Structured Profile Information”),
	information you add to open-ended profile fields and questions (essay questions
	like “About Me,” “Interests” and “Sports”)
	(“Non-Structured Profile Information”) and other non-Personal
	Information about you may also be used to customize the online ads you
	encounter to those we believe are aligned with your interests. For example,
	based on your sports interests we might display an advertisement to make sure
	you are advised when your favorite team is coming to town. The information used
	for this feature does not provide your Personal Information or identify you as
	an individual to third parties. If you would like to disable advertising
	customization for Non-Structured Profile Information, please log in and click
	here.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">Some of the advertisements that
	appear on Sport195 Services may also be delivered to you by third party
	Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies to
	deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect non-Personal
	Information about your visit to or use of Sport195 Services, including
	information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer
	that reads your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these
	companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their
	own privacy policies, please click here.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">
	Third party applications (such as
	widgets) created by third party developers may also be available on the Sport195
	Services. Third party applications are small bits of software, often with 
	interactivity, that can be installed into Members’ profiles or shared 
	with other Users. However, Sport195 does not control the third party  
	developers, and cannot dictate their actions. <span class="GramE">When a User or Member
		engages with a third party application, that Member is interacting with the
		third party developer, not with Sport195.</span>
	Sport195 encourages Members 
	not to provide Personal Information to the third party’s application  
	unless the Member knows the party with whom it is interacting. 
</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">CHOICE: SPORT195 WILL PROVIDE YOU
	WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">Except as described in this
	Privacy Policy, Sport195 will get your permission before we use the Personal
	Information you provide to us in a way that is inconsistent with the purpose

<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">USE: SPORT195'S USE OF Personal

<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">Sport195 will only use the Personal
	Information you provide under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is
	consistent with this Privacy Policy. If Sport195 obtains Personal Information

	Members that you may already know in the physical world, Sport195 allows Users
	to search for Members using Registration Personal Information (i.e., full name
	or email address). Sport195 also allows Users to browse for certain Profile
	Information in order to help connect with Members (i.e., schools and/or
	companies where Users may have attended or worked). Sport195 may also enable
	Members to publicly display some Registration Personal Information as an
	element of their Profile Information if they choose to do so via a profile 
	setting under “Edit Profile.” Search engines may index the portion 
	of a Member’s profile (including the Profile Information it contains)  
	that is publicly displayed. </p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">If you have consented to receive
	promotional materials (e.g., newsletters) or notifications from Sport195, Sport195
	may periodically use your email address to send you such materials related to
	the Sport195 Services, as applicable. If you want to stop receiving such 
	materials from Sport195, you can change your profile settings under 
	“Account Settings,” or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the  
	bottom of each email. </p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">Sport195 employees, agents and

	example, message board administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses,
	data processing), or with outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us
	with the administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contests,
	promotions and sweepstakes.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">These outside contractors, agents
	or sponsors may temporarily store some information on their servers, but they
	may only use your Personal Information to provide Sport195 with a specific
	service and not for any other purpose. Sport195 may also provide your Personal
	Information to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to
	receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such
	a request requires the sharing of your Personal Information. Sport195 also may
	share your Personal Information with Affiliated Companies if it has a business
	reason to do so.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">As described in
	“Notice” above, Sport195 may customize the advertising and
	marketing messages you receive on the Sport195 Website, or may work with

	Information may be shared with these companies so this customization can be
	accomplished. Sport195 prohibits these companies from sharing your non-Personal
	Information and/or Profile Information with any third party or from using it
	for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream, number of page views calculated
	by pixel tags, and aggregated demographic information may also be shared with Sport195’s
	advertisers and business partners.</p>
<p class="document_text" style="text-align:justify">
	There may be instances when Sport195
	may access or disclose Personal Information, Profile Information or non-Personal

	protect or defend the legal rights or property of Sport195, our Affiliated
	Companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of
	our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of Users of the Sport195
	Services or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances;
	(iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply
	with the law or legal process. In addition, if Sport195 sells all or part of
	its business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a material part of its
	assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material
