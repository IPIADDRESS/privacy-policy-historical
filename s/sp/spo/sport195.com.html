    <h2>Disabling Cookies.</h2>

    <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="local_storage"></a>
    <h2>Local Storage Objects.</h2>

    <p>We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) to store your preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</p>

    <h2>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</h2>

    <p>Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="analytics"></a>
    <h2>Third Party Analytics.</h2>

    <p>We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, our Application. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences. We do not share your personal information with these third party analytic providers.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="ad_networks"></a>
    <h2>Third-Party Ad Networks</h2>

    <p>We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Site. We also may place banner ads on our Application. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about users of our Services.</p>

    <p>You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”).  For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI) and www.aboutads.info/choices  (DAA).</p>

    <p>Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites accessible by the above links. If you opt-out, you also may continue to receive banner ads on our Application.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="user_gen"></a>
    <h2>User Generated Content</h2>

    <p>As stated above, if you post content to our Site, all of the information that you post will be available to all visitors to our Site and Application. Your posting will become public and we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="links_apps"></a>
    <h2>Third-Party Links and Applications</h2>

    <p>Our Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.</p>

    <p>We also may make third party applications (such as widgets) available through our Services. Third party applications are small bits of software, often with interactivity, that can be installed into users’ profiles or shared with other users. SPORTS195 does not control how a third party uses the information that it collects from you. Please refer to their privacy policy for information about how they will use the information that they collect about you.</p>

    <h2>Security of My Personal Information</h2>

    <p>We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.</p>

    <p>You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="delete_account"></a>
    <h2>Accessing Your Personal Information and Deleting Your Account</h2>

    <h2>Notice to Non-U.S. Users of our Services</h2>

    <p>If you are located outside of the United States, please note that information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States.  By using our Site and Application, you consent to the transfer and processing of your information in the United States, which does not have data protection laws that provide the same level of protection that exists in your country. Your consent is voluntary. If, however, you do not consent, then we may not be able to provide you with our Services.</p>
