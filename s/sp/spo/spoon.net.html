        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><em>Last updated February 28, 2011</em></p>
        <p>We are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. The policies below are applicable to the Spoon.net web site and online services ("Web Site") and to various other products and services collectively branded "Spoon" ("Services") produced, operated, and maintained by Code Systems Corporation d/b/a Spoon, Inc. (collectively "Spoon" or "we", "us", or "our"). We have established this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to let you know the kinds of personal information we may gather during your visit to the Web Site, why we gather your information, what we use your personal information for, when we might disclose your personal information, and how you can manage your personal information.</p>
        <p>Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply only to information gathered online at our Web Site or through any Spoon products or services. It does not apply to information that you may submit to us offline, or to web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link.</p>
        <p><b>By visiting our Web Site or using our Services, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Web Site or Services. We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. Your continued use of our Web Site and Services following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. If we intend to apply the modifications or amendments to this Privacy Policy retroactively, we will provide you with notice of the modifications or amendments. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or don't see your concerns addressed here, you should contact us by email at support@spoon.net.</b></p>
        <p>From time to time, we add or change functions, features or products to our web sites or add or change Services. This, and our commitment to protecting the privacy of your personal information, may result in periodic changes to this Privacy Policy. As a result, please remember to refer back to this Privacy Policy regularly to review any amendments</p>

        <h3>Controllers of Personal Information</h3>
        <p>Any personal information provided to or to be gathered by Spoon is controlled primarily by Spoon, Inc., 1000 Dexter Avenue, 5th Floor, Seattle, WA 98109.</p>

        <h3>What information about me is collected and stored?</h3>
        <p>Spoon adheres to the highest standards of ethical practices in all of our operations and is dedicated to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our Web Site. Our privacy policy is simple: Except as disclosed below, we don't sell, barter, give away, or rent your personal information to any company outside of Spoon.</p>
        <p>Spoon collects and processes information about you in order to:</p>
        <p>Identify you each time you visit a Web Site or wish to have a Service provided;
        <br>Handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services, promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us;
        <br>Process and communicate with you about content you may submit to the Web Site, such as articles, product reviews, comments, photos, images, applications, virtual machine data and templates, and other content you may submit;
        <br>Improve our Services and Web Site;
        <br>Prevent fraud or detect abuse of our Web Site;
        <br>Customize your experience, for example, by providing advertisements that we think are relevant to you and which support any specific requests for information you may make through keyword searches;
        <br>Carry out research on the demographics, interests and behaviour of all of our customers;
        <br>Provide registration, usage, and analytical data to publishers of content on our Web Site and Services;

You may also be asked to share with us your interests, hobbies and preferences. In addition, when you order certain goods or services from our Web Sites, we will need to know your credit/payment card number and expiration date or other information required to process payments.</p>
        <p>We also collect and store information that you enter into this Web Site, through registration of a Spoon product or service, or that you provide through our help desk, customer service representatives, or requests for more information.

        <p>You are under no obligation to provide this information, but if you don't then we may not be able to provide you with certain services or personalize your experience and tailor our Services for you.</p>

        <h3>Log Files</h3>
        <p>When you visit our Web Sites, we automatically log your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet) which is automatically recognized by our web servers, time and date of access, web page(s), software crash reports, type of browser and operating system used, session identification numbers, and referring web sites.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Web Sites if you do so. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the web.

        <br>To control how often visitors see similar ads;

        <br>To track the progress and number of entries in some of our promotions and contests.

        <h3>Emergency Situations</h3>

        <h3>Information about products and services</h3>
        <p>It is very important to us that we provide you with the highest level of service.

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>Spoon places a great importance on the security of all information associated with our customers.

For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized personnel have access to user information. With regard to our Web Sites, we use secure server software (SSL, RSA, and/or AES-256 encryption) to encrypt financial information you input before it is sent to us. While we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur, we use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent this.</p>
        <p>While we try our best to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

        <h3>Your Obligations to Keep Your Access Rights Secure</h3>
        <p>You promise to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your business as prompted by the Web Site's registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Spoon has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Spoon has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Web Site (or any portion thereof). You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password, account, and client computer hardware and software operating environment.

        <h3>What About Contests and Sweepstakes?</h3>
        <p>When we run a contest or sweepstakes relating to this Web Site, it will be accompanied by a set of rules.

In conjunction you're your entry in such contest or sweepstakes, Personal Information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to our sponsors or us.</p>

        <h3>Public Areas, Chat Rooms and Newsgroups</h3>

We may offer a service that displays certain of your personal information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Web Site or in a shared product or service according to the preferences you set in your account.

You can review and revise your profile information at any time.</p>
