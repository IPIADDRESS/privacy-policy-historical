                    <h2><strong>Your acceptance of these Privacy Statement terms</strong></h2>
                    <p>By using any of the sites within our web site network ("Web Sites") or our   Services, you unconditionally agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <h2><strong>What data do we collect and how do we use it?</strong></h2>
                    <p>Code Systems collects and processes information about   you in order to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Identify you each time you visit a Web Site or wish to have a Service   provided; </li>

                        <li>Carry out research on the demographics, interests and   behaviour of all of our customers; and</li>
                        <li>Send you information we think   you may find useful, including information about new products and services.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>You may be asked, either when you register with us, or at other times, for   information about yourself, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address   and telephone number.&nbsp; You may also be asked to share with us your interests,   hobbies and preferences. In addition, when you order certain goods or services   from our Web Sites, we will need to know your credit/payment card number and   expiration date.</p>
                    <p>You are under no obligation to provide this information, but if you don't   then we may not be able to provide you with certain services or personalize your   experience and tailor our Services for you.</p>
                    <h2> <strong>Log files</strong></h2>
                    <p>When you visit our Web Sites, we automatically log your IP address (the   unique address which identifies your computer on the internet) which is   automatically recognized by our web servers.&nbsp; We use IP addresses to help us   administer our Web Sites and to collect broad demographic information for   aggregate use.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Non-personal information</strong></h2>
                    <p>We may automatically collect non-personal information about you such as the   type of Internet browser you use or the site from which you linked to our Web   Sites.&nbsp; You cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to   assist us in providing an effective service on our Web Sites.

You cannot be identified from   this information.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></h2>
                    <p>Cookies are pieces of information that a Web Site transfers to your hard   drive to store and sometimes track information about you.&nbsp; Most web browsers   automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to   prevent that.&nbsp; However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Web Sites   if you do so.&nbsp; Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot   be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your   movements around the web.&nbsp; Although they do identify a user's computer, cookies   do not personally identify customers or passwords.&nbsp; Credit card information is   not stored in cookies.</p>
                    <p>We use cookies for the following reasons: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To   identify who you are and to access your account information;</li>
                        <li> To   estimate our audience size and patterns;</li>
                        <li> To control how often visitors see similar ads;</li>
                        <li>To track preferences and to improve and update our Web Site; and</li>
                        <li> To track the progress and number of entries in some of our promotions   and contests.&nbsp; <br>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2><strong>With whom is the information shared?</strong></h2>
                    <p>Code Systems will not share, sell or rent your   personal information to third parties.&nbsp; However, we may disclose your personal   information to third party suppliers who provide services on our behalf.</p>
                    <p>Code Systems may disclose aggregate statistics about   our sales, our Web Site visitors and customers of our telephone services in   order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and other   reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will   not include personally identifying information.</p>
                    <p>Code Systems may disclose personal information if   required to do so by law or if it believes that such action is necessary to   protect and defend the rights, property or personal safety of company name and   its Web Sites, visitors to the Web Sites and customers of our Services.</p>
                    <p> Our Web Site contains links to the sites of third parties.&nbsp; When you   visit these sites, we suggest that you read their privacy policies. Code Systems is not responsible for the privacy policies   or the content of such sites.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;We will only sell or rent your personal information to a third party   either as part of a sale of the assets of a Code Systems company or having ensured that steps have been taken to ensure that your privacy   rights continue to be protected.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Advertising Networks</strong></h2>
                    <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit   our website. These companies may use information (not including your name,   address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other   web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest   to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your   choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">click   here</a>.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Information about products and services</strong></h2>
                    <p>It is very important to us that we provide you with the highest level of   service.&nbsp; In order to help us do this, from time to time Code Systems or its Affiliates companies may send you details of our products and services   which we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp; If at any time you do not wish to   receive these details, please contact us and request that you be unsubscribed from our mailing list.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Security</strong></h2>
                    <p>Code Systems places a great importance on the   security of all information associated with our customers. We have security   measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration   of customer data under our control.&nbsp; For example, our security and privacy   policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised   personnel have access to user information. With regard to our Web Sites, we use   secure server software (SSL) to encrypt financial information you input before   it is sent to us.&nbsp; While we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or   alteration of data will not occur, we use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent this.</p>
