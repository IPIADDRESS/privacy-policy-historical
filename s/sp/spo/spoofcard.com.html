<p><strong><a name="how-we-share-info">Sharing Or Disclosing Information</a></strong></p>

<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business. We DO NOT sell customer information. We share or disclose customer information only as described below. Except as described in this Policy, we will not disclose your information that we collect on the Service to third parties without your consent. We may disclose information to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:
</p><ul>
<li>We work with third party service providers that provide website, application development, hosting, maintenance, data transmission, data processing, and other services for us. These third parties may have access to or process your information as part of providing those services for us. However, we limit the personal information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions.  In addition, they agree by contract to maintain the confidentiality of such information.</li>
 <br>
<li>We may make certain automatically-collected, aggregated, or non-personally-identifiable information available to third parties for various purposes, including (i) ) to monitor network traffic or activity in order to detect protect you, ourselves or others from malware, fraud, unlawful uses or other illegal activity, (ii) compliance with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, or functionality available through the Service.</li>
<br>
 <li>We may share information with third parties for their own marketing purposes, which are subject to the separate privacy policies of such third parties. We will do this on the basis of your consent, where required by law, and if not required by law on the basis of our legitimate interests in sharing data with our partners so that we can help you see offers and services which are most relevant to you. To learn more about your choices related to how we share your information with third parties, please see the <a href="#your-choices">Your Choices</a> section below.</li>
<br>
<li>In addition, we have implemented on our website, the app and the Service certain Google Analytics features. Visitors to our websites may opt out of certain types of Google Analytics tracking, customize the Google Display Network ads by using the Google Ad Preferences Manager and learn more about how Google serves ads by viewing its Customer Ads Help Center. If you do not wish to participate in Google Analytics, you may also download the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.</li>
<br>
<li>We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state or federal laws (such as U.S. copyright law), in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies.</li>
 <br>
<li>We also reserve the right to disclose your information when we believe, in good faith, that disclosure is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the Service or any facilities or equipment used to make the Service available, or (v) protect our property or legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others.</li>
<br>
<li><a name="policy-changes">Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer of SpoofCard, or to a successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.  In the event SpoofCard is acquired by or merged with another company, the terms of this Privacy Policy shall continue to apply. In this event, SpoofCard will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. SpoofCard.com also reserves the right to display targeted advertisements based on personal information.</a></li>
</ul><p></p>

<p><strong>Information Retention Policy</strong></p>

<p>
If you hold an account with SpoofCard, we do not delete the data in your account – you are responsible for and control the time periods for which you retain this data. However, except when we believe we are required to retain your personal information by law, beginning on May 25, 2018, we will only retain your personal information for two years after we become aware that you have ceased using the Service.  We may not know if you have stopped using the Service so we encourage you to contact us at support@SpoofCard.com if you are no longer using the Service. We may retain other information that is not personally identifiable for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate interest in doing so.   
</p>

<p><strong><a name="your-choices">Your Rights Under GDPR</a></strong></p><a name="your-choices">

<p>
You may access, change or delete personal information that you have provided or that we hold about you.  If we change or delete your personal information or if you decline to actively share certain personal information with us, we may not be able to provide to you the Service or some of the features and functionality of the Service. <br>
In addition, you may request that we not disclose your personal information to third parties (other than those that are acting as our agent to perform tasks related to the Service on our behalf, such as data processors). <br>
If you receive commercial email from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within the email. You may also opt out of receiving commercial email from us, and any other promotional communications that we may send to you from time to time by clicking here. </p>
<p>
Please be aware that if you opt out of receiving commercial email from us or otherwise modify the nature or frequency of promotional communications you receive from us, it may take up to ten business days for us to process your request, and you may receive promotional communications from us during that period. Additionally, even after you opt out of receiving commercial messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us regarding the Service. <br>
You may withdraw consent to certain data sharing or usage or exercise any of these rights above by sending your request to us by email at Support@SpoofCard.com or by writing to us at the address given at the end of this policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to data portability. This means that you have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and that you have the right to transmit that data to another controller;
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are a user of the Service in the European Union or certain other countries, you have certain additional legal rights with regard to your information, including those identified below.

In some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process personal information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request. </p>

<p><strong>Confidentiality And Security</strong></p>

If we learn of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice through the Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

Code § 1798.80, a user residing in the State of California has the right to request from us a list of all third parties to which we have disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes.
