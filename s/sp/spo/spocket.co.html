YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS<br>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information.

This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.<br>● Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.<br>● Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the<br>right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.<br>● Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.<br>● Request restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the information’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.<br>● Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.<br>● Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.<br>● If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the details set out above.<br>No fee usually required<br>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.<br>What we may need from you<br>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.<br>Time limit to respond<br>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.<br>Effective date: October 12th, 2018</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div><div class="section-9" data-ix="load-on-scroll"><div class="div-block-24 reviews footer"><div class="div-block-26"><div class="footer-menu-3"><div class="footer-subtitle"><strong class="bold-text-2">SPOCKET</strong></div><a href="http://bit.ly/SpocketAppWebsit" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Signup</div></a><a href="https://app.spocket.co/" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Login</div></a><a href="/pricing" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Pricing</div></a><a href="/suppliers" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Suppliers</div></a><a href="https://angel.co/spocket/" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Careers</div></a><a href="/affiliates" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Affiliates</div></a></div><div class="footer-menu-3"><div class="footer-subtitle"><strong class="bold-text-2">COMMUNITY</strong></div><a href="https://www.facebook.com/spocketofficial/" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Facebook</div></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEpS093OwTR0KLez1dyrYQ" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Youtube</div></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/spocket.official/" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Instagram</div></a><a href="https://twitter.com/spocketofficial" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Twitter</div></a><a href="https://medium.com/spocketofficial" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Medium</div></a></div><div class="footer-menu-3 lower"><div class="footer-subtitle"><strong class="bold-text-2">SUPPORT</strong></div><a href="https://help.spocket.co/" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Help center</div></a><a href="mailto:support@spocket.co" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop"><div class="footer-submenu-2">Contact Us</div></a></div></div><div class="div-block-33"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5b3213161e5234bf1cfff9e1/5b321471bf86f77eb791aab4_Spocket%20%20logo%20color%20transparent.svg" width="150" alt=""><div class="text-block-2">Spocket helps dropshippers around the world discover and dropship US/EU based products.</div><div class="div-block-11"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/spocketofficial/" target="_blank" class="link-block-11 w-inline-block" data-ix="pop-2"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5b3213161e5234bf1cfff9e1/5b3601c52fe85b4181b267c2_2.svg" alt="" class="social-icon"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEpS093OwTR0KLez1dyrYQ" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop-2"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5b3213161e5234bf1cfff9e1/5b3601c879b4f48745651749_6.svg" alt="" class="social-icon"></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/spocket.official/" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop-2"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5b3213161e5234bf1cfff9e1/5b3601c5797d579facb8a980_3.svg" alt="" class="social-icon"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/spocketofficial" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop-2"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5b3213161e5234bf1cfff9e1/5b3601c8501b8e07a2b8a478_5.svg" alt="" class="social-icon"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/spocket-inc/" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop-2"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5b3213161e5234bf1cfff9e1/5b3601c5501b8e0cafb8a476_4.svg" alt="" class="social-icon"></a><a href="https://medium.com/spocketofficial" target="_blank" class="footer-link w-inline-block" data-ix="pop-2"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5b3213161e5234bf1cfff9e1/5b3601c5ab92062d175363bd_1.svg" alt="" class="social-icon"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="section-6"><div class="div-block-28"><a href="#" class="footer-link w-inline-block"><div class="text-block-2 end-footer">Copyright 2018, Spocket.
