<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
							    This privacy policy ("<b>Privacy Policy</b>") explains the data 
							    practices of SpotXchange LLC. ("<b>SpotXchange</b>", 
							    "<b>us</b>", or "<b>we</b>").  As a general 
							    description of our services, SpotXchange is a hosted advertising 
							    management platform that provides targeted advertisement insertion and 
							    scheduling, campaign management and reporting on a real time basis 
							    primarily used in the monetization of online video content.  
							    <a href="#part1">Part I</a> of this Privacy Policy describes our data 
							    practices with respect to information we collect about our customers and 
							    other visitors to the Website ("<b>Customers</b>"), while 
							    <a href="#part2">Part II</a> describes our data practices with respect 
							    to information collected by our Customers using SpotXchange's ad 
							    serving services.  The general provisions in <a href="#part3">Part III</a> 
							    apply to our data practices in both Part I and Part II.
							</p>
<p>
								As used in this Privacy Policy, "<b>Personal Information</b>" 
							    means information about you that is personally identifiable to you, 
							    such as your name, address, email address, phone numbers, 
							    or credit card number, as well as other non-public information that is 
							    associated with the foregoing. "<b>Anonymous Information</b>" means 
							    information that cannot identify a particular person.  
							</p>
<h3>
<a name="part1"></a>Part I	
							</h3>
<span class="bold">
								Customer-Provided Information
							</span><p>
								This Part I describes SpotXchange's use of Personal Information and 
								Anonymous Information that we collect when you or your representative 
								use our Services.  By visiting the SpotXchange website, located at 
							    <a href="http://www.spotxchange.com">http://www.spotxchange.com</a> 
							    (the "<b>Website</b>"), and/or using our service 
							    (the Website and services we offer are collectively referred to as the 
							    "<b>Services</b>"), you acknowledge that you accept the 
							    practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.  As used in this 
							    Part I, "you" and "your" refer to the employees or 
							    contractors of SpotXchange's Customers.
							</p>
<p>
								1. COLLECTION OF CUSTOMER-PROVIDED INFORMATION
							</p>
<p>
							    The individuals who represent SpotXchange's Customers or potential Customers 
							    ("Business Contacts") may voluntarily provide their contact information and 
							    related data, including Personal Information, to SpotXchange by various 
							    means, including telephone, email, postal mail, the "Sign Up" button for 
							    Advertisers, the "Apply" button for Publishers, or other means. The 
							    Personal Information submitted to SpotXchange is used to communicate 
							    with and provide services for Customers. SpotXchange corrects or 
							    updates Personal Information when requested to do so by the applicable 
							    Business Contact.   
							</p>
<p>
							    When a Business Contact accesses reports through SpotXchange's servers, or 
							    otherwise uses the SpotXchange platform, certain information may also be 
							    collected passively, including your Internet protocol (IP) address, 
							    browser type, and operation system. SpotXchange also stores a small text 
							    file called a cookie ("<b>Cookie</b>") on your computer. Each Cookie has a 
							    unique identifier ("<b>Cookie ID</b>") that enables us to recognize your 
							    login information and personalized settings. SpotXchange may use both 
							    session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and 
							    persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). 
							    SpotXchange also uses Cookies, and other navigational data that is 
							    passively collected, to gather information about your visit to the 
							    Services and the information which you searched and viewed on the Services. 
							    Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies, but you may reset 
							    your browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being 
							    sent. However, some features of the Services may not function properly 
							    if your Cookies are disabled. 
							</p>
<p>
							    We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources like 
							    telephone or fax, or from third parties that provide services for 
							    us in connection with the Services. We may add this information to 
							    the information we have already collected from you via our Services. 
							</p>
<p>
								2. USE OF CUSTOMER-PROVIDED INFORMATION
							</p>
<p>
							    In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used by us either to 
							    register you for our Services, respond to requests that you make, 
							    communicate with the Customer for whom you work regarding the Services 
							    (including for invoicing purposes), to improve our Services and to 
							    better tailor the features, performance and support of the Services, 
							    and to offer you additional information, opportunities, and 
							    functionality. If you provide feedback to us, we may use and 
							    disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we do not associate 
							    such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect any 
							    information contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal 
							    Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 
							</p>
<p>
							    We may provide Personal Information to third parties to the extent such 
							    third parties provide operational assistance (i.e., outsourced or third 
							    party services) to SpotXchange and then only for that purpose. 
							    Examples of such third party services include sending e-mail, 
							    providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, 
							    and providing customer service. However, these service providers
							    do not have any independent right to share this information (expect 
							    pursuant to a legal requirement such as a subpoena or warrant). 
							    SpotXchange is currently under common control with Booyah Networks, 
							    Inc., but otherwise does not currently have a parent company, any 
							    subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies controlling, 
							    controlled by or under a common control with Booyah Networks, Inc. 
							    (collectively, "Affiliates"). SpotXchange may share some or all of your 
							    Personal Information with current or future Affiliates, in which case 
							    we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.  
							</p>
<p>
							    SpotXchange may create Anonymous Information records from Personal 
							    Information by excluding information (such as your name) that make 
							    the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this 
							    Anonymous Information to analyze usage patterns so that we may 
							    enhance our Services. We reserve the right to use and disclose 
							    Anonymous Information to third parties in our discretion. This 
							    Anonymous Information may include, but is not limited to, browser 
							    type, URLs visited, and search terms entered. 
							</p>
<h3>
<a name="part2"></a>Part II
							</h3>
<span class="bold">
								Ad-Serving Information
							</span><p>
							    This Part II describes SpotXchange's use of Personal Information and 
							    Anonymous Information that we collect in connection with the 
							    SpotXchange's video advertisement serving technology. As used 
							    in this Part II, "you" and "your" refer to individuals who visit
							    websites that use SpotXchange's video advertisement serving 
							    technology. 
							</p>
<p>
								1. WHAT IS AD SERVING?
							</p>
<p>
							    In order to support their content without charging visitors, websites 
							    sell advertising space on their Web pages or within video content 
							    streamed on their Web pages. Companies like SpotXchange provide 
							    ads to websites and provide technology for the website publishers 
							    and advertisers to display or stream ads on the websites. 
							</p>
<p>
								When you visit a website, your computer's Internet browser transmits 
								a "request" to that website's server, "asking" that 
								server to send you the Web page that you are seeking.  Most Web pages 
								contain components that are pulled from different sources.  For example, 
								a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, 
								its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other 
								servers. 
							</p>
<p>
							    When you visit a website, your computer's Internet browser transmits a 
							    "request" to that website's server, "asking" that server to send you 
							    the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components 
							    that are pulled from different sources. For example, a Web page at a 
							    news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports 
							    results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. 
							</p>
<p>
						        If the website is using SpotXchange's technology to display ads on 
						        its site, the Web page will contain coding that directs your browser 
						        to fill the ad space on the Web page with content from one of 
						        SpotXchange's ad servers. SpotXchange's platform for streaming 
						        video ads enables advertisers to target their campaigns against 
						        particular contextual, geographic and demographic criteria 
						        associated with website publisher properties, and bid an amount 
						        they are willing to pay for this targeted impression. Each time 
						        a SpotXchange publisher queries our platform for an ad, 
						        SpotXchange serves the most valuable advertisement to the 
						        publisher's ad slot.  Please note that SpotXchange does not 
						        control the privacy policies of the publishers and advertisers 
						        who use our services.
						    </p>
<p>
								2. COLLECTION AND USE OF AD-SERVING INFORMATION
							</p>
<p>
							    Each SpotXchange publisher includes certain code on its website 
							    that enables SpotXchange to serve ads on the site and to place a 
							    Cookie.  The ads served may include tags enabling SpotXchange to 
							    collect information about a person’s interaction with the ad.  
							    Each time one of SpotXchange's servers receives a request for a 
							    video advertisement, Anonymous Information about the request 
							    received and the advertisement itself—for example, the date, 
							    the time, the geography of the user based on their IP address, 
							    the website to which the ad or image was delivered, the Cookie 
							    ID to which the ad was shown, the operating system which the
							    browser was using--will be recorded.  The Anonymous Information 
							    that is recorded on the SpotXchange servers is owned by SpotXchange. 
							</p>
<p>
						        3. OPTING OUT OF SPOTXCHANGE COOKIES
						    </p>
<p>
						        If you want your unique SpotXchange Cookie on your computer replaced with an opt-out Cookie, 
						        <a href="#opt_out_link">click here</a>.
						    </p>
<p>
						        The Cookies placed on your computer by SpotXchange are not Customer-specific.  
						        If you choose to opt out of our Cookies, we will place an opt-out Cookie on your 
						        computer, which will be effective for all of the websites and advertisers that 
						        use our ad-serving technologies.  Each website operator that uses our ad serving 
						        technology are required to post a privacy statement on the website that 
						        describes SpotXchange's collection and use of information through that 
						        website.  Most major third-party online advertising companies have 
						        agreed to provide an opt-out mechanism for their ad cookies.
						    </p>
<p>
						        If you select the opt-out Cookie, ads delivered to your browser on behalf of 
						        clients using our ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the 
						        information that is automatically transmitted in the Internet environment when 
						        an ad request is received by our ad servers (including, your browser type, 
						        Internet service provider, information about the general content of the site or 
						        page displayed on your browser and other non-personally identifiable 
						        information provided by the site), and your SpotXchange Cookie will not 
						        be uniquely identified. 
						    </p>
<p>
						        Note that: if you erase or otherwise alter your browser’s Cookie file you 
						        may need to opt out again; an opt out applies only to a specific user of a 
						        specific computer, i.e., opting out at work will not apply to your home 
						        computer; and opting out of our Cookies does not mean that you will stop 
						        seeing ads, only that the ads may be less relevant to you.  
						    </p>
<h3>
<a name="part3"></a>Part III
							</h3>
<span class="bold">General Provisions</span><p>
							    As used in this Part III, "you" and "your" refer to both SpotXchange's 
							    Customers and individuals who visit websites using SpotXchange's video 
							    advertisement serving technology. 
							</p>
<p>
								1. SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY
							</p>
<p>
							    SpotXchange has put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic, 
							    and organizational procedures to safeguard and secure the information we 
							    collect online. However, no company, including SpotXchange, can fully 
							    eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information. 
							</p>
<p>
