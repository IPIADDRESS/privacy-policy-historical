Whenever you provide personal information we will treat your information in accordance with this privacy policy, and will act in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. 

<h2>How your information is used</h2>

Comic Relief may ask you to submit personal information about yourself, such as your name and email address, postal address, telephone number and card details, so that we can provide you with services.

Please note that in some cases, for instance when you buy goods or donate, we may need to pass your information to companies who provide packaging, mailing, processing, data analysis and other services for us – however they may only use your information to deliver those services.

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use any service that you have requested, and will remove it in the event that the purpose has been met or you inform us that you no longer wish to receive the service in question.

We also use your information to identify you and provide a personalised service to you. We sometimes aggregate statistics about our supporters, donors and customers to enable us to operate more effectively, but these statistics do not include information from which individuals can be identified.
