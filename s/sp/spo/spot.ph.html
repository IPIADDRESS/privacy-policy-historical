			<span class="title">SPOT.PH Privacy Policy</span>			
			<ol style="font-weight:normal ">
<br>
SPOT.PH’s Privacy Policy below pertains to all websites, web pages and channels owned, controlled and/or operated by Philippine Entertainment Portal, Inc. (PEP, Inc.) under the SPOT.PH brand, including but not limited to all content, tools, quizzes, digital products, events, courses and/or products appearing throughout Summit Media magazine web sites. It covers how SPOT.PH treats personal information that it collects. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name or email address.<br><br><br>		
				<b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br><br>
				We will notify our members when we make any significant changes to our Privacy Policy that affect the use of any personally identifiable information we collect. We will not make new use of any personally identifiable information which SPOT.PH gathered from individual members or visitors prior to any such significant change in our Privacy Policy without first obtaining the member's or visitor's consent for any new uses. In instances where we ask for your personally identifiable information and we tell you the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with unaffiliated third parties, and in cases where a member, visitor or subscriber to SPOT.PH opts-in to share his/her information with third parties, those disclosures and opt-ins will override anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy. In addition, SPOT.PH reserves the right to make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that will not affect SPOT.PH 's use of a user's personally identifiable information at any time without any notice to you other than posting any such changes in a revised Privacy Policy on SPOT.PH. We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Policy to be sure you are familiar with the most current version. The Policy will include the most recent date in which any revision has been made. Please note that this Privacy Policy is also incorporated into SPOT.PH 's Terms of Service. <br><br>
					
					We frequently provide information and links to third-party advertisers or partners. Information on how to access the privacy practices of these third parties is included below as well.<br><br><br>
			  <b>Information that SPOT.PH collects</b><br><br>
			SPOT.PH gathers two basic types of information:<br><br>
				<ul>
				  <li><b>Information provided to SPOT.PH</b></li><br>
					In order to use many of SPOT.PH 's features, tools and services, we ask you to register to become a member. During this member registration process, we will ask for your personally identifiable information such as your name, mobile/phone number, email address, mailing address, zip code, country, gender, birthdate, age, member name and password. In addition, you may choose to provide SPOT.PH with additional information such as marital status, household income, education, and employment status.				  
					<br><br>
SPOT.PH uses the information it gathers for several purposes, such as to understand more about our audience's interests, to communicate with you and to give you a better experience when visiting SPOT.PH by personalizing tools, content, services and email messages (more details below). SPOT.PH also uses this information to build new services and develop offers that SPOT.PH believes are more relevant and valuable to you.
<br><br>
SPOT.PH, its advertisers and partners may ask you for information in order to provide you with access to goods, services and tools. When personally identifiable information provided by you is (i) collected by SPOT.PH and/or a SPOT.PH sponsor or partner or (ii) collected by SPOT.PH and shared with a SPOT.PH sponsor or partner, your permission will be obtained and you will be advised as to which privacy policy(ies) will control the collection and dissemination of the information provided if different from SPOT.PH 's policy.					<br><br>
  <li><b>Information gathered by SPOT.PH</b></li><br>
When you visit SPOT.PH and interact with the services and tools that reside there, SPOT.PH and third parties with whom SPOT.PH has contracted to provide services to SPOT.PH may collect information on your actions. This type of information is generally collected from two sources. One is from the server log files and the other is from cookies.
			  	</ul>
			  <br><br><br>
		 	<b>How information is collected and disseminated</b><br><br>
The information collected by SPOT.PH is used to create aggregated portraits of the SPOT.PH audience, portraits which present anonymous statistical demographic information but no personally identifiable information. This aggregated information is used, among other things, to determine trends and needs, and also to supply market research to potential advertisers and partners to help them understand who the SPOT.PH audience is. For example, we may create a report that tells advertisers that 60 percent of our members are females in a certain age range, so that they can determine which of their products or services are most appropriate for our members.			
<br><br>
In order to better describe how information is collected and disseminated, please carefully review the list below.<br><br>
			<ul>
				  <li>Membership Registration&gt;</li>
				  <li>Order Forms and Transactions with E-Commerce Partners And Advertisers</li>
				  <li>Electronic Newsletters and Reminders</li>
				  <li>Public Forums/Chat Rooms/Message Boards/Bulletin Boards</li>
				  <li>Surveys and Polls</li>
				  <li>Contests and promos </li>
				  <li>"Send This to a Friend" and Postcard Service</li>
				  <li>Links to Partner and Advertiser Sites</li>
				  <li>Information collected by SPOT.PH through IP address and cookies</li>
				  <li>Information Collected by Third Party Advertising Services</li>
				  <li>Information Sharing Policy</li>
				  <li>SPOT.PH Opt-in/Opt-out Policy</li>
				  <li>Change/Modify/Archived Information</li>
				  <li>How We Protect and Secure Your Information</li>
				  <li>Guidelines Regarding Children</li>
				  <li>Contact Information</li>
			</ul>
<br><br><br>
			<b>Membership registration</b><br><br>
			Many areas of SPOT.PH are reserved for SPOT.PH members who have registered with us; for example, chats, message boards and access to special services such as email, member pages, special offers and promos. This is necessary so that SPOT.PH can assure the quality of its forums. Registration is free.
<br><br>
The membership registration form currently requires you to choose a member name and password and provide SPOT.PH with your first and last names, email address, mailing address, zip code, country, gender, age and birthdate. The form also includes optional information that you may choose to provide to us like marital status, household income, education and employment status.
<br><br>
The personally identifiable information you provide during membership registration will not be given to unaffiliated third parties without your consent except in the limited circumstances described in the section of this Privacy Policy entitled "Information Sharing Policy".
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Order forms and transactions with e-commerce partners and advertisers</b>			<br><br>
		The information provided via order forms is generally shared with advertisers and partners on an aggregated basis. In the event that an advertiser or partner wishes to offer free samples, or provide information about products and services and to do so requires personally identifiable information, SPOT.PH will provide you with the ability to "opt-in" and will often provide you access to the Privacy Policy of the advertiser for your review via a link. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "opt-in" is generally defined as any affirmative action by a SPOT.PH member or visitor to submit or receive information, as the case may be. When you provide personal, financial, and other personally identifiable information to one of SPOT.PH 's e-commerce partners, this transaction will occur on the e-commerce partner's site, not SPOT.PH and as such the financial and personally identifiable information you provide is collected by and controlled by the Privacy Policy of that e-commerce partner. It is important therefore that you familiarize yourself with the Privacy Policy of the e-commerce site with which you transact business.<br><br><br>
		<b>Electronic newsletters and reminders</b>
		<br><br>
SPOT.PH offers free electronic newsletters on a variety of topics. If you choose to subscribe to any of these newsletters, currently the only information you will be required to provide is a valid email address. In order to receive these newsletters you must opt-in to receiving them. Generally, SPOT.PH does not share mailing lists from its electronic newsletters with third parties. However, in some situations, SPOT.PH may share its newsletter mailing lists with third parties who provide newsletter and/or reminder fulfillment services on behalf of SPOT.PH. In these instances, such third parties will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. Additionally, SPOT.PH may provide third parties with a list of SPOT.PH members and visitors who have opted-in to receiving additional information from third parties.
<br><br>
In those instances where you opt-in to subscribe to a newsletter through a third-party email service or advertiser or partner, the email address information sometimes will be located on the third party's server, in which case we generally will notify you. In those cases, any information you provide is subject to that entity's Privacy Policy, not this one. Some of our partners' and advertisers' sites require that you specifically opt-out from receiving their newsletters. As a result, to stop receiving them you will need to affirmatively opt-out from the third party newsletter.
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Public forums/chat rooms/message boards/message boards/bulletin boards</b><br><br>
Throughout SPOT.PH various public forums such as chat rooms, message boards, and various question and answer areas are available to you as a registered SPOT.PH member. Please remember that any information you disclose in these public forum areas becomes public information and is immediately accessible on SPOT.PH, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when deciding to reveal personal information and/or issuing your comments, feedback, and suggestions regarding a certain story or topic, or even photos. SPOT.PH may decide to utilize the content of forums, interactions with experts, and/or chat room and message board content throughout SPOT.PH and in promotions in order to enhance SPOT.PH 's editorial, advertising, promotional and similar activities. In those cases we often provide authorship credit by listing the author's member name. 		
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Surveys and polls</b><br><br>
		Our surveys ask for opinions on various issues and very often these surveys and polls are sponsored by or associated with SPOT.PH advertisers and partners. Occasionally, we may request demographic information (like address, age or gender). Most information obtained through surveys and polls is aggregated and used internally or shared with advertisers and partners only in the aggregated form. In the event personally identifiable information is requested as part of surveys or polls about any SPOT.PH member or subscriber, such personally identifiable information is never provided to unaffiliated third parties without your consent. In these instances you may expressly choose to receive information from a sponsor, in which case your information is provided to that sponsor only. Some survey answers may be added to your member portrait (so that we can better provide you with content, ads and offers that are most appropriate for you).
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Contests and other promos</b><br><br>
We regularly operate contests and other promos throughout SPOT.PH. We typically ask you for your email address and mobile/phone number (to notify you if you've won, or not). We also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses in order to verify the entrant's identity. In some situations, we need additional information as part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. This information is shared with an unaffiliated third party:		
		<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>When you choose to receive information from a third party promo sponsor;</li>
				<li>When a contest or promo is hosted by SPOT.PH but administered by a sponsor, again, we will advise you of this in the contest or promo rules; or</li>
				<li>Most contests and other promos will also ask you to consent to the release of information contained within the entry form for tax purposes if you become a winner.</li>
			</ul>
		<br><br>
You should carefully review the rules of each contest and promo which you enter as they may contain additional important information about SPOT.PH 's or a sponsor's use of your personally identifiable information.
<br><br><br>
<b>"Send this to a friend" and postcard service</b>		<br><br>
SPOT.PH offers the ability to forward content to another person via email or to send an electronic postcard. If you use either of these services, we will use the recipient's email address in order to send the content and we will also ask for your email address. In the case of postcards, we will ask for your email address and each may be stored so that we can ensure delivery and that the recipient can retrieve the postcard. We do not use the recipient's email address for any other purpose unless such recipient gives us permission to do so.
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Links to partner and advertiser sites</b><br><br>
SPOT.PH contains links to advertiser and partner websites. We cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such non- SPOT.PH websites, and we do not control the practices of any of our advertisers or partners to whom we are linked. However, we generally will advise you when you are leaving SPOT.PH through a link, and when that advertiser's or partner's Privacy Policy controls the collection and dissemination of the information you provide.
<br><br>
In order to participate in the partner and/or advertiser supplied services and tools you may be required to provide personally identifiable information to the advertisers and partners whose tools and services you have chosen to interact with. Each advertiser and partner will request different information from you.
<br><br>
In any instance where personally identifiable information is required to be provided to or shared with SPOT.PH advertisers and partners, SPOT.PH generally will advise you when such advertiser or partner will receive your personally identifiable information, and further advise you as to which Privacy Policy will control the collection and dissemination of personally identifiable information you provide. SPOT.PH will use commercially reasonable efforts to contractually require all such third party advertisers and partners to agree to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
The information you provide via links to co-branded pages, co-branded sites, third party sites or tools may be shared with advertisers and partners on an aggregated basis and in these instances your permission will not be requested since no personally identifiable information will be shared or provided to these third party sponsors or advertisers. SPOT.PH will, however, use commercially reasonable efforts to contractually require all such third party advertisers and partners to agree not to use any non-personally identifiable information about you, in conjunction with other sources of information, or otherwise, to identify you.
<br><br>
If you have additional questions about how one of our advertisers, partners or sponsors use information about you, we urge you to contact them directly.
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Information sharing policy</b><br><br>
SPOT.PH does not sell or otherwise share personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties without your consent except in the following instances: (i) unless required by applicable law or pursuant to a court or similar order; (ii) as deemed necessary, in SPOT.PH 's discretion, to protect the legal rights or the property of SPOT.PH, a member or third party, or to prevent personal injury; and/or (iii) in the event SPOT.PH is required to transfer personally identifiable information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of SPOT.PH or its affiliated entities (including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). In addition, SPOT.PH reserves the right to allow access to its systems to third parties providing necessary technical services when such access is required in order to provide those services and to provide your personally identifiable information to third parties who provide services on behalf of SPOT.PH, provided that such third parties are bound by SPOT.PH 's Privacy Policy. Please note, however, that SPOT.PH reserves the right to share any personally identifiable or other information about you which you provide to (or which is gathered by) SPOT.PH with any or all of its subsidiaries and affiliates, and will also have access to any such information which you provide to (or which is gathered by) the web sites of any of our Affiliates.		
		<br><br><br>
		<b>SPOT.PH opt-in/opt-out policy</b>		<br><br>
Upon registration or from time-to-time, you may be asked to indicate whether you are interested in receiving information from us about special offers or news about our sites and advertisers. You will also be provided with the opportunity to opt-in to receive offers directly from select companies other than SPOT.PH. If you do choose to receive these communications by means of an opt-in, we will occasionally send you an email message that matches your request(s). You may, of course, always choose not to receive any of this information from us using the opt-out opportunities provided. 
<br><br>
Please note that SPOT.PH reserves the right to contact you in the event of a change in the SPOT.PH Terms of Service and/or this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
At any time, you can opt out of having your personally identifiable information shared with our Affiliates for their direct marketing purposes.
<br><br><br>
<b>Change/modify/archive information</b>		<br><br>
SPOT.PH provides you with the ability to access, correct or change certain information in your member portrait at any time, including contact information or other information you've provided to us. However, you cannot currently change your member name although you may re-register and choose a new name. Please be advised that SPOT.PH currently archives information it collects on its members and visitors.
<br><br><br>
<b>How we protect and secure your information</b><br><br>
SPOT.PH has numerous security measures in place to protect you from the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control, including your credit card information if you choose to conduct an e-commerce transaction on SPOT.PH. All of your member information, as well as other sensitive areas like your free SPOT.PH email account, require use of your password. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone.
<br><br>
SPOT.PH uses industry-standard tools, such as firewalls, to ensure that your information is secure and confidential.
<br><br><br>
<b>Guidelines regarding children</b><br><br>
Personal information about children is a concern for all of us. At SPOT.PH, we take the protection of children's privacy very seriously. SPOT.PH does not encourage participation or visitation by children. Visitors who are known to be under the age of 13 are prohibited from becoming a member. Anyone under the age of eighteen is discouraged from participating in any sex related chats or message boards and we ask that no one less than eighteen years of age become a community volunteer.
