		<li><h3>Security</h3>
		<p>This website takes every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via this website, your information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
		  <p>When our registration and financial processing forms ask you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or birth date), that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry - 128 bit SSL. While on a secure page such as our credit card form, the lock icon on the bottom of your web browser becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://www.ssl.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">http://www.ssl.com</a>.</p>
		  <p> While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect your information off-line. Your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.</p>

You will have a choice as to whether or not to allow us to use your information in this different manner.
