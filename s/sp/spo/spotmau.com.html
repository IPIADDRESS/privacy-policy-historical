Depending on the Services that you order, the Spotmau Software may allow us to temporarily take control of your computer and modify your computer settings to resolve your personal technology problem . For other Services, the Spotmau Software will report non-personal information about your PC's performance and configuration to you and to Spotmau. For such Services, the Spotmau Software will run on a regular basis, but only after you elect to run the Spotmau Software and report your PC information to yourself and to Spotmau. In every instance, Spotmau will solely use the Spotmau Software and the information that it provides to attempt to identify and resolve your existing and potential personal technology problem(s) and use reasonable efforts to limit its access of your Personal Information while performing the Services and only after you have given us permission to do so. However, in the course of providing the Services to you, Spotmau may inadvertently see, access, or being exposed to Personal Information on your computer.
