<p>
We at Spongecell, Inc. (“Spongecell,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Spongecell in connection with information collected through our website located at www.spongecell.com (the “Site”), the services provided through the Site (the “Services”), and the ad units used to promote our clients products or services that are served by the Services (the “Ad Units”).
</p>
<p>
By visiting the Site, using the Service, and/or interacting with any Ad Unit, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use . Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings set forth in the Terms of Use.
</p>

<h4>
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
</h4>
</header>
<p>
<em>
Personally Identifiable Information
</em>
<br>
We do not collect any personal information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us.
When you sign up to become a registered user of the Site or a Service, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information, such as your first name, last name and email address. In some cases, you may be asked to provide this information if you interact with an Ad Unit. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all of this information as “Personally Identifiable Information.”
</p>
<p>
<em>
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
</em>
<br>
Like most web sites, we use automatic data collection technology when you visit the Site or interact with our Ad Units that records information that your browser collects. . We collect non-personally identifiable data from the Site, from our Ad Units, from third-party vendors, and from client websites on which our technology has been placed. This information includes information about your operating system, your IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, keywords, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of a website you visit, and similar information concerning your use of the Site and the Service (the “Usage Information”). We also collect this information when you
interact with an Ad Unit.
</p>
<p>
We collect this Usage Information by using cookies. Cookies are small packets of data that a web site stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web site users. You can reject cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet provider’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still visit the Site, but may not be able to use some areas of the Site and/or the Service. You will still receive our Ad Units, but we will not use information that we have gathered to personalize the Ad Unit content for you. Automatic data collection may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.
</p>
<p>
We may also allow third-party companies that are presenting advertisements on the Site to set and access their own cookies. Such third-party cookies are not governed by this Privacy Policy, but by the privacy policies of such third party. You can opt-out of receiving cookies from third-party data providers by following the instructions at: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
</p>
<p>
If you do not want us to gather non-personally identifiable information when you encounter our Ad Units, please <a href="http://spongecell.com/opt_out/cookies_form">click here</a>. The opt–out works by placing a cookie on your browser that notifies us that no other Spongecell cookies should be placed on the applicable browser. We do not use Flash Cookies. The opt–out does not mean that you will no longer see Spongecell advertisements. It means only that Ad Units delivered by Spongecell will not be personalized to you based on information derived from cookies placed by us or our third-party vendors.
</p>
<p>
Because your choices are not associated with you as a particular individual, but rather with the browser you are using, if you change computers, web browsers or cookie settings, you will need to re-implement your preferences as described above.

<p>
We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, hosting services, and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of such information and use such information only as necessary to provide us with designated services.
If we or all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personally identifying information, would be transferred along with our other business assets.
</p>
<p>
We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information or non-Personally Identifiable Information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose your this information when we have reason to believe that someone is or may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of this Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
