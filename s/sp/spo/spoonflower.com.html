    <p>Spoonflower may use non-personally-identifiable data about use of the Spoonflower web site and services to improve the quality and design of our web site and services and we may track and analyze user preferences and trends to create new functions, promotions and services for the Spoonflower web site.  We may provide non-personally-identifiable, aggregated and statistical data about our users and use of our web site and services to third parties for such purposes as Spoonflower may deem appropriate from time to time. </p>

    <h2 id="e_mail_communications">E-mail Communications</h2>

    <p>We will never provide your email address to an unaffiliated third party without your explicit permission, but we may use third party service providers who work on behalf of or with Spoonflower to provide services to you, which third parties may be granted access to your email address and other information in order to provide the services.  For example, we use MailChimp, a third-party service, to maintain and administer our beta-tester list. We require that these parties agree to use such information solely for the purposes of providing Spoonflower's services and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use or access to such information. </p>

    <p>Spoonflower may send out e-mails with news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. You may also receive notification e-mails from Spoonflower which inform you of actions (e.g. friend requests) that have been performed on the site. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please visit the Email Preferences section of your Profile and/or follow the instructions contained in the unwanted e-mail message. However, please note that in all cases you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us.</p>

    <h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our web site are visited and by how many people. Spoonflower cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is. We may use cookies to remember who you are when you next visit our web site, provide a custom, personalized experience on our web site and monitor the success of marketing or promotional campaigns and aggregate metrics. </li>
      <li>The “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use our Site - and others - as designed.</li>
      <li>We have no access to, or control over, cookies stored on your computer by third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sharing_your_information">Sharing Your Information</h2>

    <p>Because Spoonflower enables people to discover and share designs with one another, information about the people who use Spoonflower is an important part of our community. Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell your personal information to any unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes and that we will share your personal information only as described below.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Spoonflower employees: Spoonflower personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to member information in the normal course of Spoonflower business.  We require that our employees and consultants or contractors access and use such information only as required to provide the Spoonflower services and do not share such information with unauthorized third parties. </li>
      <li>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Spoonflower, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, member information would be one of the assets that is transferred.</li>
      <li>Protection of Spoonflower and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Spoonflower, our employees, our members, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction and investigating or protecting against intellectual property infringement.</li>
      <li>User Profile information: Information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be displayed to other Spoonflower users in your Profile. The Profile is the area on Spoonflower where we allow you to tell other community members about yourself and your interests. You may control what personal information is displayed in your Profile by visiting the Privacy Settings section of your Profile.</li>
      <li>Member Directory: The e-mail address that you submit upon registration will be searchable by other Spoonflower users who know you by your email address, unless you choose to opt out of this feature. This is primarily so that other users can find you to establish friendships through Spoonflower. You may opt-out of this feature by visiting the Privacy Settings section of your Profile.</li>
      <li>Social sharing of data: Spoonflower allows you to display your designs on your own blogs or on other sites and networks. The ability to do this is available via your User Profile, or within the permalink URL of the design you wish to share. Spoonflower may choose to post this data on other site features.</li>
      <li>Friends’ Activity: Much like other online social networks, Spoonflower will allow non-friends to browse your friends’ activity.</li>
      <li>Syndication: Spoonflower will allow for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the Spoonflower web site.</li>
      <li>With Your Consent: Except as noted above, we will contact you when your personal information is shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of this information.</li>
    </ul>
