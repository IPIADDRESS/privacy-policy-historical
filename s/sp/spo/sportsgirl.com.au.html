            <p>Sportsgirl is committed to supporting the 'National Privacy Principles 
              for the Fair Handling of Personal Information' which has set clear 
              standards and guidelines for the collection, access, storage and 
              use of personal information which Sportsgirl may obtain during the 
              course of our business operations.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy sets out matters of which you should be aware 
              regarding information we may collect about you, our policies on 
              the management of personal information and generally, what sort 
              of information we hold, for what purposes and how we collect, hold, 
              use and disclose that information <br>
            </p>
            <p><b>The information we collect<br>
              </b> </p>
            <p>In order to provide services to you, we may ask for personal details 
              such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address. 
              Some examples of where we may need these details are; lay-bys, remote 
              area purchase through telephone, suppliers’ after hours contact 
              details or in-store competitions. Privacy law requires Sportsgirl 
              to collect personal information about you directly from you if it 
              is reasonable and practical to do so.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Generally, you have no obligation to provide any information requested 
              by Sportsgirl. If you choose to withhold requested information however, 
              we may not be able to provide you with the service you require should 
              that depend on the collection of that information, particularly 
              if the collection of that information is required by law.<br>
            </p>
            <p>We do not collect sensitive information about you unless required 
              by applicable laws or rules. Sensitive information includes information 
              relating to:<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>•</i> race <br>
              <i>•</i> political or religious beliefs <br>
              <i>•</i> sexual preferences <br>

              unions <br>
              <i>•</i> health information<br>
            </p>
            <p><b>How that information is used</b><br>
            </p>
            <p>The personal information that we seek is generally used for the 
              specific purpose of being of service to you. For example; name and 
              contact address for a lay-by account or card number for a credit 
              card transaction or name and contact details for participating in 
              a competition. <br>
              We do not use or share personal information for any purpose other 
              than for the purpose for which it was disclosed. We do not provide 
              or sell personal information to other organisations. However we 
              may disclose personal information to our service providers who provide 
              services in connection with our products and services. <br>

              <b>Keeping information accurate and up to date</b><br>
            </p>

              hold is as accurate as is possible. You are able to contact us at
