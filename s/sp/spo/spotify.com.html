			<div class="contentbox overviewbox last"><h1>Spotify Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Effective as from 12 December 2011.</p>
<p>Spotify USA Inc., a Delaware corporation (“<strong>Spotify</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”)
wishes to bring you the best music service available. To be able to do this, and to offer you products and
services described on the Spotify websites at <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">http://www.spotify.com/</a> and other Spotify branded URLs
(the “<strong>Spotify Websites</strong>”). Spotify will request some information from you and automatically collect
information about your use of the Spotify Software Application, the Spotify Service (both as defined
in the <a href="/us/legal/end-user-agreement/">Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use</a>). Further, Spotify will request information from third
party services if such services are activated via Spotify. This policy (the “<strong>Spotify Privacy Policy</strong>”)
describes our online privacy practices and what personal information we may collect from you and what
we will and will not do with that information.</p>

<h2>1. How we collect and use personal information</h2>
<p>When you sign up for a Spotify account or purchase Spotify’s products and services described on the <a href="/us/">Spotify Websites</a>, we may ask you for
certain personal information such as
email address, postal address, age, gender and residence. When creating a Spotify account, or connecting your already existing Spotify account with your Facebook account, we will
also receive and store the following information from Facebook, Inc. (“<strong>Facebook</strong>”) your name, user name, password, profile picture, unique Facebook
identifier and access token, gender, birthday and email address. In addition, when you use the Spotify Software Application, Spotify Service and Spotify Websites, we will
automatically receive information about your use of the application, service and website including information such as media that you access, queries you make, date and
time of your request, your Internet protocol address, performance of your network and computer, your browser type, language and identifying information, your operating system and
application version.</p>
<p>We will use your personal information (i) to provide the products and services that you have purchased or requested (including Spotify Social, as defined in the
<a href="/us/legal/end-user-agreement/">Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use</a>, and the display of customized content and advertising), (ii) to communicate with you concerning
your account, customer service issues and Spotify products and services, (iii) to personalize and improve the Spotify Software Application, the Spotify Service and the Spotify Websites,
(iv) to ensure the technical functioning of our products and services, (v) to develop new products and services, (vi) to protect the copyright-protected content of the Spotify Service (e.g.
by limiting access to the Spotify Service content to users with a Spotify account), and (vii) as otherwise stated in this Spotify Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you connect your Spotify account to Facebook, we will make available and/or share your Facebook user name and your Facebook profile picture to other Spotify users. Further, Spotify
users may be able to use the Spotify Service to search for or view your Spotify profile and the information contained therein, such as Playlists, as defined below (for example, if they
know and input your user name in the Spotify Software Application or Spotify Service).  Please familiarize yourself with and use the settings in the preferences pane as they provide you
with some options to adjust the information in your Spotify profile that may be viewed and your activities that may be shared.</p>
<p>If you choose to activate Spotify Social or otherwise publish your playlists, starred music top lists, and current playing song (hereafter jointly “<strong>Playlists</strong>”),
your Playlist information will be publicly available to other Spotify users (for example, on your Spotify profile page or social activity stream) and may be used,  or re-shared by other Spotify
users.  Spotify is not responsible for the use or re-sharing of Playlist information by others once it is made public.  If you do not wish for such use or re-sharing of this type of data taking
place going forward, you should not activate Spotify Social and/or adjust your settings and listening mode.</p>

<h2>2. Sharing information with others</h2>
<p>Unless you give us your explicit approval and except as outlined in Section 1 above and except with respect to, Spotify affiliates (being other companies controlled by or under common control with us), we will only share your personal information for the purposes set forth under Section 1 (i) to (vii) above or as is necessary to:</p>
<ol class="roman-list">
	<li>
		Enforce the terms and conditions of the <a href="/us/legal/end-user-agreement/">Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use</a>, <a href="/us/legal/mobile-terms-and-conditions/">the Mobile Terms</a> (as defined in the <a href="/us/legal/end-user-agreement/">Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use</a>), <a href="/us/legal/premium-code-terms-and-conditions/">the Premium Code Terms</a> and <a href="/us/legal/unlimited-code-terms-and-conditions/">the Unlimited Code Terms</a>.
	</li>
	<li>Comply with laws, regulations and any applicable court orders or to respond to requests from governmental or administrative bodies or to comply with litigation matters or other legal process.</li>
	<li>Allow for a change of ownership of Spotify (including but not limited to an acquisition by or merger with another company) and related transfer of all personal information to the new owner in which case any information remains protected in accordance with this Spotify Privacy Policy.</li>
	<li>Allow advertising audits and analysis measuring the size and composition of the group of users that have listened to and/or viewed an advertisement or other promotional information.</li>
	<li>Allow us to use a third party to perform surveys measuring your experiences and use of our services (not permitting the third party to use your personal information for any other purpose).</li>
	<li>Allow us to share aggregated statistics about use of the Spotify Software Application and the Spotify Service with parties with whom we do business.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have connected your Spotify account to Facebook, we will share with Facebook information related to your use of the Spotify Service, such as the music you listen to or Playlists, and such
information may be published on Facebook’s websites or services. .You can choose to disable automatic publishing on Facebook of what you are listening to in the preferences pane. Information shared
to Facebook will be attributed to the Facebook account to which your Spotify account is connected. Facebook’s use of such information and any information it collects from your use of or on its service
is governed by Facebook’s privacy policy and Spotify’s use of information is governed by this Spotify Privacy Policy. You understand and agree that you need to consult both privacy policies to amend or
delete personal information which has been provided to Facebook.If you do not wish for such use of data to take place, you should not agree to share information about the music you play to Facebook
and/or adjust your settings to deactivate such sharing. Information no longer shared on Facebook may continue to be publicly available to other Spotify users (for example, using other Spotify social
features) or via the Spotify Service as otherwise described in this Spotify Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Providers of Third Party Applications (as defined in the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use) may require you to provide your personal information to access their Third Party Applications. In such
cases, you will be informed about this either during the registration process, in the terms of use or privacy policy of the Third Party Application, by requiring you to login or register, or in a
similar manner. Further, if you visit or register for a Third Party Application, information as to your Spotify user id, currently playing song, play history, play queue, library, playlists, country
of registration and type of subscription (e.g. Free Service, Unlimited Service or Premium Service) may be transferred to, used and stored by the provider of the Third Party Application. Spotify may
also collect and share information as to your physical location, with a provider of a Third Party Application, however, we will not use that information to determine your precise location, without
your prior consent. The Third Party Application provider’s use of your personal information is governed by that third party’s privacy policy, and Spotify’s use is governed by this Spotify Privacy Policy.
Please note that if you choose to remove a Third Party Application from your Spotify account, this does not necessarily mean that the relevant third party provider will delete personal information that
they have received. Please visit the privacy policy of the relevant third party to make sure that you understand how they use the personal information you provide to them. If you do not wish for such
use of your personal data taking place, you should not register for or use the applicable Third Party Application.</p>
<p>In some further cases, access to certain other third party products and services which are offered or advertised through the Spotify Software Application or the Spotify Website may also require you
to provide your personal information to third parties, such as our business partners. In such cases, this will be stated during the registration process, in the terms of use or privacy policy, by
requiring you to login or register, or in a similar manner. The third party’s use of such information is governed by that party’s privacy policy, and Spotify’s use is governed by this Spotify Privacy
Policy. Please visit the privacy policy of our business partners’ to make sure that you understand how they use the personal information you provide to them. If you do not wish for such use of your
personal data taking place, you should not register for the applicable product or service.</p>

<h2>3. Transfer of personal information to other countries</h2>
<p>Spotify processes personal information on servers in a number of countries. We may therefore transfer and process your personal information on a server outside the United States. However, we will use our best efforts to do so in accordance with this Spotify Privacy Policy and applicable law. By approving the Spotify Privacy Policy, you consent to such transfer of your personal information.</p>

<h2>4. Security</h2>
<p>We take a number of steps to keep your personal information secure from unauthorized access. For example, we ask you to use a unique and strong password and not to share this information with anyone. In addition, we use encrypted transmissions to limit access to the systems that store your personal information. Further, we respect and comply with applicable laws and regulations on data protection.  You are responsible for maintaining the security of your user access name and related password. While we try our best to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, please be aware that no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
