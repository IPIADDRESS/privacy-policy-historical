        The internet brings new risks that must also be recognized and guarded against.
        We use industry standard security technology and practices, focusing on three key
        areas - privacy, technology and identification so we can safeguard accounts from
        any unauthorized access. Our companies use industry standard encryption within our
        Organization. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology will be used within the Internet
        lending session to encrypt the information to provide protection from unwanted disclosure.
        Depending on your browser settings, a pop-up window may appear to tell you that
        you are entering a secure page. We use many layers of security - for obvious reasons
        we cannot disclose all of them, but they include updating our operating systems
        are with the latest security patches along with our anti-virus software and using
        firewalls to prevent unauthorized intruders.</p>
    <h4>
        <span class="caps">PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</span></h4>
    <p>
        You play an important role in protecting your information. There are a number of
        tips for making certain your personal information is protected.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Regular email is not secure, so don't use email to send confidential account information.
            Instead, use the "Contact Us" link on our web site to send secure messages to our
            company.</li><li>We recommend that you use a recent version of either Microsoft Internet
                Explorer, Mozilla Fireforx or Netscape Navigator/Communicator to access our web
                site. These browsers support the latest encryption and will help to ensure that
                your connection to our site is secure.</li><li>Choose passwords that are difficult for
                    others to guess. Don't use your personal information such as your birth date or
                    pet's name as a password. Keep your passwords for each account unique, and don't
                    write your passwords down in a place where others could find them.</li><li>Secure your
                        computer by using anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software. Also, make sure
                        that you keep your operating system up to date and install the latest security patches.</li><li>
                            Remember that our company will never ask for personal information such as passwords
                            and account numbers through email.</li><li>Be on the lookout! If you notice anything
                                suspicious, please contact our company immediately.<br>
                            </li>
        <li>It's a good idea to check your credit report at least once a year to make sure there
            is no unauthorized activity. See below for information on obtaining a free credit
            report.</li></ol>
