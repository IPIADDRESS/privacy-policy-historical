  <h2 id="WhatCollect">What Is Collected</h2>
  
  <h3>Part 1: <em>Personal Information</em></h3>
  
  <p>Personal Information generally means information that might reasonably be used to specifically identify you and may include information such as your name, address, email and phone number. This Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information that we receive, regardless of how it is gathered or stored. We collect such Personal Information when you provide it to us, such as when you:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Purchase a software license or a product;</li>
    <li>Sign up for emails, bulletins, newsletters, webinars or white papers;</li>
    <li>Enter a sweepstakes, contest, competition or prize draw;</li>
    <li>Register for site membership or create a profile on any of our sites;</li>
    <li>Participate in surveys;</li>
    <li>Host Ookla's Speedtest or Pingtest application or use such application on your desktop or through an app; or</li>
    <li>Otherwise communicate with us.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Several of the services that we offer require registration as a condition of use. We may also receive Personal Information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.</p>
  
  <h3 id="TechInfoCollected">Part 2: <em>Other Information That is Collected</em></h3>
  
  <p><strong><em>Cookies</em></strong> are small text files that are placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited. Please see our <a href="http://www.ziffdavis.com/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a> for more information, including a more in-depth explanation of what cookies are, the different types of cookies used on Ziff Davis sites, and how to change or delete them.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Log Files.</em></strong> As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol ("IP") addresses, browser type, internet service provider ("ISP"), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Web Beacons</em></strong> are electronic files that allow a website to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. When you receive email messages or newsletters from us, we may use web beacons, customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused email communications or other information.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Pixel Tags</em></strong> also known as clear GIFs, beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, are a method for passing information from the user's computer to a third party website. Used in conjunction with cookies, Ziff Davis may use pixel tags to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns. Pixel tags are also used as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement, and they are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications. We may also implement pixel tags provided by other companies for the same purpose. We use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Local Shared Objects / Local Storage ("LSOs"/LS's)</em></strong> are found in technologies such as HTML5 or Flash to store user settings and video viewing history. Ziff Davis and Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use HTML5—or Flash—based LSOs to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please click <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">here</a>.</p>
  
  <p id="IPAddresses"><strong><em>IP Addresses</em></strong> are a unique string of numbers that identifies each computer attached to the Internet. We use IP Addresses to analyze trends, administer our websites, track users' location, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may connect information about your IP Address to known corporate information and use associated information related to aggregate content preferences to assist in our efforts to market business-to-business services to the originating corporation or corporations. IP Addresses that we collect are sometimes linked to personally identifiable information. We use registration and email addresses that you provide together with IP Addresses and other information that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy. By combining the information, we are better able to understand our users and to better market services and products to our users.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Device ID (identification)</em></strong> is a distinctive number associated with a smartphone or similar handheld device. Device IDs are different than hardware serial numbers. iOS uses the Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) and Android uses Advertising ID. Some of our apps and mobile sites may create a unique device ID for your smartphone or other mobile device using our own algorithm. We use Device IDs— either our own, IDFA or Advertising ID—to analyze trends, administer our mobile sites and apps, track mobile users' location, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may connect information about a visitor's Device ID with other information we gather about that visitor as described in this Privacy Policy. By combining the information, we are better able to understand our users and to better market services and products to our users.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Mobile Analytics.</em></strong> We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Third Parties.</em></strong> To improve the quality of some of our services, we may supplement the information we collect with information from third parties. For example, if you access My IGN (my.ign.com) using a third party connection or log-in (such as Google+, Facebook or Yahoo!), we may also collect your user ID, username or email address associated with that third party service or any information you have made public in connection with that service or the third party shares with us.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Speedtest—Broadband Performance Data Services.</em></strong> When using our Speedtest application, we collect test results, approximate location of the server and user machine (using publicly available information and if made available by your mobile device) as well as the network address and the ISP, college or organization that operates the network you test. The information we collect via the broadband and mobile performance tests run on the Speedtest app, speedtest.net or pingtest.net is done so anonymously and is then aggregated for a few different broadband performance data services. We do so with the express intent of providing a neutral and unbiased monitoring and reporting resource for users around the world. This anonymous, aggregated data can be accessed via subscription services or via our publicly-available data repository, currently called NetIndex.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Social Media Widgets.</em></strong> Our websites include social media features, such as the Facebook "Like" button and widgets, which include the "Share This" button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites. These features may collect your IP Address, track which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the features to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our sites. <strong>Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Online Ad Serving.</em></strong> Ziff Davis and some of our advertisers use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements when you visit our sites or use our apps. Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookie, pixel tag and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of Web, app and email advertisement and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or apps, or for reporting website traffic, app use. statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on our sites. We will also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data. [Ziff Davis and/or these third party advertisers may collect non-Personal Information about you for online behavioral advertising (OBA) purposes—which includes mobile devices and apps—in order for you to receive relevant interest-based advertising from us in the future but see below <a href="#AdServing">Interest-Based Ads</a> for more information on OBA. <strong>The specific providers we use are subject to change.</strong></p>
  
  <p>For a list of the applicable providers, <a href="http://info.evidon.com/pub_info/8?v=1&amp;iptvn=0">click here</a>. For information about how to opt out of tracking methods for these entities and others, <a href="#ChangeAndControl">click here</a>.</p>
  
  <h2 id="WhatWeProvideTo3dParties">What We Provide to Third Parties</h2>
  
  <p><strong><em>Statistical Reports and Mailing List.</em></strong> The aggregate statistics that describe our online audience—which are often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse our sites—help us sell advertising by, among other things, describing the demographics of our visitors, and otherwise publicize Ziff Davis and our brands. In addition, we make some information collected by other parts of Ziff Davis, such as the name of our users, their mailing address, phone number, email address—and in certain circumstances their employer's name, company size and other industry data—available on a rental or other basis (e.g. sale) to third party providers of goods and services when such information is provided in connection with webcasts and white papers or other sponsored downloads. To learn how you can make choices about how this information is used or shared, please visit the <a href="#ChangeAndControl">How You Can Change or Control What is Collected</a> section below.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Email Deployment, Data Analysis, E-Commerce, and Other Services.</em></strong> We provide customer lists, email addresses and other information to third party companies and contractors who provide us with specialized services, such as email message deployment, merge-purge (identifying and removing duplicate addresses), subscription fulfillment, customer support and service, research, statistical analysis, data and website hosting, and other data and transaction processing. These companies work on our behalf, and we do not provide our lists or other data to them for their own permanent use. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the information they need to deliver the service. They should also maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
  
  <p>Please note that we engage third party service providers for the purpose of processing the sale of subscriptions, to fulfill your orders for product purchases, to honor your request to be removed from promotional mailings, or other services. These service providers have access to or are provided with certain Personal Information (including credit card information) in order to provide us with the applicable service.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Contests, Competitions, Sweepstakes and Prize Draws.</em></strong> Data collected during the registration for contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws is used by us and may be shared with sponsors. Please read the contest rules carefully before you submit your data.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Co-Branded Sites and Services.</em></strong> When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of Ziff Davis), or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the information collected back to that partner. Use of your information by such partners is subject to their privacy policies as well as ours.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Speedtest Results.</em></strong> We license the results from all tests run through our Ookla brand—including pingtest.com—to third parties.</p>
  
  <p id="OnlineData"><strong><em>Online Data.</em></strong> All "Online Data" is collected anonymously provided, however, data collected on <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/">Speedtest.net</a> is not anonymous as follows: Ookla collects users' IP Addresses as described in the <a href="#IPAddresses">above section</a>. Ookla licenses the online data collected on <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/">Speedtest.net</a> to various companies around the world, including IP addresses and results from the speed tests taken. In most cases, the IP addresses are masked or partially hidden, but in some cases we provide the full IP address to the company licensing the information. In the cases in which we provide the full IP address, it is because the company, typically an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or mobile carrier, owns those IP addresses and provides them to their customers when their customers enter into a service contract. Because the company owns the IP address, we provide that full information to those companies when they specifically request that information.</p>
  <p>See below under <a href="#AdServing">Interest-based Ads</a> for other data that we may sell, license or transfer to third parties.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>E-commerce.</em></strong> When shopping on some of our sites or pages, users may need to provide personally identifiable information that is necessary to fulfill an online order, including name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, email address, credit card number (with expiration date), and any of the above information needed to send a package to a gift recipient. If a user creates an account, the credit card information above will not be stored under their account. When placing an order, credit card information will be immediately entered onto a secure server of a PCI-compliant third party. We partner with a number of third parties to process and fulfill orders, send transactional emails, collect payment/credit card information and ensure delivery of downloads and packages. While these third parties may have access to Personal Information in order to perform their duties, they are not permitted to use it for other purposes.</p>
  
  <h2 id="WhatZiffDavis">What Ziff Davis does with the Information It Collects</h2>
  
  <p><strong><em>Personal Information.</em></strong> How we use Personal Information is described in the section <a href="#WhatWeProvideTo3dParties">What We Provide to Third Parties</a>.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Emails.</em></strong> We use email addresses to send offers of services or products (and as set forth in the section <a href="#WhatWeProvideTo3dParties">What We Provide to Third Parties</a>). Any recipient will be able to unsubscribe from receiving these emails by following the instructions at the bottom of the email.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Other Information: Ad Serving and Ziff Davis.</em></strong> At times we display ads both on our network of owned and operated websites and apps and on non-Ziff Davis websites and apps. When you visit one of our websites, use one of our apps or view ads that we serve off of our network elsewhere, you may see multiple kinds of ads, such as text ads next to search results and graphical ads shown on web pages and apps. Sometimes these ads are based on the content of the page on which they appear. Other times these ads are generated by matching the ad to your interests as inferred from your browsing activities collected online; or the ads may be based on your location using your IP address and/or browser—see <a href="#AdServing">Interest-based Ads</a> below. Either way, Ziff Davis tries to show you relevant ads, and to do so, we may use information we know or receive about you, such as your browsing habits, gender, location or interests.</p>
  
  <p id="AdServing"><strong><em>Interest-based Ads.</em></strong> We use cookies, Javascript, pixel tags, Device ID tracking and other technology to collect information about (i) your visit to our sites, your engagement with our apps and other third party partner websites and apps that we do not own or operate but with whom we have agreements and (ii) your interaction with emails we deliver ("<a href="#OnlineData">Online Data</a>"). We analyze what pages you visit on our sites and the third party sites, what products or services you view, and whether you view or click on ads that are shown to you. We use this information to send you interest-based ads. All such data is also collected anonymously, and is aggregated with other data we collect and/or similar data collected by partners to create segments, groups of users and certain general-interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on (a) demographic or interest data, and a general geographic location derived from your IP Address or mobile device, (b) the pages you view and links you click when viewing an email or using our sites and services and those of our partners, and/or (c) the search terms you enter when using certain search services. We use this information to get a more accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are more relevant to your interests.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Please note that we may sell or transfer <a href="#OnlineData">Online Data</a> to certain third parties such as advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests, and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of this information. Some of these third parties may combine the <a href="#OnlineData">Online Data</a> with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.</strong></p>
  
  <p>We store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad personalization targeting separately from your contact information or other data that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address), which we obtained as described above under <a href="#WhatCollect">Personal Information</a>—however in some situations we combine the <a href="#OnlineData">Online Data</a> with your email address.</p>
  
  <p>We will engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of <a href="#OnlineData">Online Data</a>; and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. These efforts do not result in the collection of personally identifiable information such as name or address; and we do not intentionally collect data that we consider to be sensitive, such as financial, health, or medical information or data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or sex life. Except as may be set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, this <a href="#OnlineData">Online Data</a> is retained for not more than 180 days after which it shall expire. However, the 180 day period may commence again if the same user subsequently visits one of our sites or a partner's site.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>To ease future form filing.</em></strong> Some of our services use a registered user's data to "pre-populate" online forms that are displayed for the purpose of collecting additional individual data by our websites, selected third party sites, and/or sponsors and advertisers.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Behavioral Targeting/Re-Targeting.</em></strong> We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners may use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our owned and operated sites and third party websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.

  <p><strong><em>Digital Advertising Alliances.</em></strong> The <a href="http://www.digitaladvertisingalliance.org">Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</a> is an independent non-profit organization that collaborates with businesses, public policy groups, and public officials to ensure that the high standards for consumer privacy, transparency and control are addressed and enforced.</p>
  
  <p>Ziff Davis supports and adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the DAA and is a member of the DAA in the US, EU and Canada and has Ghostery, Inc.'s assurance platform to comply with these Principles. As part of this service, online ads that we place using behavioral data we collect are expected to be delivered with the Advertising Option Icon (also referred to as the <em>Forward i</em>) or similar icon that helps users understand how their data is being used and provides choices for users who want more control. Online advertisements on our sites targeted to you based on previously collected <a href="#OnlineData">Online Data</a> about you by third parties should also have the Advertising Option Icon. This icon is also on each of our web pages. The Advertising Option icon provides information (and links to other information) on online behavioral ads, who is collecting and using your online data, how you can opt out and more.</p>

  <p>Ziff Davis operates websites hosted in the United States and, depending on your country of residence, the submission of personally identifiable information to our sites may involve some transfer of Personal Information to the United States.

You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not provide protections equivalent to those of your country of residence.</p>
  
  <h2 id="Other">Other Useful Information Regarding Your Privacy</h2>
  
  <p><strong><em>Change of Ownership of Ziff Davis.</em></strong> Some or all Personal Information maintained by Ziff Davis may be subject to transfer to another company in the event of a change of ownership of Ziff Davis or sale of any part of Ziff Davis. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our websites of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Security</em></strong> We believe we use reasonable precautions to keep the Personal Information you disclose to our websites secure and to only release this information to third parties that share our commitment to privacy. However, we cannot guarantee there will not be a breach, and we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of any third parties. In certain instances we may use Secure Sockets Layer encryption on anonymous data.</p>
  
  <p>You are ultimately responsible for the security of your email address and password. Please take care when using and storing them. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.

  <p><strong><em>Data Retention.</em></strong> The time period for which we keep information varies according to the information's use. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary to fulfill a legitimate business need.</p>
