			</p><p class="Heading">SPEEDPAY ONLINE PRIVACY STATEMENT</p>
			<p>Effective Date:  9/15/2003</p>
			<p class="Heading">OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</p>
			<p>Speedpay, Inc. ("SPI") is a subsidiary of First Data Corporation.  Protecting consumer privacy is very important to us.  This Online Privacy Statement is available to inform you about our collection and use of personal information so that you can make informed choices about how your own information is collected and used. Currently, this SPI Online Privacy Statement is only applicable to customers and visitors in the United States who visit our website. This Online Privacy Statement reflects the SPI policies covering personal information collected by us on or after the effective date shown above. </p>
			<p>We believe that information used responsibly benefits consumers and the economy, whether it is information we house on behalf of consumers conducting transactions or information we collect on behalf of our business clients.  For example, we use consumer information every day to ensure fast and accurate processing of payments. In addition, SPI strives to better serve our customers by offering goods and services that we believe fit their needs and interests. When identifying an opportunity, SPI may use consumer information it has collected in an effort to identify consumers who may be interested in that opportunity. </p>
			<p>Each day we strive to reinforce our commitment to our clients and consumers.  Central to that commitment is ensuring that we abide by a set of privacy policies, which are outlined below.  These policies guide us in the collection and use of information as well as employee responsibilities in protecting your privacy.  We use personal information about consumers only in a manner consistent with these policies.</p>
			<p class="Heading">COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</p>
			<p>SPI collects personal information in order to offer or provide goods and services to consumers and our customers. We may obtain this information from a variety of sources:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Directly from customer applications, questionnaires and other materials submitted to us by customers;</li>
				<li>From transactions in which SPI and consumers are involved;</li>
				<li>From clickstream activity on our web sites (including the use of "cookies", discussed below); and</li>
				<li>From a variety of third-party sources, such as our business customers, government repositories, consumer reporting agencies and other financial institutions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your hard drive by a web server.  This website may use cookies to tell our servers who you are when you return to our website and to gather other information that we may use or permit others to use from time to time as otherwise provided in this Online Privacy Statement.  You can usually set parameters on your computer that allow you to elect to accept cookies or to have your browser notify you each time a cookie is offered.  You can also usually delete cookies from your hard drive.  Instructions on how to accept cookies, on how to be notified that a cookie is being offered and on how to delete cookies are available through your Internet Browser.</p>
			<p class="Heading">DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</p>
			<p>When SPI collects information on behalf of its business customers, SPI handles the information based on their direction, in accordance with its agreements and contracts with them and applicable laws.</p>
			<p>When SPI obtains personal information as part of its direct relationship with consumers, SPI does not disclose customer information to third parties without first giving customers an opportunity to opt-out of certain kinds of disclosures. There are some disclosures to third parties that are not subject to the opt-out, such as disclosures necessary to effect, administer or enforce a transaction requested by you, to companies that perform services for us or to prevent fraud. In addition, SPI may disclose customer information to companies that, like SPI, are part of the First Data corporate family.  Finally, SPI may disclose information about former customers to third parties and companies with which SPI is affiliated, as well as unaffiliated third parties.  Those disclosures may consist of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Financial background information describing a customer's financial status;</li>
				<li>Identification information, such as name and address data; </li>
				<li>Transaction information, such as account activity, debit activity or credit activity; and</li>
				<li>Other information relating to financial matters.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Heading">RECIPIENTS OF INFORMATION</p>
			<p>SPI may disclose consumer information to companies affiliated with SPI and to companies or other parties not affiliated with SPI (subject to consumers' opt-out rights).  These recipients include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Financial institutions, such as banks, credit card companies and brokerage houses;</li>
				<li>Retailers, such as home furnishers, clothing stores and florists;</li>
				<li>Companies that process transactions or provide other services for us;</li>
				<li>Government agencies; and</li>
				<li>Catalogue companies and other direct marketers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, under federal law SPI is permitted to disclose customer information to certain recipients, such as credit reporting companies.</p>
			<p class="Heading">WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONAL CONSUMER INFORMATION.</p>
			<p>SPI limits access to personal information to those employees of SPI and its affiliates who need it to fulfill their business responsibilities.  Employees must adhere to SPI privacy policies. Employees violating these policies may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. Vendors and other outside contractors we engage are subject to our contractual requirements to ensure that sensitive personal information is safeguarded. </p>
			<p class="Heading">WE USE APPROPRIATE SECURITY SAFEGUARDS.</p>
			<p>At SPI, security is a priority.  We employ appropriate measures to protect consumer information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. These may include, among others, encryption, physical access security and other appropriate technologies. SPI continually reviews and enhances its security systems, as necessary.</p>
			<p class="Heading">WE MAINTAIN PROCEDURES TO ASSURE THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHERE APPLICABLE, WE WILL INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT HOW THEY CAN ACCESS THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND MAKE CORRECTIONS, IF NECESSARY.</p>
			<p>SPI employs appropriate measures to assure the quality of information we collect directly from consumers. Where information is collected by SPI directly from consumers or sources other than our business customers, we permit them, if possible, to dispute or correct any erroneous or out-of-date personally identifiable information.  Of course, this correction would not be possible if the information is proprietary to one of our business customers, reflects historical transaction information or if correction would violate the privacy or legal rights of a third party.  Where applicable, we abide by laws related to such information.  You can access your registration information by calling customer services at the number listed below.  You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a written request that credibly shows error.  Call the customer service number listed below for details.  We reserve the right to independently verify claims made. To protect your privacy and security, we also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before making corrections. We reserve the right to assess a service charge for providing you with any information in connection with your request.</p>
			<p class="Heading">THE SPI® WEBSITE IS NOT DIRECTED AT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13.</p>
			<p>Our website is not directed at children under the age of 13 and SPI does not collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under the age of 13.</p>
			<p class="Heading">SPI'S WEBSITE MAY BE LINKED TO OTHER WEBSITES</p>
			<p>SPI may create links to third party websites. SPI is not responsible for the content or privacy practices employed by websites that are linked from our website. </p>
			<p class="Heading">OPT OUT RIGHT (NON-VERMONT CONSUMERS)</p>
			<p>SPI may disclose consumer information to third parties as described earlier in this notice.  Many of these disclosures are beneficial to consumers because they permit goods and services of interest to consumers to be offered to consumers at attractive rates. We strive to give consumers choices about how their data will be used. You have the right to opt-out of (direct us not to make) these disclosures when the consumer information is about you.  Of course, there are some disclosures to third parties that are not subject to the opt-out, such as disclosures necessary to effect, administer or enforce a transaction requested by you, to companies that perform services for us or to prevent fraud.</p>
			<p>If you wish to opt out, call the customer service number listed below.  You always have the right to change your mind. If you do not opt out, we'll assume that you have agreed that SPI may use your personal information to determine what goods and services you may be interested in, offer you goods and services that we think meet your needs, disclose your personal information to third parties, and for the other purposes described herein. </p>
			<p>SPI maintains the information it collects on each transaction for a fixed time period.  In the event you perform a transaction and exercise your right to opt out, your information and your opt out decision will be maintained for the fixed time period.  In the event you do not perform another transaction during the fixed time period, your personal information, as well as your opt out election, will be removed from our records.  After the removal of your information from our records, you will have to exercise your right to opt out again if you provide us with your information again.</p>
			<p class="Heading">VERMONT CONSUMERS</p>
			<p>SPI will not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties (other than as permitted by law) unless you authorize us to make that disclosure.  Your authorization must be in writing, or, if you agree, in electronic form.  If you wish to authorize us to disclose your nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties, you may either write to us at 12500 East Belford Ave - M22A1, Englewood, CO 80112, or send us an email at privacy@ecommercegroup.com.  Your written or electronic authorization must contain your name, address and signature and state that you authorize us to disclose your nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties.  You may revoke your consent at any time by calling us at (866) 812-7820, or by writing or emailing us at the addresses provided above.</p>
			<p class="Heading">WE HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO OUR PRIVACY PRINCIPLES.</p>
			<p>SPI is committed to meeting the highest standards for our privacy program. To that end, SPI has appointed a senior official, who serves as the company-wide officer with responsibility for the administration and implementation of the SPI privacy program. </p>
			<p>The SPI officer, working closely with the business, is responsible for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Administering employee privacy training and employee compliance related to the SPI Privacy Policies;</li>
				<li>Conducting periodic assessments of SPI's compliance with its Privacy Policies, as well as specific implementation policies and procedures; and</li>
				<li>Ensuring that SPI actively participates in appropriate privacy activities, including self-regulatory initiatives.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>As stated above, this SPI Online Privacy Statement is currently only applicable to our website customers and visitors in the United States.  As we develop websites for international audiences, we may adopt additional rules and practices consistent with this statement to conform to the policies or requirements of those countries.  We may alter this statement as needed for certain products and services and to abide by local laws or regulations around the world.
