					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
						<p><strong>Spelgrim</strong> is committed to protecting your privacy online. To further this commitment, we have adopted an Online Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store, and use the information collected about you online. </p>
						<p><strong>What information does Spelgrim collect?</strong><br>
						Spelgrim may request and/or collect information from you on a voluntary basis when you: register with us, or when you send questions or comments via e-mail to Spelgrim customer support. The requested information may include personal information such as your name and e-mail address.<br>
						If you are under the age of 13, you will need your parent or guardian's consent before you can provide any personal information to us for purposes of registration and other online activities. </p>
						<p><strong>Sign up to our free newsletter</strong><br>
						If you wish to sign up to our free newsletter, you will be asked to supply personal information such as your e-mail address. With your permission, Spelgrim uses such information to periodically contact you with product information news, special offers and new games that are released. </p>
						<p><strong>E-mail</strong><br>
						By allowing you to send e-mail to us, we are not attempting to collect any personal information about you. We will only use personal information (such as name and e-mail address) contained in your e-mail to respond to your specific inquiry or comments in the e-mail. Although we may retain your e-mail for a period of time, we will not use any personal information contained in your e-mail for any purpose other than responding to your specific inquiry or comments.<br>
						Whatever the activity may be, we will only collect information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.</p>
						<p><strong>Opt out</strong><br>
