<p><br>Similarly, you’ll see that when you visit us at <a href="http://www.speedousa.com">www.speedousa.com</a>, we provide you the opportunity to link to other sites not operated by us.

<p><strong>surveys and polls<br></strong>In order to collect details about you without chatting up every person that visits our site individually, we may conduct periodic surveys and polls of our users. We will either post these on our website or get them out to you by email. The questions in these surveys and polls are sometimes asked on behalf of a particular client or sometimes for several clients at once. Any information we collect from the survey will be edited before we release it to a client, and sometimes we will receive compensation for a portion or all of this information. All surveys are optional and any prizes offered for participating in a speedousa.com survey are awarded based on a random drawing.&nbsp; When you participate in a survey, you are completely anonymous, and the replies you give us are instantly separated from your personal information.

If you do give us your name or e-mail address in some section of the form where we have not requested it, we will delete it before releasing the data outside speedousa.com.&nbsp; The survey reports we send out to clients will include aggregated data.&nbsp; If we ask you for a zip code it is just to help us compare the opinions of users from all different parts of our speedousa.com membership. We will only participate in survey initiatives on behalf of clients whom we believe will protect your privacy.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br><strong>chat rooms and other services</strong><br>You must be at least age 13 to use enter any chat rooms and message boards we may decide to include on the site.&nbsp; Although we reserve the right to monitor chat rooms and message boards, the volume can be overwhelming.
