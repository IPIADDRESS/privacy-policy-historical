          the Site, we (either directly or working in concert with our marketing services providers) may
          conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behaviour based on personal
          data and other information that has been provided or received by us. For example, we may
          combine information about visitors to the Site to determine how best to target our marketing
          and the products that we offer in certain areas, regions or countries. This research may be
          compiled and analysed on an aggregate basis and if this aggregated information does not
          identify you personally then is not classified or treated as personal data under this Privacy
          Policy.</p>

          <h6>Do We Share Your Information?</h6>

          <p>We seek to receive your consent before sharing your information when required by
          applicable laws and regulations. However, in some cases your permission will be given as
          part of a contract you have with us.
          </p>

          <p>
          Your personal data is intended for Spell Designs Pty Ltd and for their services providers
          located within or outside the European Union, and, where relevant, to our partners. We won’t
          sell, rent, or disclose your personal data to other entities without your consent or if you
          oppose such use.
          </p>

          <p>Examples of instances in which we share your personal data are provided below:</p>

          <p><strong>Order Fulfilment and Fraud Protection:</strong> If you choose to make a purchase on the Site, we may
          collect from you your credit or debit card number, billing address, shipping address and other
          information related to such a purchase, and we may use such collected information in order to
          fulfil your purchase. We may also provide such information, or other personal data provided
          by you, to unaffiliated third parties as necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to
          process your credit card). In addition, we may share your personal data with fraud protection
          services to assist us in preventing fraud and protecting our customers from credit card fraud.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we
          might sell, assign, buy, transfer or otherwise acquire or dispose of certain businesses or
          corporate assets. In the event of such or similar event, personal data may be part of the
          transferred assets. If all or part of our assets are sold or acquired by another party, or if we
          merger with another entity, then you grant us the right to assign your personal data collected
          via the Site, and you acknowledge and agree that any successor to or acquirer of us and/or
          our eCommerce service provider will continue to have the right to use your personal data and

          </p>

          <p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> As noted above about our eCommerce service

          to assess our partners data protection practices.</p>

          protect or defend our rights, interests or property or that of other customers or users, (iii) to

          reasons not specified herein. We will periodically update this Privacy Policy to inform you of
          any changes to our data use and sharing practices.</p>

          with other marketeers, partners, and other third parties.</p>

          <p>Please be aware that we may store personal data or it may be included in databases owned
          and maintained by our agents or third-party service providers. As the data controller, we take
          all appropriate steps to protect the security and confidentiality of all personal data provided
          via the Site from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration and/or
          destruction.</p>

          <h6>What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Personal data?</h6>

          <p>You have several choices available when it comes to your personal data. We will honour the
          choices you make regarding your personal data. If you have created and maintained a user
          account on the Site, you will be able to sign in and update your account (including contact)
          information. You may also write to us at the address provided herein and update your contact
          information or to change your subscription preferences. In addition, you may:</p><p>

          </p><p><strong>Limit The Personal Data You Provide:</strong> You can use the Site and limit the personal data you
          provide either by disabling cookies or by not registering an account with us. If you choose to
          limit the personal data you provide and/or to disable cookies, you may not be able to use
          certain functionalities of the Site. For instance, in order to purchase goods and services on the
          Site, payment and shipping information must necessarily be provided.</p>

          <p><strong>Manage Your Subscription Preferences:</strong> We may send your information by email or text
          message. If you provide your mobile phone number and ask to receive information by text
          message, we may provide information in that manner. Additionally, we may send automated
          text messages (if you provide consent where required by the applicable regulations). Where
          you consent to receive automated text messages from us, please note that your consent
          includes consent to receive both autodialled and/or pre-recorded telemarketing text messages
          or non-automated messages from or on behalf of Spell Designs Pty Ltd and its affiliated
          companies at the telephone number you provided. You further understand that consent is not
          a condition of purchase and that message and data rates may apply.</p>

          <p><strong>Opt-Out of Marketing Emails and Texts:</strong> For email marketing, you will have an opportunity
          to change your subscription preferences by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained
          in all promotional emails sent by us or on our behalf. Please note that while we honour all
          subscription requests as timely as possible, it may take a short time to become effective.
          Please be aware that even if you opt-out of receiving future promotional communications,
          you may, if you utilize the eCommerce features of the Site, be sent certain transactional
          communications related to the purchase or shipment of items purchased. Thus, if you order
          online, we will send you an email confirming your order and may need to contact you by
          phone, email or regular mail if we have questions about your order. Additionally, an opt-out
          will not remove you from messages that we are required to send under relevant laws or
          regulations. You may ask us not to contact you by text message at any time by responding to
          a text message after it is received. For automated text messages, you will have the
          opportunity to opt-out by replying “STOP” to any message received. Please note that you
          hereby consent to receiving a confirmatory message in response to any opt-out request. We
          will process your unsubscribe request as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some
          circumstances you may receive a few more messages until the unsubscribe request is
          processed.</p>

          <p><strong>Be Forgotten:</strong> In addition to unsubscribing, you also have the right to request us to forget
          your information. If you request us to do so, then except to the extent applicable law requires
          us to retain your information, we will delete it from our systems and databases. To be

          <h6>What Happens When I Link To or From Another Website?</h6>

          <p>The Site may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by us (the "Third-

          <p>Please note that our Site does not support “Do Not Track” browser settings and do not

          Is Information Collected From Minors Under The Age of 13?</p>


          <p>Protecting the privacy of children is extremely important to us. The Site is directed toward a
          general audience and is not directed at nor intended for use by children. We do have our
          Little Gypsies range of children’s clothing, but our expectation and experience is that parents
          or guardians shop for this for their children. We do not knowingly collect or intend to collect
          personal data from anyone who is under the age of 13 unless consent is given or authorized
          by the holder of parental responsibility over the minor. In the absence of such a consent or
          authorization, if you are under the age of 13, you should not provide any personal data to us
          and you should use the Site only with the knowledge, permission and involvement of a parent
          or the holder of parental responsibility. We encourage parents and holder of the parental
          responsibility to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy
          Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal data through the Site. If you
          have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to us,
          please contact us and we will endeavour to delete that information from our databases.</p>

          <h6>Services to Minors under 13</h6>

          <p>Our services are not intended to be used by minors under the age of 13 years old and are
          exclusively provided to persons over the age of 13 and enjoying legal capacity. We will not
          knowingly collect or process personal data from minors under the age of 13. Should we be
          made aware of data collection from minors through our Services, we will take all appropriate
          steps to delete these personal data from our servers.</p>

          <h6>Transfers of Personal Data Outside the European Union?</h6>

          <p>If you are visiting our Site, please be aware that you may send information (including
          personal data) outside the European Union and especially to Australia, Canada, the USA or
          elsewhere where some of our servers may be located. We will hold and process your
          personal data in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations regarding these
          transfers. To this end, we will accomplish any appropriate formalities to authorize this
          transfer. By using our Site, you thereby consent to this Data Transfer.</p>

          <h6>How Will I Be Informed About Changes Regarding This Privacy Policy?</h6>

          <p>The Site and our business may change from time to time. As a result (and for other business
          and/or technological reasons), it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy
          Policy. We reserve the right to update, change, amend or modify this Privacy Policy at any
          time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and
          especially before you provide any personal data.</p>

          <p>If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy (as determined by us), we will post a
          notice on the Site notifying users of the changes and providing an opportunity for you to take
          action relative to those changes prior to their implementation. In some cases, we also may
          send an email notifying registered user of any upcoming changes.</p>

          <p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the
          Site after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy become effective indicates your
          agreement with the terms of such revised and then current Privacy Policy.</p>

          <h6>Your Privacy Rights</h6>

          <p>It is vitally important for you to keep your personal data accurate, current and complete at all
          times, as well as for you to be able to reach us should you have any questions or concerns
          regarding this privacy policy. If we are unable to address your issue immediately, we will
          respond as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>By virtue of the European General Data Protection Regulation n°2016/679 (“GDPR”), any
          user residing within a Member State of the European Union has the right to access, rectify
          and oppose, to the processing of his/her personal data and a right to erasure, in the conditions
          set out in the GDPR. Such EU residents may exercise their rights at any time by writing to
          privacy@spelldesigns.com or to the address at the end of this Privacy Policy (Section
          “Contacting Us” below).</p>

          <p>You have the right to receive your personal data you have provided to us in a structured,
          commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit that personal
          data to another controller, where technically feasible.</p>

          <p>If there is a dispute regarding the processing of your personal data, you may send your claim
          to us by contacting us using the information set out in the section “Who is the data
          controller?” of this Policy. We will try to find a satisfactory solution for you to ensure
          compliance to the applicable regulations and to this Policy. In the absence of a response from
          us, or should the dispute remain in spite of our remediation proposal, you may submit your
          claim to the competent data protection authority. For example, in the UK, this data protection
          authority is the “Information Commissioner’s Office”.</p>

          <h6>How long do we keep your information?</h6>

          <p>We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes described in
          this Privacy Policy and in accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations. We
          undertake to archive and delete your personal data as soon as the purpose of the collection is
          fulfilled, and the data retention period has expired.</p>

          <p>By virtue of the European General Data Protection Regulation n°2016/679, the retention of
          personal data relating to any user residing within a Member State of the European Union is
          summarized in the table below, which describes the maximum periods for which personal
          data of EU residents will be stored by us according to the purpose for which their personal
          data is collected and processed.</p>

          <p>These maximum periods apply unless you have requested your personal data to be deleted or
          ceased being used before these expiration periods, subject to any mandatory legal
          requirement applicable to data retention.</p>

          	registration).</p>

          	<h6>What types of cookies do we use?</h6>

          	<p>When you access our Services, the following types of cookies may be placed on your Device.
          	They can be categorized according to their source, their technical features and their purpose.
          	These categories are not mutually exclusive, and a cookie may thus belong to several of the
          	following categories.</p>

          	<h4>Cookies from internal/external source</h4>

          	<p><em>Cookies from internal source (First-party cookies)</em></p><p>

          	</p><p>First-party cookies are cookies placed on your Device directly by us and can only be read by

          	our Services or our offers to your centres of interests.</p>

          	<h4>Session/persistent cookies</h4>

          	<p><em>Session cookies</em></p><p>

          	</p><p>Session cookies are cookies that are placed on your Device during a browser session and that
          	become invalid once the browser is closed. We and our partners use session cookies for
          	various reasons, including to manage and measure your access and use of our Services during
          	a single browser session and to help you to use our Services more efficiently. For example,
          	session cookies are used to remind our Services that your Device is logged into our Services.</p>

          	<p><em>Persistent cookies</em></p><p>

          	</p><p>Persistent cookies are cookies that are placed on your Device during a browser session and
          	that remain stored in your Device during a defined period of time. For example, persistent
          	cookies allow our Services to recognize your Device when it is used to access our Services
          	with a new browser session and to help you quickly sign-in to our Services again. We and our
          	partners may also use persistent cookies for analytical purposes.</p>

          	<h4>Cookies for technical/advertising/social network/targeting/analytics purposes</h4>

          	<p>The cookies used by our Services may have the following purposes:</p>

          	<p><em>Technical cookies</em></p><p>

          	</p><p>Technical cookies are used to help us identify your Device to recognize you as a returning
          	user and to save preferences you have determined in the course of your previous access to the
          	Services. Technical cookies therefore may allow us to deliver content tailored to your interest
          	and save you the time of having to re-enter information when you use our Services.</p>

          	<p><em>Advertising cookies</em></p><p>

          	</p><p>Advertising cookies are used to help us customize the content and the advertisements you
          	may view when accessing the Services or which are displayed on third parties’ services in
          	order to promote our Services.</p>

          	<p><em>Social networks cookies</em></p><p>

          	</p><p>Social networks cookies are used to verify if you are logged in to such third-parties’ social
          	network services (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, et cetera)/</p>

          	<p><em>Targeting cookies</em></p><p>

          	</p><p>Targeting cookies are used to enable us to target (emailing, database enrichment)
          	retrospectively or in real time the user Device.</p>

          	<p><em>Analytics cookies</em></p><p>

          	</p><p>Analytics cookies are used to monitor statistics of our Services’ traffic (either about the use

          	measure and review the effectiveness of our interactive online content, its characteristics,
          	advertising and other communications.</p>

          	<h6>Your rights</h6>

          	<p>Depending on the type of cookie we place on your Device, we may need your consent for
          	such cookies to be placed on your Device from time to time. We obtain this consent when
          	you use our Services.</p>

          	<h6>Your cookie choices</h6>

          	<p>There are a number of ways to manage cookies. Most internet browsers are initially set up to
          	automatically accept cookies. You can change the settings of your browser to block cookies
          	systematically or based on their origin or to alert you when cookies are being sent to your
          	Device. Typically, you can check the steps for managing cookies in your particular browser's
          	help menu.</p>

          	<h4>Cookie permission</h4>

          	<p>You control whether a cookie is stored on your Device. You can set your preferences and
          	modify them free of charge at any time using your browser settings.
          	If you have set your browser to store cookies on your Device, cookies in the pages and
          	content you have viewed may be stored temporarily in a dedicated location in your Device.
          	They can only be read by the sender.</p>

          	<h4>Cookie refusal</h4>

          	<p>If you refuse permission for cookies to be stored on your Device or if you delete those that
          	are already stored, you will no longer be able to use certain features of our Services. As an
          	example, this will affect content or services that can only be accessed by logging in. Also, we
          	and our service providers will be unable to identify the type of browser your Device is using
          	for technical compatibility purposes, your language and display. We cannot be held liable for
          	the consequences of our Services functioning less efficiently because we are unable to store
          	or read cookies required for it to operate where you have rejected or deleted them.</p>
