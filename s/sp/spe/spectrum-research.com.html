    <td class="TEXTOBJECT">Spectrum Research, Inc. recognizes the importance of 
      protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our web 
      sites and all of our customers. We created this policy with a fundamental 
      respect for our users’ right to privacy and to guide our relationships 
      with our users. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for 
      all products and services owned by Spectrum Research, Inc.<br><br>
      
      <font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE<br></font>
      Spectrum Research collects information from our website users and customers. In 
      this section of our privacy policy, we will describe the type of 
      information we collect and how we use it to provide better services to our 
      customers.<br><br><font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">Registration and 
      Ordering<br></font>When signing up for certain selected services or 
      products, users must first register. During registration, users are 
      required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address, 
      mailing address and phone number). We also may collect demographic 
      information (such as job title and purchasing responsibilities, company 
      information and professional certification). For internal purposes, we use 
      this information to communicate with users and provide requested services, 
      and, for our website visitors, to provide a more personalized experience 
      on our site. We use aggregate demographic information about our audience 
      to improve our service, for marketing purposes and/or industry reporting 
      purposes.<br><br>For our services that require payment (such as products 
      and contract work), we also collect credit card information (such as 
      account name, number and expiration date), which is used for billing 
      purposes only, and is not otherwise shared.<br><br><font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">Communications with Us<br></font>We have features 
      where users can submit information to us (such as our feedback forms). 
      Requests for service, support or information may be forwarded as needed to 
      best respond to a specific request. We may retain e-mails and other 
      information sent to us for our internal administrative purposes, and to 
      help us to serve customers better.<br><br><font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">Communications from Us: Service Updates, Special 
      Offers<br></font>In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates 
      that contain important information about our site and services. For 
      example, we send new customers a welcoming message, and verify password 
      and username for our password-protected programs and services. We may also 
      communicate with a user to provide requested services and for 
      account-related issues via e-mail, phone or regular mail.<br><br>We offer 
      our users the option to receive information about our company, related 
      products, services and special deals. Users can choose not to receive 
      these communications, as set forth in our Permission section 
      below.<br><br><font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">Automatic Data 
      Collection<br></font>Our web sites have features that automatically 
      collect information from users, to deliver content specific to users' 
      interests and to honor their preferences. This information assists us in 
      creating sites that will serve the needs of our users.<br><br>We use 
      "cookies," a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing 
      information about the user. Cookies benefit the user by requiring login 
      only once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the 
      cookies, they may be limited in the use of some areas of our site. 
      Additionally, we may note some of the pages the user visits on our site 
      through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). The use of cookies 
      and pixels enable us to track and target the interests of our users to 
      enhance the experience on our sites.<br><br>Some of our business 
      affiliates use cookies on our sites in ads or promotions. However, we have 
      no access to or control over these business affiliates' cookies; we urge 
      users to read their privacy policies for information.<br><br>For our 
      internal purposes, we gather date, time, browser type, navigation history 
      and IP address of all visitors to our site. This information does not 
      contain anything that can identify users personally. We use this 
      information for our internal security audit log, trend analysis and system 
      administration, and to gather broad demographic information about our user 
      base for aggregate use.<br><br>We may combine demographic information 
      supplied by a customer at registration with site usage data to provide 
      general profiles, in aggregate non-personally identifiable form, about our 
      users and their preferences in the content of the site and advertising. We 
      may share this composite information with our advertisers and business 
      affiliates to help them better understand our services.<br><br>
      
      <font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">WITH WHOM YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED<br></font>
      You personal information will not be shared with any 3rd party.
      
      
      <br><br>
      <font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION<br></font>If 
      a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), 
      or if a user no longer desires our product(s)/service(s), we provide a way 
      to correct or update that user's personal data. The user should contact 
      Customer Support for the applicable product or service.<br><br><font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">PERMISSION<br></font>Our users are given the 
      opportunity to choose whether to receive information from our affiliates 
      and us not directly related to the registered services. Users also have 
      the opportunity to choose whether to have personal information shared with 
      third parties for marketing purposes. Instructions for how to exercise 
      this choice are contained in e-mails sent by us and on our web site. 
      Please note that we will endeavor to implement requests within a 
      reasonable time, although for a time users may continue to receive 
      mailings, etc., based on information released prior to the implementation 
      of the request. Users will continue to receive information directly 
      related to their registered services, so they always are kept 
      informed.<br><br><font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">SECURITY<br></font>We use 
      reasonable precautions to protect our users' personal information and to 
      store it securely. Sensitive information that is transmitted to us online 
      (such as credit card number) is encrypted and is transmitted to us 
      securely. In addition, access to all of our users' information, not just 
      the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees 
      who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing 
      clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to 
      personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers on which we 
      store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure 
      environment.<br><br><font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">LINKS<br></font>Our web 
      site may contain links to other sites. Spectrum Research is not 
      responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites. We 
      encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the 
      privacy statements of each web site to which we may link that may collect 
      personally identifiable information.<br><br><font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">NOTIFICATION and CHANGES<br></font>If we change our 
      privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so our users are 
      aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under which 
      circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Users should check this policy 
      frequently to keep abreast of any changes.<br><br>For questions about this 
      privacy statement, the practices of this site or any dealings with 
      Spectrum Research, contact us at:<br><br>
