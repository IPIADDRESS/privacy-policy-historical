Spectrum Research recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all information 
provided by users of our web sites and all of our customers. We created this policy with a fundamental 
respect for our users’ right to privacy and to guide our relationships with our users. This privacy 
statement discloses the privacy practices for all products and services owned by Spectrum Research.<br><br> 
<font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE<br></font>
Spectrum Research collects information from our website users and customers. In this section of our privacy 
policy, we will describe the type of information we collect and how we use it to provide better services 
to our customers.<br><br> 
<font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">Registration and Ordering<br></font>
When signing up for certain selected services or products, users must first register. During 
registration, users are required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address, 
mailing address and phone number). We also may collect demographic information (such as job title and 
purchasing responsibilities, company information and professional certification). For internal purposes, 
we use this information to communicate with users and provide requested services, and, for our website 
visitors, to provide a more personalized experience on our site. We use aggregate demographic 
information about our audience to improve our service, for marketing purposes and/or industry reporting 
purposes.<br><br>
For our services that require payment (such as products and contract work), we also collect credit card 
information (such as account name, number and expiration date), which is used for billing purposes only, 
and is not otherwise shared.<br><br> 
<font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">Communications with Us<br></font>
We have features where users can submit information to us (such as our feedback forms). Requests for 
service, support or information may be forwarded as needed to best respond to a specific request. We 
may retain e-mails and other information sent to us for our internal administrative purposes, and to 
help us to serve customers better.<br><br> 
<font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">Communications from Us: Service Updates, Special Offers<br></font>
In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates that contain important information about our 
site and services. For example, we send new customers a welcoming message, and verify password and 
username for our password-protected programs and services. We may also communicate with a user to 
provide requested services and for account-related issues via e-mail, phone or regular mail.<br><br> 
We offer our users the option to receive information about our company, related products, services and 
special deals. Users can choose not to receive these communications, as set forth in our Permission 
section below.<br><br> 
<font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">Automatic Data Collection<br></font>
Our web sites have features that automatically collect information from users, to deliver content 
specific to users' interests and to honor their preferences. This information assists us in creating 
sites that will serve the needs of our users.<br><br> 
We use "cookies," a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. 
Cookies benefit the user by requiring login only once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users 
reject the cookies, they may be limited in the use of some areas of our site. Additionally, we may note 
some of the pages the user visits on our site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). 
The use of cookies and pixels enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the 
experience on our sites.<br><br> 
Some of our business affiliates use cookies on our sites in ads or promotions. However, we have no 
access to or control over these business affiliates' cookies; we urge users to read their privacy 
policies for information.<br><br> 
For our internal purposes, we gather date, time, browser type, navigation history and IP address of 
all visitors to our site. This information does not contain anything that can identify users personally. 
We use this information for our internal security audit log, trend analysis and system administration, 
and to gather broad demographic information about our user base for aggregate use.<br><br> 
We may combine demographic information supplied by a customer at registration with site usage data to 
provide general profiles, in aggregate non-personally identifiable form, about our users and their 
preferences in the content of the site and advertising. We may share this composite information with 
our advertisers and business affiliates to help them better understand our services.<br><br> 
<font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">WITH WHOM YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED<br></font>
When we have co-branded, customized, private label, powered by or sponsored products and services, or 
when we join with other parties to provide specific services, we may share (provide and receive) 
personal information with them. We do not share credit card information with such third parties.<br><br> 
On occasion, we may provide targeted lists of names and offline and online contact information for 
marketing purposes to third parties, subject to our Permission policies. We give users the option of 
not having their name or contact information disclosed to third parties, as set forth in the Permission 
section.<br><br> 
Other than as set forth above, we do not share personally identifiable information with other companies, 
apart from those acting as our agents in providing our product(s)/service(s), and which agree to use it 
only for that purpose and to keep the information secure and confidential. We will disclose information 
we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or 
other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we 
have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal 
action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or 
unintentionally) our rights or property. Users should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. 
Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information 
to be shared or transferred to third parties without permission.<br><br> 
We may share aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, with others. This information 
may include usage and demographic data, but it will not include personal information.<br><br> 
<font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION<br></font>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), or if a user no longer 
desires our product(s)/service(s), we provide a way to correct or update that user's personal data. The 
user should contact Customer Support for the applicable product or service.<br><br> 
<font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">PERMISSION<br></font>
Our users are given the opportunity to choose whether to receive information from our affiliates and us 
not directly related to the registered services. Users also have the opportunity to choose whether to 
have personal information shared with third parties for marketing purposes. Instructions for how to 
exercise this choice are contained in e-mails sent by us and on our web site. Please note that we will 
endeavor to implement requests within a reasonable time, although for a time users may continue to 
receive mailings, etc., based on information released prior to the implementation of the request. Users 
will continue to receive information directly related to their registered services, so they always are 
kept informed.<br><br> 
<font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">SECURITY<br></font>
We use reasonable precautions to protect our users' personal information and to store it securely. 
Sensitive information that is transmitted to us online (such as credit card number) is encrypted and is 
transmitted to us securely. In addition, access to all of our users' information, not just the sensitive 
information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific 
job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally 
identifiable information. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are 
kept in a secure environment.<br><br> 
<font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">LINKS<br></font>
Our web site may contain links to other sites. Spectrum Research is not responsible for the privacy practices 
or content of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read 
the privacy statements of each web site to which we may link that may collect personally identifiable 
information.<br><br> 
<font class="TEXTOBJECTBOLD">NOTIFICATION and CHANGES<br></font>
If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so our users are aware of what 
information we collect, how we use it and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Users 
should check this policy frequently to keep abreast of any changes.<br><br> 
For questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site or any dealings with Spectrum 
Research, contact us at:<br><br>
