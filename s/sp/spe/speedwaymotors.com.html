<h1>Privacy</h1>
<br>
<em><b><a name="collection">What personally identifiable information is being collected?</a></b></em><br>
You may be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information when you visit the Speedway Motors website in order for us to provide you with the products or services that you have requested. For example, when you order a product we may ask you to become a registered user of our site.

Additionaly, our Web servers track various technical details about your visit, such as your computer's IP address and which pages you visited.  That information does not typically contain any personally identifiable information about you.<br>
<br>
<em><b><a name="use">How is the information being used?</a></b></em><br>

<em><b><a name="cookies">What are cookies and how do we use them?</a></b></em><br>
A cookie is a block of text placed in a file on your hard drive by a website you've visited.

<br>
Speedway Motors also uses a session cookie, which is a piece of identification between your browser and our server that helps to do things such as keeping track of the items in your shopping cart. The shopping cart cookie is saved for a designated period of time in case your session expires or if you return to complete a purchase within that time frame.<br>
<em><br>
<b><a name="choices">What choices are available to you regarding the collection, use and distribution of the information and how you can correct any inaccuracies in information?</a></b>
</em>
<br>If you do not want to receive email from us in the future, please let us know by calling, sending an email, or by writing to us at the above postal address and telling us that you do not want to receive email from our company.<br>
<br>
If you provide us with your email address, you may receive messages about your order status, issues regarding the operations of this website, and messages from subsidiaries of Speedway Motors and other companies with operational relationships to Speedway Motors.

<h1>Security</h1>
<br>
<em><b><a name="security">What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control?</a></b></em><br>
Speedway Motors values your business and is committed to doing everything possible to make our online ordering process secure. As always, our 100% satisfaction guarantee applies to any and all purchases from Speedway Motors.<br>
<br>
<b>Secure Ordering Process</b><br>

Any credit card information you enter on our site is strongly encrypted by industry-standard protocol, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). The Speedway Motors website uses SSL to communicate with secure browsers like Firefox, Netscape, and Internet Explorer. These browsers encrypt your credit card and personal information in a way that makes it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept and misuse while being transmitted between your computer and our server. Don't worry if your browser is secure or not - if it is not secure, you will not be able to purchase on our online store.<br>
<br>
Once you have completed your order online, our security procedures do not end. We take appropriate precautions to protect the security and privacy of the information stored on our computer networks. Many of the systems which store your personal information are not connected to the Internet, reducing the likelihood of security breaches. Our systems are also housed in secure facilities, and access to your data by our employees is limited to a "need to know" basis, controlled by password protected systems, and monitored for abuse.<br>
<br>
If you are still unsure of giving your credit card over the Internet, please feel free to phone, fax, or mail your order to us. For telephone ordering or assistance, please call 800.979.0122. Our fax number for orders is 800.768.3733. Or send your order to:<br>
<br>
Speedway Motors, Inc.<br>
Attn: Order Processing<br>
340 Victory Lane<br>
Lincoln, NE  68528<br>
<br>
If you have any further question regarding your online security, please contact us at 800.979.0122 or <a href="http://www.speedwaymotors.com/smi_customerservice.aspx"><u>email Customer Service</u></a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Children</b><br>
<br>
In accordance with federal law, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under age 13 without the verifiable permission of a parent or guardian. If you are under age 13, you are welcome to browse our website. However you are not permitted to use any of the features of our site that require the collection of any personally identifiable information. If we determine that we have erroneously collected a child's information, we will immediately undertake to delete that data from our records.
