			<p>This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes the personal
			  information collected about users of the online dating service accessible
			  via the Website located at www.speeddate.com and related URLs (the "Service")
			  and how such information may be used or disclosed by SpeedDate.com, Inc. (“SpeedDate”).</p>

			<p>The term “You” (and its variants) refers to You as a user of
		    the Service and the term “Us” (and its variants) refers to SpeedDate.&nbsp; </p>
			<h4>Overview</h4>
			<p>As part of the operation of the Service We collect and may disclose information
		  about You. By accepting the SpeedDate.com Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy,
		  You consent to Our use and disclosure of Your personal information as described
		  in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject
		  to the terms of the SpeedDate.com Terms of Use.</p>
			<h4>A Special Note About Children</h4>

			  <p>Please note that individuals under the age of 18 may not submit any personal
		      information to Us or otherwise use the Service. </p>
			<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
			  We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages
			  of the Service. "Cookies" are small files placed on Your hard drive
			  that assist Us in providing customized services. Certain features of the Service
			  are only available with the use of a "cookie." We use this information
			  to determine Our members' demographics, interests, and behavior to better
			  understand and serve You and other members. This information may include the
			  URL of the website that You visited prior to the Service (whether this URL
			  is on the Service or not), the URL of the website You next go to (whether
			  this URL is on the Service or not), what browser You are using and Your Internet
			  Protocol address. Most cookies are "session cookies" meaning that
			  they are automatically deleted from Your hard drive at the end of a session.
			  You are always free not to accept cookies if Your browser permits.<p></p>

			<p>We may use a third party advertising company to serve ads on Our behalf across
			  the Internet. That advertising company may also collect anonymous information
			  about Your visits to the Service. This is primarily accomplished through the
			  use of a technology device, commonly referred to as a Web beacon, cookie or
			  an action tag, which is placed on various Web pages within the Service or
			  in an HTML e-mail that allows the third party advertising company to collect
			  anonymous information. There may also be a number of services offered by external
			  service providers that help You use the Service. If You choose to use these
			  optional services and in doing so disclose information to the external service
			  providers or grant them permission to collect information about You, then
			  their use of Your information will be governed by their private policies,
			  if any.</p>
			<h4>How We Use Personal Information</h4>
			  <p>We use information in the data files We maintain about You, and the other
			    information We obtain from Your current and past activities on the Service
			    to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce Our Terms of Use.
			    We may review the data of multiple members to identify problems or resolve
		      disputes.</p>
			<p>We may use personally identifiable information, data files and other information
              about You including but not limited to images, video recordings, and audio recordings
              to improve Our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze usage of the Service,
              improve Our content and product offerings, and customize the Service content, layout,
              and features. </p>
			<p>We may use Your information to contact You and to deliver information to
			  You that may be targeted to Your interests, such as banner advertisements,
			  administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to
			  Your use of the Service. You agree to receive this information. If You do
			  not wish to receive this information, You may opt out of the receipt of certain
			  communications. To learn how to do so please go to the “Help” section
			  of the Service. </p>

			<h4>Email Policies</h4>
            <p>
            By default, we will send you weekly updates of various site information, a variety of transactional emails such as when users send you a message and the occasional site announcement.
            </p>
            <p>
            You have full control regarding which of these emails you want to receive. To change your options, simply click "Email Alerts" in the Profile tab from any page.
            </p>

            <h4>Inviting Friends</h4>
            <p>
            Inviting friends to SpeedDate.com is always completely optional. When you choose to invite friends, we will send an email to the addresses you enter indicating that it is a message from you. We will share your name and email address with anyone you invite so that they know who the invitation is coming from. If a friend does not respond to the initial invitation after a little while, we will send up to one reminder messages on your behalf.  Your friends may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@speeddate.com">info@speeddate.com</a> to request that we remove their information from our database.
            </p>
            <p>
            For your convenience, SpeedDate.com offers the ability to import email
            addresses from common address books such as Hotmail/Yahoo/Gmail/AOL.
            If you choose to use this feature, we will access your address book
            using the login details that you provide. We access your address book
            only once to retrieve your friends' information so that you may select
            whom to invite. We do not store your login details nor do we use them
            for any other purpose than to retrieve your contacts. We never send
            invitations to contacts you do not leave preselected or explicitly select,
            and your invitations are the only email we will ever send to your friends
            unless they register to join the site.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you have accidentally sent invitations you did not intend - please <a href="mailto:info@speeddate.com">contact us</a> and we can cancel the reminder message.
            </p>
