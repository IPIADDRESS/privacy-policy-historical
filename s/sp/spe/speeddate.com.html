		<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
	</div>
	 
	<div class="inner-content small-font">

			<p>This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes the personal
			  information collected about users of the online dating service accessible
			  via the Website located at www.speeddate.com and related URLs (the "Service")
			  and how such information may be used or disclosed by SpeedDate.com, Inc. (“SpeedDate”).</p>

			<p>The term “You” (and its variants) refers to You as a user of
		    the Service and the term “Us” (and its variants) refers to SpeedDate.&nbsp; </p>
			<h4>Overview</h4>
			<p>As part of the operation of the Service We collect and may disclose information
		  about You. By accepting the SpeedDate.com Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy,
		  You consent to Our use and disclosure of Your personal information as described
		  in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject
		  to the terms of the SpeedDate.com Terms of Use.</p>
			<h4>A Special Note About Children</h4>

			  <p>Please note that individuals under the age of 18 may not submit any personal
		      information to Us or otherwise use the Service. </p>
			<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
			  We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages
			  of the Service. "Cookies" are small files placed on Your hard drive
			  that assist Us in providing customized services. Certain features of the Service
			  are only available with the use of a "cookie." We use this information
			  to determine Our members' demographics, interests, and behavior to better
			  understand and serve You and other members. This information may include the
			  URL of the website that You visited prior to the Service (whether this URL
			  is on the Service or not), the URL of the website You next go to (whether
			  this URL is on the Service or not), what browser You are using and Your Internet
			  Protocol address. Most cookies are "session cookies" meaning that
			  they are automatically deleted from Your hard drive at the end of a session.
			  You are always free not to accept cookies if Your browser permits.<p></p>

			<p>We may use a third party advertising company to serve ads on Our behalf across
			  the Internet. That advertising company may also collect anonymous information
			  about Your visits to the Service. This is primarily accomplished through the
			  use of a technology device, commonly referred to as a Web beacon, cookie or
			  an action tag, which is placed on various Web pages within the Service or
			  in an HTML e-mail that allows the third party advertising company to collect
			  anonymous information. There may also be a number of services offered by external
			  service providers that help You use the Service. If You choose to use these
			  optional services and in doing so disclose information to the external service
			  providers or grant them permission to collect information about You, then
			  their use of Your information will be governed by their private policies,
			  if any.</p>
			<h4>How We Use Personal Information</h4>
			  <p>We use information in the data files We maintain about You, and the other
			    information We obtain from Your current and past activities on the Service
			    to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce Our Terms of Use.
			    We may review the data of multiple members to identify problems or resolve
		      disputes.</p>
			<p>We may use personally identifiable information, data files and other information
              about You including but not limited to images, video recordings, and audio recordings
              to improve Our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze usage of the Service, 
              improve Our content and product offerings, and customize the Service content, layout, 
              and features. </p>
			<p>We may use Your information to contact You and to deliver information to
			  You that may be targeted to Your interests, such as banner advertisements,
			  administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to
			  Your use of the Service. You agree to receive this information. If You do
			  not wish to receive this information, You may opt out of the receipt of certain
			  communications. To learn how to do so please go to the “Help” section
			  of the Service. </p>

			<h4>Email Policies</h4>
            <p>
            By default, we will send you weekly updates of various site information, a variety of transactional emails such as when users send you a message and the occasional site announcement.
            </p>
            <p>
            You have full control regarding which of these emails you want to receive. To change your options, simply click "Email Alerts" in the Profile tab from any page.
            </p>

            <h4>Inviting Friends</h4>
            <p>
            Inviting friends to SpeedDate.com is always completely optional. When you choose to invite friends, we will send an email to the addresses you enter indicating that it is a message from you. We will share your name and email address with anyone you invite so that they know who the invitation is coming from. If a friend does not respond to the initial invitation after a little while, we will send up to one reminder messages on your behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
            For your convenience, SpeedDate.com offers the ability to import email 
            addresses from common address books such as Hotmail/Yahoo/Gmail/AOL. 
            If you choose to use this feature, we will access your address book 
            using the login details that you provide. We access your address book 
            only once to retrieve your friends' information so that you may select 
            whom to invite. We do not store your login details nor do we use them 
            for any other purpose than to retrieve your contacts. We never send 
            invitations to contacts you do not leave preselected or explicitly select,
            and your invitations are the only email we will ever send to your friends 
            unless they register to join the site.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you have accidentally sent invitations you did not intend - please <a href="mailto:info@speeddate.com">contact us</a> and we can cancel the reminder message.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Our Disclosure of Your Information</h4>
			  <p>Although we use industry-standard efforts to protect the personal information
			    We collect via the Service, we cannot guarantee that this information will
			    not be accessed by the government or third parties in certain circumstances.
			    We may be required by law to disclose information to the government, law
			    enforcement agencies or third parties. &nbsp;In addition, third parties
			    may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications
			    and members may abuse or misuse Your information that they collect from
			    the Service. Accordingly, You should not expect that Your personally identifiable
		      information or private communications will remain private in all circumstances. </p>

			  (provided that we may sell such information to a third party in connection
			  with an acquisition of all or part of our business). However, the following
			  describes some of the ways that Your personally identifiable information may
			  be used or disclosed.</p>

			  such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and
			  other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. We do not disclose
			  to these entities any information that could be used to identify You personally.
			  We do not disclose certain information, such as Your name, email address,
			  password, credit card number and bank account number, to marketing advertisers.
			  We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on Our behalf. These
			  companies may employ cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. </p>
			<p>We may require that you submit certain financial information, including Your
			  credit card billing information. We will use this information to bill You
			  for use of Our Services and products. By making a purchase, or engaging in
			  any other kind of activity or transaction that uses financial information
			  on the Service, You consent to Our providing Your financial information to
			  Our service providers and to such third parties as We determine necessary
			  to support and process Your transactions. These third parties may include
			  the credit card companies and banking institutions used to process and support
			  Your transactions. By purchasing, or registering for, or making reservations
			  for products or services of third parties offered on the Service, or by participating
			  in programs offered on the Service that are administered by third parties
			  and that require You to submit financial information in order to use them,
			  You consent to Our providing Your financial information to those third parties.

			  accordance with Our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in
			  accordance with their own privacy policies, over which We have no control,
			  and You agree that We are not responsible or liable for any of their actions
			  or omissions. </p>
			<p>We may share data collected via the Service, including personally identifiable
			  information about You, with Our parent, affiliates, or subsidiaries. Our parent,
			  affiliates and subsidiaries will follow privacy practices no less protective
			  of such personal information than Our practices described in this Privacy
			  Policy. It is possible that We could merge with or be acquired by another
			  business entity. Should such merger or acquisition occur, We would share some
			  or all of Your personal information with the merger partner or acquiring party.
			  The acquiring entity or newly combined entity will follow the practices disclosed
			  in this Privacy Policy with respect to such information. </p>

			<p>We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries and with third parties to enforce
			  laws. You authorize Us to disclose any information about You to law enforcement
			  and other government officials as We in Our sole discretion believe necessary
			  or appropriate in connection with any investigation of fraud or other activity
			  that is illegal or may expose Us or You to liability. </p>

			    a member You have access to members' identification numbers or user names
			    and You might gain access to other contact information of other members

			    any manner that is not authorized by Us and the applicable member. In all
			    cases, You must give members an opportunity to remove their information
			    from Your information databases, including email lists. &nbsp;Under no circumstances
			    may You disclose personally identifiable information about another member
			    to any third party without Our consent and the consent of such other member.
			    You may not add a member to an mail list (email or physical mail) without
		      that member’s express consent. </p>

			    during registration. For instructions on how to do so visit the “Help” section
		      of the Service. </p>

			  law. To learn how to hide or remove Your profile so that others cannot view
			  it visit the “Help” section of the Service. We may retain in Our

			  identifiable information will be completely removed from Our databases in
			  response to Your request.</p>

			  <p>You are responsible for all actions taken with Your login information and
			    password, including any fees or charges incurred based on such use. If You

			    for all actions taken with Your login information and password by such third
			    party. If You believe your password has been disclosed to third parties
		      or otherwise compromised in any way You should immediately change Your password.</p>

			  <p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information
			    We collect from You. If You disclose Your &nbsp;personal information to
			    other parties, whether via the Service or on other sites throughout the
			    Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information
			    You disclose to them. We do not control the privacy policies of any third
			    parties so You should investigate their policies before You disclose Your
		      personal information to them.</p>

			    the law, Your comments, or Our need to accurately reflect Our data collection
			    and disclosure practices. We will notify you of such revisions and
