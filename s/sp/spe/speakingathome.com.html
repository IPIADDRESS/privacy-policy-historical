is detailed in the <a class="text-red" href="terms_and_conditions.html">Conditions of Use</a> and with

15/1999, of the the 13th of December, of Protection of Data of a
Personal Nature at all times. It also adopts necessary measures
to, in relation to such data, prevent unauthorised alteration,

the data to be protected and other existing obligations of
confidentiality. It also agrees not to use the personal data of
the users registered on the websites for different purposes other
than, or related to, the contracting of the services it provides.</p>

required in the registration form to register as a client of the
service and/or the payment corresponding to the contract for the
provision of services. The registration of such data is mandatory;
lack of complementarity of the same by the user or the provision
of incorrect data shall entitle SAH to deny the provision of the
service at any time. The User or Professional can skip or fail to
communicate any data or personal circumstance that is not
absolutely necessary to register as a customer or for the
formation of the contract.</p>
<h3 class="text-red">
<a id="02"></a>2. Information Collection
</h3>
<p>

operations of SAH - described in the <a class="text-red" href="terms_and_conditions.html">Conditions of Use</a>-, and of
its activity, to be incorporated into an automated file owned by
Speakingathome Ltd.
</p>
<p>Additionally, the User consents to the processing of the
User's data in order to inform the User, by any means, including
email, any changes or developments in policies, activity or
products and services of Speakingathome Ltd. or third
collaborating companies.</p>

<p>SAH, within its services, offers the user the possibility to
record classes of that User, although always subject to technical
availability of both the TEACHER and the User.</p>
<p>
The request for the recording by the student in the form contained
in the <a class="text-red" href="terms_and_conditions.html">
Conditions of use</a> involves the express authorization for the
storage, treatment and transmission of the data collected by this
concept in the conditions contained in the present Conditions and
Privacy and Data Protection Policy.
</p>

recording previously mentioned, the user accepts, that if the User
requests a recording of this kind, this will be recorded and
stored on the device of the Teacher, in order to send a copy of
the recording to the User after the completion.</p>

promptly and upon notice, stored on servers of SAH and be used for
checking the quality of the service offered by SAH, as well as in
resolution or investigation of any type of conflict, lawsuit,
complaint, claim, or controversy arising SAH's relationships with
the User, as well as SAH with its teachers, and between teachers
and user.</p>
<p>The user expressly acknowledges that the owner of the file
in which the recording is stored is the TEACHER from whom the user
expressly requested it and that SAH is not the owner or
responsible entity; nor does it have access to the stored data.
Therefore, the exercise of the rights that the data protection law
recognises, as well as any other type of communication or claim
relating to the aforementioned shall be directed directly to the
corresponding teacher.</p>

been no complaint or any claim on a class, the teacher will erase
recordings. After which, recovery is not possible.</p>

safety for the protection of personal data pursuant to the
legislation in force, and has established all the technical means
at its disposal to prevent the loss, misuse, alteration,
unauthorised access and theft of the data provided by Users. All
