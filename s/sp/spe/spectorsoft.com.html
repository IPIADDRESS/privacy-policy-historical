<p>We may disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information that doesn’t identify you, to our partners or other third parties about how our customers, collectively, use our Website but we do not sell or share any information at the individual level.</p>
<h2 class="delta">Your choices and opt-out</h2>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the information you provide to us. You may elect to opt out of receiving direct marketing or market research information. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong>—You can refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. Please be aware that restricting the use of cookies may impact on the functionality of our Website and you may be unable to access certain parts of our Website. More information can be found in our Cookie Policy.</p>
<p>Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising using the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Ads Settings</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Unsubscribing</strong>—In each and every marketing or promotional email that we send to you, there is an ‘unsubscribe’ hyperlink, which you may you use if you wish to ‘opt out’ of and stop receiving email communications from us. The hyperlink will direct you to our website, where upon entering the email address that you no longer wish to receive SpectorSoft emails, one last confirmation email shall then be sent to the email address you designate. Merely confirm that you do indeed wish to stop SpectorSoft email’s being sent to you and that email address shall automatically be unsubscribed.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may visit the <a href="/support/unsubscribe.asp">Unsubscribe request form</a> or email SpectorSoft at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@spectorsoft.com?subject=Unsubscribe">unsubscribe@spectorsoft.com</a> with your request, stating ’Unsubscribe‘ in the header and what email addresses you wish not to receive SpectorSoft emails and within a reasonable period, we shall ensure that such email addresses are unsubscribed and shall no longer receive any communications from us.</p>

<p>You should review this Privacy Policy carefully, because if you do not agree with our practices, your ultimate choice is not to use the Website. Remember, by using any part of the Website, you accept and agree to our privacy practices. If we update this Privacy Policy, your continued use of the Website (following the posting of the revised Privacy Policy) means that you accept and agree to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2 class="delta">User Contributions</h2>
<p>You are responsible for any content, including personal information, that you contribute to be posted, published or displayed on the Website, or transmit to other users of the Website (collectively, User Contributions). Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to other users of the Website at your own risk. Although we limit access to certain pages, you may set certain privacy settings for such information by logging into your account profile, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Website with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions; therefore, we cannot guarantee who will view or use your User Contributions.  We are not responsible for circumvention by third parties of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.   You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or may have been copied or stored by other Website users. Proper access and use of information provided on the Website, including User Contributions, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Website Terms of Use and known or suspected violations should be reported to <a href="mailto:privacy@spectorsoft.com">privacy@spectorsoft.com</a>.</p>
<h2 class="delta">Accessing and correcting your personal information</h2>
<p>You can review, update, correct or delete your personal information by logging into the Website and visiting your account profile page and making changes. If you have forgotten your password, once you have tried to register and failed, you can click on the "Forgot your password?" link to reach a page on which you can submit your e-mail address. Your user name and password then will be e-mailed to you. Alternatively, you can also contact us at privacy@spectorsoft.com if you wish to exercise these rights. While we will strive to accommodate your requests, we may reject requests, which risk the privacy of others, are unreasonable or repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (such as developing new systems or fundamentally changing an existing business practice), or would be extremely impractical. Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort.</p>
<p>If you request that we delete your account we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.</p>
<h2 class="delta">Where we store your personal data</h2>
<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers.  Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password, which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>

<h2 class="delta">Children under the age of 13</h2>
<p>Our Website is not intended for children under 13 years of age.  No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on the Website.  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.  If you are under 13, please do not register on the Website, make any purchases through the Website or send any information about yourself to us. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@spectorsoft.com">legal@spectorsoft.com</a>.</p>
<h2 class="delta">Data security</h2>
<p>We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical and physical security measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers behind firewalls and strictly controlled. Any payment transactions are encrypted using SSL technology.</p>
<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards.  The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.   Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website and any transmission is at your own risk.</p>
<h2 class="delta">Your California privacy rights</h2>
<p>California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@spectorsoft.com">privacy@spectorsoft.com</a>.</p>
<h2 class="delta">Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>It is our policy to post any changes we make to our Privacy Policy on this page. It is your responsibility to check this page from time to time to check for any change. Your continued use of the Website shall be deemed to be your consent to such changes.
	The date the Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page.</p>
