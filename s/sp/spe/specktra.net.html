<br>
<b>2) Take a look at the Announcement Forum for latest updates.</b> Forum Sticky, Announcements, or Global Announcements all contain important pertinent information that we wish for you to read.<br>
<br>
<b>3) Please post clear and concise topic titles. </b>You won’t get the answers/attention you need if your topic title does not illustrate the information you are seeking, or sharing.<br>
<br>
<b>4) Do not use ALL CAPS TO TYPE YOUR TOPIC TITLES AND MESSAGE IN. </b>It’s not good forum etiquette and comes across as SCREAMING. If your post is in all caps and it disappears… don’t be upset!<br>
<br>
<b>5) If you've posted a question but later found the answer yourself, let us know and we will close the thread.</b> This works the same if you just would like to delete your thread.<br>
<br>
<b>6) We have a “Welcome Forum” for new members to post their introductory thread in.</b> We love meeting our new members!! <img src="images/smilies/smile.png" border="0" alt="" title="Smile" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
<b>7) Are you interested in being a Moderator/Staff Member?  </b>Please contact one of our Administrators for an application.<br>
<br>
<b>8 ) No offensive material</b> including: Porn, Racism, Criticism, Violence, etc.... Staff will not tolerate this.<br>
<br>
<b>9) NO SPAM.</b> Please do not spam the forums, also known as ‘Postwhoring’. This includes postwhoring or spamming to reach the 50 posts needed to access the Clearance Bin forums.<br>
<br>
<b>10) Respect others views and opinions.</b> Harassment or personal attacks will NOT be tolerated.<br>
<br>
<b>11) Help others if you can. It's important and it helps the forum grow.</b><br>
<br>
<b>12) Read and follow the guidelines. </b>Disobeying of rules will result in a warning, after 3 warnings you will be permanently banned. If you have been permanently banned DO NOT contact the administrators requesting to be unbanned, we will not even entertain the thought.<br>
<br>
<b>13) Respect moderators.</b> They are tasked to keep the boards in good order and to see to it that activity in the forum remains clean and healthy. They deserve your courtesy and cooperation. No complaints or comments in question of moderation in public, we take these very seriously so please send them directly to a staff member. If you think you’ve been treated unfairly, please contact the moderator via private message.<br>
<br>
<b>14) Do not spam personal site URLs inside any post or private message.</b> Registered and active members are permitted to have a link to a PERSONAL site in the signature area, but not in any part of posts or private messages. Links to sites with forum content and theme similar to Specktra.Net are not permitted, nor are they allowed to be promoted via the Private Messaging system. Abuse of this will result in your membership to the forum being terminated. If you own a beauty related site with a forum feature, please email janice@specktra.net for a link exchange.<br>
<br>
<b>15) If you have experienced, or in the middle of a problem swap, please do not vengefully post their personal information on the forums.</b> If you can not contain yourself we will be forced to suspend your account until you cool down. SwapTawk is THE BEST resource for problem swaps.<br>
<br>
<b>16) eBay links in the counterfeit forum are restricted to determining authenticity only.</b> Please do not post affiliate links on the forum. Accounts found to be abusing this guideline will be warned and placed on moderation.<br>
<br>
<b>17) Please use the search function and do your own research before asking questions.</b> We strongly discourage members to be dependent on the forums for minor questions (and worse ones that have been asked and answered hundreds of times before). We simply can't, nor do we want to waste bandwidth on, spoonfeed each and every member who has a question about B2M, depotting, washing makeup brushes, returns etc. These topics have been covered extensively before, can be solved via a visit the official MAC site, and/or are even in the Specktra.net FAQ forum. Not only will help you but it also helps the forums save bandwidth &amp; resources.<br>
<br>
<b>18) Termination of membership</b><br>
Should you decide you no longer wish to be a member it is important you understand your posts will remain on this board under your username. We do not delete user accounts, even when requested.<br>
<br>
Under no circumstances can we delete all posts made by a member - especially if the member has a substantial post count. This causes threads to become disjointed and illogical and diminishes the Board experience for everyone.<br>
<br>
<b>19) You are responsible</b><br>
You are responsible and liable for all your activities while participating in the Specktra Forum. Remember that you are responsible for anything you say or post.<br>
<br>
Once a post has been made on Specktra.net forum, unless it is brought to one of the moderators attention as being in breach of this user agreement, and is required to be edited or deleted, it is not a service we offer to remove users posts, therefore please consider your post carefully prior to making it.<br>
<br>
You are responsible for any actions you may take based on advice or information you receive online. Use your own good judgment when evaluating information provided through any Forum post, remember that the information provided could be from people from 16 and over and any experience level. The decision to conduct transactions with anyone is your own and you should conduct your own research prior to making any decisions.<br>
<br>
The Specktra Forum is moderated daily, with any undesirable or inappropriate posts edited or deleted and kept on file. Any user(s) seen to be repeatedly in breach of this user agreement, will have their Specktra Forum registration cancelled without prior warning.<br>
<br>
Specktra does not and cannot review all information posted to the website by users and is not responsible for such information. However, Specktra reserves the right to refuse to post and the right to remove any information, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever or for no reason.<br>
<br>
<b>20) Intellectual property</b><br>
The material used in conjunction with the Specktra.net Forum and Specktra.net website may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, cached or otherwise used, except with the prior written permission of Janice James, janice@specktra.net. This clause includes (but is not limited to) moderator private messages, forum threads and posts. If Specktra.net witnesses such reproduction; then legal action may take place as a result.<br>
<br>
<b>21) Reporting undesireable posts/users</b><br>

<br>
<b>22) Solicitations (SPAM)</b><br>
It is against board rules to invite, solicit or coerce others to join other community websites through posts, email, PM, use of Specktra membership list or any other resource within the Specktra website. Please note that advertisements, chain letters, pyramid schemes, and solicitations are inappropriate to personally post, send through PM, email or any other feature of the Specktra.Net website: message boards, blogs, gallery. Further, please do not use hotlinks to link to this site's graphics.<br>
<br>
<b>23) Safety &amp; Privacy</b><br>
The second you post a image on the internet it's free for the taking. If your image is up and you want it down, thats easily done, however even if the images are removed they can still be in the posession of others. It's called right click + save. So be aware that if you post an image, anyone can have it. Even though communities such as Specktra.Net do not support stalking one must keep in mind that people will be creeps and stalk anyway. Keep yourself safe. Do not publically post location, number, address, last name, or pictures of your neighborhood.<br>
<br>
<b>24) The administrative team @ Specktra.Net make the final decision on all banning.</b> Please be advised that the Specktra.Net team reserves the right to ban a user, at any time, without notice.<br>
<br>
<b>25) Copyright material</b><br>
You agree not to post any copyrighted material unless the copyright is owned by you or by Specktra.Net This includes text content, art or photos.<br>
<br>
<b>26) Public Flames/Hot Topics</b><br>
You agree, through your use of this service, that you will not make derogatory comments about any person based on religion, race, gender, etc. Please remember this is a large community with many members from all parts of the world, representing all people. Please refrain from posting messages that contain potential hot topics known as polarizing arguments. A tone of "kindness" is appreciated for all discussions.<br>
<br>
<b>27) Public Disagreements with Administration/Staff or Guidelines</b><br>

<br>
<b>28) Username/Account</b><br>

<br>
<b>29) Moving posts</b><br>
The staff of Specktra reserves the right to move your post from one forum category to another for the sole purpose of providing you with the best possible support for your needs. We believe it is important to keep your posts within the proper forum for your support needs as well as our visiting members reading. Additionally, please do not cross-post (posting the same message in more than one forum). Duplicate posts will be removed.<br>
<br>
<b>30) Clarification on advertising your e-commerce site</b><br>
You are not allowed to post your e-commerce website on this site. Specktra.net does have advertising space. If you would like to advertise on Specktra.net you can target the site via Google Adwords. You are permitted a discreet link to your business in your signature. Specktra administration retains the right to ultimate discretion on all e-commerce links. Shilling or advertising outside of the Clearance Bin is not allowed. Violators will be banned without warning.<br>
<br>

    <h2><b>Privacy Policy</b></h2>  Because Specktra.Net gathers certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.<br>
<br>
COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY<br>
This site is owned and operated by Specktra.Net. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. We want to make your online experience satisfying and safe.<br>
<br>
We invite you to contact us if you have questions about this policy. You may contact us by email at janice@specktra.net.<br>
<br>
Additional Information: Terms of Service<br>
<br>
INFORMATION THIS SITE GATHERS AND TRACKS<br>
Specktra.Net gathers two types of information about users:<br>
<br>
Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys:<br>
<br>
Information Specktra.Net gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because Specktra.Net derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships, advertisement and / or donations, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does Specktra.Net divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.<br>
<br>
Specktra.Net Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:<br>
<br>
Optional Voluntary Information<br>
<br>
We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:<br>
<br>
1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)<br>
We offer a free electronic newsletter to users. Specktra.Net gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.<br>
<br>
2. Message boards/forums<br>
Users of the site's Forums must register separately for these in order to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.<br>
<br>
3. "E-mail this to a friend" Service<br>
Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.<br>
<br>
4. Polling<br>
We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Specktra.Net may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.<br>
<br>
5. Surveys<br>
Specktra.Net may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.<br>
<br>
Children<br>
Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.<br>
<br>
Usage tracking<br>
Specktra.Net tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Specktra.Net does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).<br>
<br>
Specktra.Net sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.<br>
<br>
Cookies<br>
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Specktra.Net uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.<br>
<br>
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.<br>
<br>
USE OF INFORMATION<br>
<br>
Specktra.Net uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.<br>
<br>
As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. Specktra.Net never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.<br>
<br>
When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.<br>
<br>
Specktra.Net creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.<br>
   <br>
  We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a><br>
   <br>
  SHARING OF THE INFORMATION<br>
Specktra.Net uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We will not share information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.<br>
<br>

We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:<br>
<br>
