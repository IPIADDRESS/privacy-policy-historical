<p><strong>IP address</strong></p>
<p id="key_ipaddr">Every computer connected to the internet is assigned a unique number known as an internet protocol (IP) address. Since these numbers are usually assigned in country-based blocks, an IP address can often be used to identify the country, and in many cases a more precise location, from which a computer is connecting to the internet.</p>

<p id="key_pixel">A pixel, also known as a pixel tag or web beacon, is a small snippet of code embedded in a website.&nbsp; Pixels allow a website to transfer or collect information through a graphic image request.&nbsp; Pixels can be used count site visitations and conversions, gather broad-based user interest data, transmit to and receive information from third parties, deliver, read and write to cookies and for other purposes connected to the provision of advertising, analytics or other services.</p>

<p><strong>Server logs</strong></p>
<p id="key_servlo">Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>

<p><strong>Unique identifier</strong></p>
<p id="key_unid">A unique identifier is a string of characters that is used to recognize a user’s device, browser or other platform.&nbsp; Unique identifiers may be used in conjunction with or separate from cookies, including on platforms (e.g., certain mobile devices) where cookie technology is not available.</p>

<p><strong>User panel</strong></p>
<p id="key_uspa">Panel of internet users that agree to anonymous recording of their ad exposure activity as they browse the web and are exposed to video and display advertisements in exchange for free software and services such as browser toolbars, games, and applications that provide information services such as weather, travel, news.</p>

<p><strong>Web crawler</strong></p>
<p id="key_webcr">A sophisticated bot that renders webpages as a user would in order to analyze the page content and how ads deliver to users on a given webpage.</p>

<h1 class="anchor-offset" id="section_4">IV. Your choices</h1>
<ol>
<li class="anchor-offset" id="section_4_a"><strong>A. </strong><strong>Interest-based advertising opt-out</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We offer an “opt-out cookie” to block the placement of our behavioral advertising cookies on your system for five years from the time you opt out. When we detect our opt-out cookie on your browser, we do not serve you with interest-based advertising. The opt-out cookie is browser and device specific. Therefore, if you use multiple devices, multiple browsers or have multiple users on a single device, you will need to perform the opt-out operation for each device, browser and user. If you delete your cookies, change browsers, or use a different device, you will need to opt-out again. Browser settings that block all cookies may prevent this opt-out from operating correctly and certain privacy software may delete the opt-out cookie or cause it to function incorrectly. Furthermore, the opt-out cookie is not effective on devices that do not accept or otherwise support cookies, such as iOS based mobile devices, internet connected televisions and other non-cookie based connected devices and applications.</p>
<p>You may install our opt-out cookie by clicking the button below:</p>
               <p id="optout">
                       <img id="optout-status" src="http://notrack.specificmedia.com/new/CookieCheckTest.php?corp=1" usemap="#buttonmap" alt="optout" width="399" height="114">
                       <map id="buttonmap" name="buttonmap"><area shape="rect" coords="137, 33, 261, 74" style="cursor:pointer;"></map>
               </p>

<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>Please note that if you choose to opt-out of interest-based advertising, it does not mean you will no longer receive advertising on the internet. However, it does mean that the display advertising you see will not be behaviorally targeted by us to your interests or preferences, so long as the opt-out cookie remains in place. Further, except for the specific restrictions noted above, our opt-out cookies do not otherwise prevent us from continuing to collect, maintain or use information as described herein.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>B. </strong><strong>Platform and App-Based Opt-Out</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Opting out of behaviorally targeted advertisements associated with PC, mobile, or other digital platform applications (also referred to as “apps”) and internet connected devices, such as iOS based mobile phones, internet connected televisions and other non-cookie based connected device platforms, requires a different process than opting-out of browser-based behavioral targeting. Opting-out in this context requires you to follow the process implemented by the application owner, platform device manufacturer, or third-party advertising network partners that control the placement of ads on the relevant app, device or other platform. Opting out on these apps, devices and platforms is a third-party process, and we take no responsibility for the actions or inactions those third parties with respect to their respective opt-out mechanisms, if any.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>C. </strong><strong>Unsubscribe Opt-Out</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you would like to unsubscribe or opt-out of our use of your <a href="#" class="tiptip">personal information</a> that you have provided to us, all such unsubscribe or opt-out requests should be sent to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@interactivemediaholdings.com">privacy@interactivemediaholdings.com</a> and we will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. We are not responsible for removing your <a href="#" class="tiptip">personal information</a> from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy or your consent, such as a sponsor. You should contact such third parties directly.</p>

<h1 class="anchor-offset" id="section_6">VI. Health and financial related information</h1>
<p>We create non-sensitive health and financial related <a href="#" class="tiptip">interest-based segments</a> as part of our services, including general <a href="#" class="tiptip">interest-based segments</a> such as “Health::Medical Centers” and “Finance::Insurance,” and custom <a href="#" class="tiptip">interest-based segments</a> such as “Health::Dieting::Acai Berry” and “Health::Contact Lens.” However, we recognize that consumers may have differing opinions regarding which data segments are sensitive. Therefore, we encourage you to click <a href="#" class="tiptip modal_segments">here</a> for a list of our general health and financial related <a href="#" class="tiptip">interest-based segments</a>.

<h1 class="anchor-offset" id="section_7">VII. Children’s privacy</h1>
<p>We are very sensitive to the importance of children’s privacy. Our websites, products, and services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children. We do not knowingly employ or offer services or target advertising towards or collect information from children under the age of 13. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that children do not use our services and are not behaviorally targeted (<em>i.e.</em>, we do not knowingly provide targeted advertising to partner websites whose audience is comprised of primarily children under the age of 13), we cannot guarantee that your child will not be exposed to advertising provided by us, or that we have not received information related to your child’s online activities. If you believe your child has provided us with personally identifiable information, or registered at one of our websites, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@interactivemediaholdings.com">privacy@interactivemediaholdings.com</a> to have the data provided by and associated with your child deleted.</p>
<h1 class="anchor-offset" id="section_8">VIII. Storage in the United States</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the United States of America. Our servers are maintained in the United States of America. By using our services, you freely and specifically give us your consent to export your information to the USA and to store and use it in the USA as specified in this Privacy Policy. You understand that data stored in the USA may be subject to lawful requests by the courts or law enforcement authorities in the USA.</p>
<h1 class="anchor-offset" id="section_9">IX. Data retention</h1>
<p>We retain information that we collect and receive in non-aggregate form for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, which in many cases is 12 months or less from your last interaction with our products or services, unless a longer retention period is required by law or is necessary in order to comply with regulatory audits, court orders, legal proceedings, or law enforcement requests.</p>
<h1 class="anchor-offset" id="section_10">X. Changes to Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy in order to keep up with changing user needs, enhanced technologies, and as we develop new service offerings, and we may make changes to the policy accordingly. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “Effective Date” found at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>If we make any material changes to our privacy practices that may impact you, we will prominently post notice of the changes on our website(s) for a period of at least 30 days. We recommend that you check the Privacy Policy frequently to inform yourself of any changes.</p>
