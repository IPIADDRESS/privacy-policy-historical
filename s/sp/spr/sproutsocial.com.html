<p>

    In order to become a User (as defined in the Terms), You must provide us the following information to create an account: name, email address, company name
    and address, phone number, credit card information, Your Twitter username and authorization to access Your Twitter account.
</p>
<p>
    Sprout Social may request other information from You during or after the registration process that Sprout Social uses to provide better and more customized
    services to Users. You acknowledge that this information is personal to You, and by creating an account on Sprout Social, You may allow others, including
    Sprout Social, to identify You and to allow Sprout Social to use Your information in accordance with the Terms.
</p>
<p>
    B. <u>Customer Service</u>
</p>
<p>
    We collect information when You interact with Sprout Social’s customer service in order to accurately categorize and respond to customer inquiries and
    investigate breaches of Our terms.
</p>
<p>
    C. <u>Using Third Party Services and Visiting Third Party Sites</u>
</p>
<p>
    Information You provide to third-party sites/websites through the Service are not within the control of Sprout Social and You provide such information at
    Your own risk. The terms and conditions of use and the privacy policies of those websites that You provide information to through the Service will govern
    their use of such information. Any information You share with a third-party site through the Service will be collected by Sprout Social. Sprout Social will
    use such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    D. <u>Use of Cookies</u>
</p>
<p>
    The Site may send a "cookie" to Your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to Your browser from a web server and stored on Your
    computer's hard drive. A cookie cannot read data off Your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage Your system. Cookies
    allow us to recognize You as a user when You return to the Sprout Social website using the same computer and web browser. We use cookies to identify which
    areas of Our site You have visited, so the next time You visit the site, those pages may be readily accessible. We also may use this information to better
    personalize the content that You see on the Site. Most browser software can be set to reject Cookies. However, if You reject Our Cookies, certain
    functionality on the Site may not work correctly or at all. We do not link Non-Personal Information from Cookies to Your Personally Identifiable
    Information.
</p>
<p>
    In the course of optimizing the Service to Our Users, We may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on Your browser. Any
    information provided to third parties through cookies will not be personally identifiable, but may provide general segment information for the enhancement
    of Your user experience by providing more relevant advertising. Sprout Social does not store unencrypted personally identifiable information in the
    cookies.
</p>
<p>
    E. <u>Web Beacons</u>
</p>
<p>
    Sprout Social also may use web beacons, pixels, anonymous ad network tags, and cookies to collect Non-Personal Information about Your use of the Site and
    the websites of selected sponsors and advertisers, to collect anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers, and to collect data
    related to Your use of special promotions or newsletters. The information collected by Web Beacons also allows us to statistically monitor how many people
    open Our emails and for what purposes these actions are being taken. Our Web Beacons are not used to track Your activity outside of the Site or the
    websites of Our sponsors. We do not link Non-Personal Information from Web Beacons to Personally Identifiable Information without Your permission. However,
    because Your web browser requests advertisements and web beacons directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit or set their own cookies,
    just as if You had requested a web page from their site. If You are a non-registered Visitor to the Site, the only information We collect will be
    Non-Personal Information through the use of cookies or web beacons.
</p>
<p>
    F. <u>Log files, IP Addresses and information about Your computer and mobile device</u>
</p>
<p>
    Due to the communications standards on the internet, when You visit the Site We automatically receive the URL of the site from which You came and the site
    to which You are going when You leave Sprout Social’s Site. Sprout Social also receives the internet protocol (“IP”) address of Your computer (or the proxy
    server You use to access the World Wide Web), Your computer operating system and type of web browser You are using, email patterns, Your mobile device
    (including Your UDID) and mobile operating system (if You are accessing the Site using a mobile device), as well as the name of Your ISP or Your mobile
    carrier. Sprout Social may also receive location data passed to it from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that You have enabled. Also, as
    described above in Section 2.D. Sprout Social receives information when You access third-party web pages through the Service. The link between Your IP
    address and Your personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties without Your permission, except as described in Section 10.B.
    (“Compliance with Legal Process”), below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. Exemptions from Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any information You may send to Sprout Social by email or instant messaging programs (i.e. AOL, Yahoo, etc.), as email
    and instant messages are not recognized as secure communication forms. As such, We request that You do not send any information, which You consider
    private, to us by email or instant message. Furthermore, Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any information You post from Our Software to other websites
    (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, etc.), due to the public nature of such postings.
