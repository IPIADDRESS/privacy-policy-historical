<h1>About Spreety</h1>
<p>Spreety is a free, weekly updated, internet entertainment guide. 
 The core focus of Spreety is on high production quality U.S. video and audio content that is presented with a quality internet experience.
</p>
<p>Spreety links to ABC for ABC shows, CBS for CBS shows, etc., for the highest quality, legal experience.
 While Spreety is free, some of the links are marked with a $ to indicate pay-for sevices.
 </p>
<p>For most, Spreety is a useful way to catch a missed TV episode or revisit an old favorite.
 For some, Spreety may replace the DVR and/or cable TV.
</p>
<p>As a "Preferred" directory, some internet content does not appear, such as promotional clips or incomplete storylines.
The goal with such editing is to provide a concise, quality experience for our members.
</p>
<p>For advertisers, Spreety accepts banner ad placements through Google as well as special arrangements via direct contact.
</p>
    <p>
    Thank you for visiting Spreety!

    <p>
        Spreety is strongly committed to maintaining the privacy of your personal information
        and the security of our computer systems. With respect to the collection, use, and
        disclosure of personal information, Spreety makes every effort to ensure compliance
        with applicable Federal law.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a general rule, Spreety does not collect personally-identifying information about
        you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us.
        The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>If you visit our site to read or download information, we may collect and store the
            following information:</i>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The name of the domain from which you access the Internet. </li>
        <li>The Internet address of the website from which you linked directly
            to our site. </li>
        <li>The state and/or country from which you are connecting directly to
            our site. </li>
        <li>The Search Engine you used to connect directly to our site. </li>
    </ul>
    The above information is used by software programs on our website to create summary
    statistics which allow us to assess the number of visitors to the different sections
    of our site, identify what information is of most and least interest, determine
    technical design specifications, monitor system performance, and help us make our
    site more useful to visitors.
    <p>
        <i>If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail containing personal information:</i><br>
        You also may decide to send us personally identifying information, for example your
        mailing address, in an electronic mail message requesting that information be mailed

        <i>If you link to other sites outside the Spreety Website:</i><br>
        Our Website has many links to other sites. When you link to any of these sites,
        you are no longer on our site and are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Cookie Use Notice: </i>
        <br>
        The Spreety Website employs "cookies" to provide better service to its customers.
        Spreety does not use cookies to collect any personally identifying information from
        users or to track user activities beyond our web site. Spreety does not maintain
        copies of cookies on our servers after you leave our web site. Cookies are small
        pieces of data that are exchanged between a web site and a user's computer which
        enable a "session", or "dialog", to be established between the two machines. With
        the session established, Spreety is able to tailor its responses (i.e., identify
        and provide you with the information you want) and help you traverse our web pages
        in the most efficient and effective manner possible. The session is often broken
        when Spreety does not receive further requests from your computer or you simply
        exit your browser. Spreety does not use "session cookies", which are types of cookies
        that are temporarily stored in your computer's memory. Session cookies are normally
        deleted from a user's computer when the user logs off the computer or the user exits
        the browser. Spreety does issue "persistent cookies", types of cookies that could
        be stored permanently on your workstation and reused each time you visit the Spreety
        web site. Those cookies may be stored on some user's computers and, in some cases,
        may be updated by the user's browser when revisiting the Spreety web site. In the
        event a cookie is found on your workstation, which was issued from a Spreety web
        site, you may remove it without adversely affecting your future visits to our web
        site.
    </p>
    <p>
        For security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users,
        our website also employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify
        unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
        Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service
        are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse
        Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.
