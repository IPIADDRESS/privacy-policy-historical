          we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left">Because we 
          gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you 
          should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions 
          surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy

            are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to 
            participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and 
            from participation in polls and surveys:<br>

            Information 
            Spray Nine Corporation gathers through aggregated tracking 
            information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our 
            sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to 
            readers' needs and to help us better understand the demographics of 
            our audience. Under no circumstances does Spray Nine Corporation 
            divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.

          </ul>
          <p style="text-align: left">Spray Nine 
          Corporation Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</p>
          <p style="text-align: left">Optional 
          Voluntary Information</p>
          <p style="text-align: left">We offer the 
          following free services, which require some type of voluntary 
          submission of personal information by users:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: left">1. 
            Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)</p>
            <p style="text-align: left">We will 
            offer a free electronic newsletter to users. Spray Nine Corporation 
            gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. 
            Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the 
            link provided in every newsletter that points users to the 
            subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to the 
            newsletters at the time of registration.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left">2. Message 
            boards/forums policy</p>
            <p style="text-align: left">Users of 
            the site's Message Boards and Forums must register separately for 
            these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, 
            although they needn't register to visit the site. During 
            registration the user is required to supply a username, password, 
            and email address.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left">3. "E-mail 
            this to a friend" policy</p>
            <p style="text-align: left">Our site 
            users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or 
            documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The 
            user must provide their email address, as well as that of the 
            recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission 
            errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. 
            The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left">4. Polling</p>
            <p style="text-align: left">We may 
            offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their 
            opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about 
            important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are 
            aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Spray 
            Nine Corporation may use a system to "tag" users after they have 
            voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag 
            is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left">5. Surveys</p>
            <p style="text-align: left">Spray Nine 
            Corporation may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target 
            our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated 
            demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, 
            advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information 
            about specific individuals with any third party.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p style="text-align: left">Children</p>
          <p style="text-align: left">Consistent 
          with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), 
          we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information 
          from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left">Usage 
          tracking</p>
          <p style="text-align: left">Spray Nine 
          Corporation tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. 
          However, we do not correlate this information with data about 
          individual users. Spray Nine Corporation does break down overall usage 
          statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME 
          type by reading this information from the browser string (information 
          contained in every user's browser).</p>
          <p style="text-align: left">Spray Nine 
          Corporation sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users 
          enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated 
          with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which 
          areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those 
          areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well 
          each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better 
          service for you.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left">Cookies</p>
          <p style="text-align: left">We may place 
          a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. 
          The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it 
          will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you 
          have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal 
          information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A 
          cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created 
          by other sites. Spray Nine Corporation uses cookies to track user 
          traffic patterns (as described above). </p>
          <p style="text-align: left">You can 
          refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your 
          browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the 
          warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies 
          turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to 
          participate actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left"><b>
          
          USE OF INFORMATION</b></p>
          <p style="text-align: left">Spray Nine 
          Corporation uses any information voluntarily given by our users to 
          enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide 
          interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare 
          future content based on the interests of our users.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left">As stated 
          above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to 
          send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in 
          polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to 
          subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and 
          occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might 
          be particularly interested in something we are doing. Spray Nine 
          Corporation never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third 
          parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left">When we use 
          tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like 
          and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what 
          individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. 
          This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track 
          search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of 
          what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular 
          user enters.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left"><b>
          
          SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</b></p>
          <p style="text-align: left">Spray Nine 
          Corporation uses the above-described information to tailor our content 
          to suit your needs and help us better understand our audience's 
          demographics. We will not share information about individual users 
          with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid 
          legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the 
          public.</p>
