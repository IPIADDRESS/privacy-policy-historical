<h1>PsyBlog: Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective date: 03/04/2008</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the privacy  of Web users must be protected, and the most effective way to preserve that  privacy is to confine that data at the site level. PsyBlog collects no  personally identifiable data, and therefore protects user privacy while  eliminating an unnecessary costly feature. Please find below a  description of how PsyBlog strives to protect the privacy of Internet users,  and maintain the Internet as a highly credible medium.<br>
</p>
<p>User Information</p>
<p>All users who receive an  ad served by PsyBlog retain complete anonymity where PsyBlog is concerned. As  ads are delivered, PsyBlog does not acquire or collect any personal information  about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your  private property. PsyBlog does, however, collect information that is specific  to how you use the Internet. PsyBlog servers note non-personally identifying  details such as, but not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the  geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your  IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting  ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of PsyBlog clients and  customers.</p>
<p>There are instances where  a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad  containing a survey, purchase agreement, or registration questionnaire. For  such programs, PsyBlog (or a third party working in conjunction with PsyBlog  and the advertiser) acquires this information on behalf of the advertiser  client. The client uses this information to deliver the goods or services  requested by the user. When requested, PsyBlog may employ this information in a  compiled format without identifying users specifically to provide to the  advertiser client precise profiles of the types of individuals responding to  the ads.</p>
<p>The Cookie Principle</p>
<p>PsyBlog may use cookies to  improve your Web browsing experience. When you are first served a PsyBlog ad, PsyBlog  may assign a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as  a "cookie." We do this to understand the way a user responds to the  ads we deliver. For example, this number lets us keep track of how many times  you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do  not see the same ad over and over - thus enhancing your online Web viewing  experience. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any  personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. Most Web  browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser  to prevent that use if you desire.</p>
<p>Third-Party Measurement  Services</p>
<p>Often, advertisers will  employ a third-party service provider other than PsyBlog for serving the  advertisements and for tracking the performance of an ad program. These  companies may employ cookie and 1x1 pixel technology to measure and improve the  effectiveness of ads for their client. These companies may collect and use  anonymous information about your visits to our member Websites and other  Websites. The information collected can include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Date/time of your visit<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The banner ad that was shown<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Their cookie<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Your IP address<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The URLs of sites you visit</p>
<p>This information can also  be used for online preference marketing (“profiling”) purposes.</p>
<p>In these instances, PsyBlog  has no control over the information collected by the third-party, and may not  be held responsible for the actions of the third-party measurement service  where collected information is concerned.</p>
<p>We use third-party  advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies  may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address  or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to  provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>
<p>We do not share, sell,  rent or trade PII with third-parties for promotional purposes.</p>
<p>If you have any questions  about security on our Web site, you can email us at psyblogger---@---gmail---.---com</p>
