<div class="MsoNormal" style=" line-height: 10.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; background: white;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: #434343; font-size: 9pt;">Site Sponsor uses multiple levels of security regardless of the delivery channel you choose. We maintain personally identifying information in secure computer systems and we limit employee access to those with a business reason to see it. More specifically, employees may access information about you when needed to maintain your accounts or otherwise meet your needs. We safeguard information according to established security standards and procedures. Our employees are trained to understand and comply with these information principles.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style=" line-height: 10.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; background: white;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: #434343; font-size: 9pt;">Site Sponsor is protected by a system of filtering routers and firewalls, which form a barrier between the outside Internet and the internal network. The filtering router verifies the source and destination of each network packet, and determines whether or not to let the packet through. Access is denied if the packet is not directed at a specific, available service.</span></div>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=" line-height: 10.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; background: white;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: #434343; font-size: 9pt;">The firewall is used to shield Site Sponsor's client service network from the Internet. All incoming IP traffic is actually addressed to the firewall, which is designed to allow only e-mail into the client service environment. Traffic through the firewall is subjected to a special proxy process which operates in much the same way as a filtering router, verifying the source and destination of each information packet.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=" line-height: 10.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; background: white;">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=" line-height: 10.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; background: white;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: #434343; font-size: 9pt;">The proxy then changes the IP address of the packet to deliver it to the appropriate site within the client service network. In this way, all inside addresses are protected from outside access, and the structure of Site Sponsor 's internal networks is invisible to outside observers.</span></p>
