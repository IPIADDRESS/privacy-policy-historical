<div class="cms-richtext"><h3>1. Purpose of collecting and using data according to § 13 paragraph 1 of the Telemediengesetz (German Telemedia Act)</h3><p>Collecting your data serves to provide you with user-friendly, efficient and secure internet services. Springer-Verlag GmbH, Heidelberg, Zweigniederlassung der Springer-Verlag GmbH, Berlin, Tiergartenstrasse 17, D-69121 Heidelberg, Germany ( referred to as “Springer Nature” or “we” or “our” or “us”) uses the collected and processed personal data in order to provide those users who are interested with information. Furthermore, we generally process the data with the goal of improving our service and ensuring its security. No personal data is processed: we process the data anonymously or using pseudonyms.
