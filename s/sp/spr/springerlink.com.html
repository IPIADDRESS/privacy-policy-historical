                        <h2>III. Informational use of the website</h2>

                        <p>When you visit our website for informational reasons, i.e. without registering for any of our provided services listed under IV and without providing us with personal data in any other form, we may automatically collect additional information about you which will contain personal data only in limited cases and which is automatically

                        <p>If you are identified by IP or equivalent method as belonging to a customer organisation such as university or a company then we will also collect the identity of that organisation and use it to create usage reports which show the organisation how much of the content we publish is being read by their students, members or employees.

                        <h3>a) Facebook Social Plugins</h3>
                        <p>We use so-called social plugins („plugins“) of the social networking site facebook.com provided
                            by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). The plugins can
                            be identified by one of Facebook’s logos (white “f” on blue tile or a “thumps-up”-sign) or by
                            the additional text “Facebook Social Plugin”. The list of Facebook Social Plugins and their
                            appearance can be accessed via: <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/plugins">http://developers.facebook.com/plugins</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>If a user visits one of the websites using such a plugin, the user’s browser directly
                            connects to Facebook’s servers. The plugin and its content are made available directly on
                            Facebook’s servers and included in the website by the user’s browser.</p>
                        <p>Due to the integration of the plugin Facebook collects the information that a user is visiting
                            the corresponding
                            website. If the user is logged in on Facebook at the moment he or she visits the website,
                            Facebook may be able to connect the visit on the website to the user’s Facebook account. If the
                            user interacts with the plugin – for example if he or she presses the like button or comments on
                            something – the user’s browser transmits this information to Facebook. Facebook stores this
                            information. If a user is not a member of Facebook, Facebook may collect and store the user’s
                            IP-address. Facebook states that it only collects anonymized IP-addresses in Germany.</p>
                        <p>The reason for and scope of the data acquisition and information about the way in
                            which the data is processed and used by Facebook, as well as the user’s rights in this
                            respect
                            and settings options for protecting the users privacy can be found under: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">http://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the user is a member of Facebook and does not wish Facebook to collect personal data via
                            this
                            homepage and to link this with his data stored on Facebook, the user needs to log off from
                            Facebook before going to this homepage.</p>
                        <p>The user may also block Facebook’s
                            plugins using add-ons for the user’s browser, for example the „Facebook Blocker“.</p>
                        <h3>b) Google’s +1-button</h3>
                        <p>We use the “+1”-button of the social network Google Plus provided by Google Inc., 1600
                            Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (“Google”). The button is
                            market using the sign “+1” on a white or colored background.</p>
                        <p>If a user visits one of the websites using such a button, the user’s browser directly
                            connects to Google’s servers. The “+1”-button and its content are loaded directly from
                            Google’s servers and included in the website by the user’s browser. According to Google’s
                            statements, personal data is only collected, if a user that is a Google Plus member and
                            logged in on the network at the time of clicking on the “+1”-button.</p>
                        <p>The reason for and scope of the data acquisition and information about the way in which the
                            data is processed and used by Google, as well as the user’s rights in this respect and
                            settings
                            options for protecting the users privacy can be found in Google’s privacy statement

                        </p>
                        <h3>c) Twitter</h3>
                        <p>We use the twitter-button. The button is provided by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600,
                            San
                            Francisco, CA 94107, USA. (“Twitter”) The buttons are marked using the text “Twitter” or
                            “Follow” and a stylized blue bird. The button enables the user to share an article or a
                            website
                            of this homepage on Twitter or to follow the provider on Twitter.</p>
                        <p>If a user visits one of the websites using such a button, the user’s browser directly
                            connects to
                            Twitter’s servers. The Twitter-button and its content are loaded directly from Twitter’s
                            servers
                            and included in the website by the user’s browser. According to the provider’s knowledge,
                            Twitter collects the user IP-address and the website’s URL when the button is loaded from
                            Twitter’s servers. However, this data is only be used for loading and displaying the
                            Twitter-button.</p>
