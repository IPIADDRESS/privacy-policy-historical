knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we 
appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice 
describes our privacy policy. By visiting Sprysoft, you are accepting the 
practices described in this Privacy Notice. <br><br><b>What Personal Information 
About Customers Does Sprysoft Gather?</b><br>The information we learn from 
customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience 
at Sprysoft. Here are the types of information we gather. 
<li>Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on 
our Web site or give us in any other ways. We use the information that you 
provide for such purposes as communicating with you, customizing the shopping 
experience for you, responding to your requests, and improving our site. 
</li><li>Eligibility Information: For many products purchased from Sprysoft, we are 
required to collect proof of Academic eligibility. This may include a copy of 
your Academic ID, Driver's License, proof of enrollment, etc. 
</li><li>Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information 
whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use cookies, 
and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses 
Sprysoft. 
</li><li>E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, 
we may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Sprysoft if your 
computer supports such capabilities.

</a></li><li><a name="nospam">NO SPAM Policy: We will not send you any unsolicited emails nor will we sell your email address to any other entity. If you feel that you have received an email in error, please contact us at </a><a class="reglink" href="mailto: abuse@sprysoft.com">abuse@sprysoft.com</a>. 
</li><li>Information from Other Sources: For reasons such as improving 
personalization of our service (for example, providing better product 
recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you), we might 
receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account 
information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information 
from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and 
deliver your next purchase or communication more easily. <br><br><b>What About 
Cookies? </b><br>
</li><li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's 
hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your 
browser and to provide special features and storage of items in your Shopping 
Cart between visits. 
</li><li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to 
prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify 
you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. 
However, cookies allow you to shop at Sprysoft, and we recommend that you leave 
them turned on. <br><br><b>Does Sprysoft Share the Information It 
Receives?</b><br>Information about our customers is an important part of our 
business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share 
customer information only with the subsidiaries Sprysoft Corporation controls 
and as described below. 
</li><li>Suppliers: Sprysoft may allow our suppliers from time to time to verify that 
the software that we sold you was going to an Academically eligible party. These 
documents will not leave Sprysoft premises and they will not be used for 
marketing purposes by any other company. 
</li><li>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with our affiliated 
businesses. In some cases, these businesses operate stores linked from Sprysoft 
or sell offerings to you at Sprysoft. In other cases, we operate stores, provide 
services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. 
</li><li>Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on 
our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending 
postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, 
analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, 
and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed 
to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
</li><li>Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or 
buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is 
one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that 
Sprysoft Corporation or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer 
information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
</li><li>Protection of Sprysoft and Others: We release account and other personal 
information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law or protect 
the rights, property, or safety of Sprysoft, our users, or others. This includes 
exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud 
protection and credit risk reduction. 
</li><li>With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when 
information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an 
opportunity to choose not to share the information. <br><br><b>How Secure Is 
Information About Me? </b><br>
</li><li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by 
using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 

</li><li>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when 
confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the 
appropriate credit card company during order processing. </li>
