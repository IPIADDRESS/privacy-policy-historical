<h2>SpringWidgets Privacy  Policy</h2>
	<a name="_DV_C1" id="_DV_C1"><em>Effective as of March 21, 2006</em></a>
<p><a name="_DV_M1" id="_DV_M1"></a>Fox  Interactive Media, Inc. ("FIM") is part of the News America Group,  which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles<a name="_DV_C2" id="_DV_C2"> </a> <a name="_DV_M2" id="_DV_M2"></a>available at <a name="OLE_LINK6" id="OLE_LINK6"></a><a name="OLE_LINK5" id="OLE_LINK5">http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html</a> applicable  to all its U.S.-based companies. &nbsp;FIM  operates the Internet Web site located at www.thespringbox.com.&nbsp; FIM has implemented those Principles in this  Privacy Policy, which describes how&nbsp; we  collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we  obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S.&nbsp; FIM operates general audience Web sites, and  does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age.<a name="_DV_M4" id="_DV_M4"></a> From time to time, FIM may revise this Privacy Policy to  reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use  practices, the features of our Web sites or technology. &nbsp;If we make revisions that change the way we  collect or use your PII, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy  and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of this Policy. <a name="_DV_M5" id="_DV_M5"></a>&nbsp;Therefore, you should  review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies  and practices<a name="_DV_M6" id="_DV_M6"></a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;If  FIM materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII,  your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was  collected unless you have been provided notice of and have not objected to the  change.<a name="_DV_M7" id="_DV_M7"></a></p>
<p><strong>COLLECTION:  COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY FIM.</strong> <br>
	<a name="_DV_M8" id="_DV_M8"></a><strong>General</strong>. FIM  collects personally identifiable information ("PII" -- that is,  information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone  number) <a name="_DV_M9" id="_DV_M9"></a>in order to create or enhance our relationship  with you. When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily  submitting the information to us in order to participate in activities like  sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, in  connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin  boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or  information.<a name="_DV_C9" id="_DV_C9"> &nbsp;We may  also</a><a name="_DV_M10" id="_DV_M10"></a> obtain PII from <a name="_DV_M11" id="_DV_M11"></a>reputable <a name="_DV_C12" id="_DV_C12">third parties. </a><a name="_DV_M12" id="_DV_M12"></a></p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong>.  Cookies are small bits of information that the FIM Web<a name="_DV_M14" id="_DV_M14"></a> sites place on the hard drive of your computer. &nbsp;Cookies remember information about your  activities on our site(s) and enable FIM to make your visits to our site(s)  more enjoyable. &nbsp;For example, cookies can  store your password for easy logon to a site you have previously visited, can  save your preferences for a personalized home page or can  track the items you have placed in your "shopping cart" during a  visit to our online store.&nbsp; Information  about your activities on FIM sites and other non-personally identifiable  information about you may also be used to limit the online ads you encounter to  those we believe are consistent with your interests.<a name="_DV_M16" id="_DV_M16"></a></p>
<p><a name="_DV_M17" id="_DV_M17"></a>Third  party advertisements displayed on <a name="_DV_M18" id="_DV_M18"></a>FIM<a name="_DV_C19" id="_DV_C19"> sites</a><a name="_DV_M19" id="_DV_M19"></a> may also contain cookie<a name="_DV_C20" id="_DV_C20">s set  by Internet advertising companies or advertisers.&nbsp; </a><a name="_DV_M20" id="_DV_M20"></a>FIM does not  control these <a name="_DV_M21" id="_DV_M21"></a>cookies and visitors to our Web site(s)  should check the privacy policy of the<a name="_DV_C22" id="_DV_C22"> Internet advertising  company or </a><a name="_DV_M22" id="_DV_M22"></a><br>
	advertiser  to see whether and how it uses cookies. &nbsp;See  the "Notice" section below for more information on third party  advertisements. <br>
	<a name="_DV_M23" id="_DV_M23"></a>FIM may  use cookie<a name="_DV_M24" id="_DV_M24"></a>s and similar tools to relate your use of our  Web site(s) to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example,  if you've asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or  promotions, cookie and/or click stream data<a name="_DV_M27" id="_DV_M27"></a> about your <a name="_DV_M28" id="_DV_M28"></a>activities<a name="_DV_C33" id="_DV_C33"> on FIM Web sites </a><a name="_DV_M29" id="_DV_M29"></a>may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items  we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and  preferences. &nbsp;However, if FIM wishes to  combine your personal and cookie or click stream<a name="_DV_M33" id="_DV_M33"></a> information  in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative <a name="_DV_M34" id="_DV_M34"></a>consent.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a name="_DV_M36" id="_DV_M36"></a>You can  program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse  cookies completely. &nbsp;However, without  cookies you may not have access to certain features on News America Group’s Web  site(s), such as the Fox Movie Channel Backlot. </p>
<p><a name="_DV_M37" id="_DV_M37"></a><strong>NOTICE: FIM  WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES</strong> <br>
	<a name="_DV_M38" id="_DV_M38"></a>When you  voluntarily provide <a name="_DV_M39" id="_DV_M39"></a>PII to FIM<a name="_DV_M40" id="_DV_M40"></a>, we  will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how  and why the information is being collected and the types of uses FIM will make  of the information.&nbsp; At the time you  provide your PII, FIM will notify you of your options regarding our use of your  PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See “Choice”  below).<a name="_DV_M41" id="_DV_M41"></a>&nbsp; This  Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you  information about their products and services and therefore may want to share  your personal informatio<a name="_DV_C50" id="_DV_C50">n, provided you have given FIM  permission to do so </a><a name="_DV_M42" id="_DV_M42"></a>(See "Use" below). </p>
<p><a name="_DV_M43" id="_DV_M43"></a>Sometimes  we collect PII from consumers in manual forma<a name="_DV_C52" id="_DV_C52">t or off-line,</a><a name="_DV_M44" id="_DV_M44"></a> such as a post card or subscription form. &nbsp;Providing detailed notice in those situations  often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short  notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other  relevant information from us. </p>
<p><a name="_DV_M45" id="_DV_M45"></a>FIM’s  Web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some  of these third party sites may be co-branded with a FIM logo, even though they  are not operated or maintained by FIM (for example, the co-sponsored chat  pages, or advertising sponsor pages). &nbsp;FIM's  Web site(s) also carry advertisements from other companies<a name="_DV_M46" id="_DV_M46"></a>.  &nbsp;FIM is not responsible for the privacy  practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our <a name="_DV_M48" id="_DV_M48"></a><a name="_DV_M49" id="_DV_M49"></a>sites or for the privacy practices of  third party or <a name="_DV_M50" id="_DV_M50"></a>national Internet advertising companies.  Once you've left a FIM site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement,  you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser  site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you. </p>
<p>FIM’s  Web site(s) may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with FIM  &nbsp;(i.e., that are part of the News America  Group). Although all News America Group entities adhere to the group’s Privacy  Principles located at http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html, visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to  their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some  respects from this Policy.&nbsp; <a name="_DV_M52" id="_DV_M52"></a></p>
<p>Some of  the advertisements that appear on FIM's Web site(s) are delivered to you by  national Internet advertising companies such as Doubleclick and 24/7Real Media.  These companies <a name="_DV_M54" id="_DV_M54"></a>utilize certain technologies to deliver  advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information  about your visit to our sites, including information about the banner ads they  display, any cookie they place on your computer and your IP address.

<p>FIM may also enter into agreements with outside companies  that possess the technology that allows FIM to customize the advertising and  marketing messages you receive on our Web sites.&nbsp; Your non-PII and click stream data about your  activities on our sites may be shared with these companies so this customization  can be accomplished.&nbsp; These companies  will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other  purpose.&nbsp; Anonymous click stream and  demographic information may also be shared with FIM’s advertisers and business  partners.</p>
<p><a name="_DV_M74" id="_DV_M74"></a>There may be instances when FIM  may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the  legal rights of FIM, other companies within the News America Group or their  employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors  to our Web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or  to comply with the law or legal process. &nbsp;In addition, if FIM sells all or part of its  business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a  merger or business transfer, FIM may transfer your PII to a third party as part  of that transaction. </p>
<p><a name="_DV_M75" id="_DV_M75"></a><strong>SECURITY: FIM PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII </strong><br>
