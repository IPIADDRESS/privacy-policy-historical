We do not exercise control over the sites that include Spreecast applications, products or services, or links from within our various services.

<p>In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect to:</p>
<p>Provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services (including advertising services) and develop new services; and</p>
<p>Protect the rights or property of Spreecast or our users.</p>
<p>If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>
<p>Spreecast processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information outside your own country.</p>

<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Spreecast features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Childrens’ Privacy</strong><br>
Spreecast does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age. The Spreecast service is intended for a general audience and is not in any way targeted to children under 13 years of age. If any parent, guardian, or other person becomes aware that a child under the age of 13 has submitted any information to Spreecast or Spreecast has otherwise posted or obtained any information about a child under the age of 13, please notify us by emailing us at customerservice@spreecast.com or call us at (415) 484-6706 and we will take appropriate steps to remove and/or delete the information.</p>
<p><strong>Information sharing</strong><br>
Spreecast only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Spreecast in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<p>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</p>
<p>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<p>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Spreecast, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>If Spreecast becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, your personal information may be transferred and become subject to a different privacy policy. We will notify you if and when any such transaction is completed if we have a valid email address for you.</p>
<p><strong>Information security</strong><br>
We restrict access to personal information to Spreecast employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page. Your continued use of the Spreecast services signifies your compliance with the then-current privacy policy.</p>

<p><strong>Your Spreecast Account.</strong> For some activities on Spreecast, like creating a show or broadcast or making comments, you need a Spreecast Account. We ask for some personal information when you create an account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.</p>

If you submit personal information to Spreecast, we may use that information to operate, maintain, and improve the features and functionality of Spreecast, and to process any flagging activity, broadcasts or other communication you send to us.</p>

<p>You may control the information that is available to other users at any time by editing your Spreecast privacy settings.</p>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through Spreecast, in which case you can still view videos or broadcasts and explore Spreecast, but Spreecast may not be able to provide certain services to you.</p>

Spreecast strives to provide you with relevant and useful advertising. We may use a range of information including cookies, web beacons, IP addresses, usage data and other information about your activity online, computer or device (such as browser type and operating system) or other information to provide you with relevant advertising. While you are logged in or logged out of your Spreecast Account, we may also show you advertising based on information you have provided to us in your Spreecast Account.</p>
<p>We may use various cookies on Spreecast to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads on this site and other Spreecast products and services. Advertisers may serve ads based on interests and demographic categories associated with non-personally identifiable online activity, such as videos viewed, shows created or other activity.
