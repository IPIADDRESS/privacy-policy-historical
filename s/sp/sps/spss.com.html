<p><a name="1">1. What information does SPSS gather and track?</a></p></font></i></b>
<p>SPSS gathers two types of information about our site visitors: data that visitors provide through optional, voluntary registration on our site and in certain contests and sweepstakes; and data SPSS gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. Such information enables us to tailor our content better to readers" needs and to understand the demographics of our audience better. SPSS will never divulge information about you to a third party without your express consent.</p>
<p>SPSS gathers visitor information in the following processes: </p>
<ul><b>
    <li>Optional registration</li></b></ul>
<p>SPSS offers free, voluntary registration to our site visitors. When you register, SPSS stores the information you provide on a secure server behind our firewall. By registering, you can take advantage of personalization (the ability to select content according to a user-supplied profile) and reduce the amount of information you provide for repeated transactions. For example, you will not have to provide standard personal contact information (name, e-mail address, 
phone, etc.) on each form you complete for downloading files, ordering products or requesting information or support. During registration, you are required to supply a first name, last name, e-mail address, phone number and country. You must also select a username and password that will be required for subsequent 
logins. In addition, you can opt to subscribe to various SPSS electronic newsletters. </p>
<ul><b>
    <li>Polling</li></b></ul>
<p>From time to time, SPSS sites offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what the SPSS audience thinks about important issues. SPSS uses a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>
<ul><b>
    <li>Electronic newsletters</li></b></ul>
<p>SPSS offers you free electronic newsletters. In order for us to deliver these newsletters, SPSS gathers your e-mail address when you voluntarily subscribe. You may remove yourself from these e-mail lists by following the link provided in every newsletter that points you to the subscription management page for the respective newsletter.</p>
<ul><b>
    <li>Contests and sweepstakes</li></b></ul>
<p>SPSS occasionally offers on our Web site contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. At a minimum, the required information includes name and e-mail address; in some cases, you may be required to answer mandatory survey questions about a range of other personal data. The information gathered in the 
entry form is used to verify your identity, to send you an e-mail notification that your entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. SPSS will never divulge this information to a third party without your express consent. Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information about each contest is clearly posted during the event. All contests 
and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws.</p>
<ul><b>
    <li>Usage tracking</li></b></ul>
<p>SPSS tracks visitor traffic patterns throughout our sites. We collect information to improve the overall quality of our site and to enhance the visitor's experience. We collect the visitor's domain name, referral data (e.g., the address of the last URL visited prior to clicking through to an SPSS Web site), browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape 4.x browser on Windows 97). SPSS breaks down overall usage statistics according to this information; however, we do not correlate this information with data about individuals.</p>
<ul><b>
    <li>Cookies</li></b></ul>
<p>A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information, such as a user ID, that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. SPSS uses cookies to track visitor traffic patterns.</p>
<ul><b>
    <li>Ads</li></b></ul>
<p>SPSS" advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any SPSS site.</p>
<ul><b>
    <li>Online purchases</li></b></ul>
<p>When you purchase products from our Web site, we may require a credit card number. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, an Internet standard for secure transactions, to transmit this information over the Internet to SPSS. Once we have your information, we enter it into another, separate ordering system. For your security, your credit card information is never stored in our 
Web database.</p><b><i><font face="Arial">
<p><a name="2">2. What does SPSS do with the information it gathers and tracks?</a></p></font></i></b>
<p>SPSS uses any information voluntarily given by you to enhance your experience in our site, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our visitors.</p>
<ul>
    <li>As stated above, SPSS uses information that you voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable you to participate in polls and contests. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a periodic basis, which varies according to the content you choose to receive. We occasionally send out special communications when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing or a product or service we are offering. It is our policy to send e-mail only to visitors who give    us permission to do so. In every such e-mail, we will give you instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you will not receive any future e-mails from SPSS if you do not wish to (for more information, see the "opt-out"section, #4, below). SPSS never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including business partners.</li>
    <li>We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites visitors like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.</li>
    <li>In certain sections, you may elect to tell us things that you want us to remember. We hope that, like many of our visitors, you will want to provide information about yourself so that SPSS can make our Web site more valuable to you. If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, we can provide you enhanced services that are not available to anonymous users. For example, we can alert you to special offers on products and services, or we could inform you when there is a training course in your area.</li>
    <li>SPSS creates aggregate reports on visitor demographics and traffic patterns. This allows our visitors to receive special offers and advertisements that are pertinent to their needs.</li></ul><b><i><font face="Arial">
<p><a name="3">3. With whom does SPSS share the information it gathers and tracks via its Web site?</a></p></font></i></b>
<p>SPSS uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and to understand our audience's demographics better. We do not share information about you gathered from our Web site with any third party without your express consent.</p><b><i><font face="Arial">
<p><a name="4">4. How can I opt-out of receiving electronic communication from SPSS?</a></p></font></i></b>
<p>SPSS gives you options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters when registering for a site</li>
    <li>Opting not to provide certain personal information when registering for a site or when participating in some contests</li>
    <li>Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from you</li></ul><b><i><font face="Arial">
<p><a name="5">5. How can I correct and update my personal information and preferences?</a></p></font></i></b>
<p>SPSS offers you the ability to correct and update the information collected during registration for our site. The instructions for doing this can be found in our Customer Services area at <a href="/service/">http://www.spss.com/service/</a>. 
 You may change this information at any time and as often as necessary. In addition to changing your personal registration information, you may also change your e-mail subscription status to 
receive or not receive e-mail newsletters and other types of e-mail 
communication from SPSS Inc. If you are experiencing problems or have any questions about how our services work, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@spss.com">webmaster@spss.com</a>

<p><a name="6">6. How can I delete or deactivate my name from the SPSS Web database?</a></p></font></i></b>

at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter. (To quickly see a list of all SPSS electronic newsletters, go to <a href="/newsltrs/">http://www.spss.com/newsltrs/</a>.)

e-mail to <a href="mailto:webmaster@spss.com">webmaster@spss.com</a> or regular mail to SPSS Customer Service, 233 S. Wacker Drive, 11<sup>th</sup> floor, Chicago, IL 60606, USA, or by calling 1-800-543-2185.</p><b><i><font face="Arial"><p><a name="7">7.
