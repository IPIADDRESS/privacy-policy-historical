					using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers 
					that may help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools may also prevent 
					children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information 
					without parental permission. Personal information about or obtained from a child will 
					not be used for commercial or trade purposes without the prior written consent of a 
					parent or legal guardian of the child.<br><br>
