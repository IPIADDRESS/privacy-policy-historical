<h2>
	2 What information do we collect?</h2>
<p>
	<a name="_Toc247645124"></a></p>
<h3>
	2.1 Personal Information</h3>
<p>
	In general, the personal information we collect about you includes (but is not limited to) your name, contact details (including phone numbers and addresses) and your questions about various aspects of the information provided on the website and your comments.</p>
<p>
	We will not collect any personally identifiable information about you through our website unless you provide it to us voluntarily.</p>
<p>
	The information we collect varies, depending on how you use our Site. This Policy applies to all information collected or submitted to the Site.

When you use your computer to request to view a page from a server, that server logs your IP address. SSRF does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. Your visit to the Site will be logged; however, you will remain anonymous to us unless you choose to share information with us. We track the number of people that view each page of our website to better understand which features are most popular and best meet the needs of our visitors.</p>
<p>
	To the extent this information does not constitute personal information, the National Privacy Principles do not apply and we may use this information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever.</p>

		<p>

	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>How long do we hold the information?</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		We will keep your information in our systems till we deem it necessary to purge it from our systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Use of cookies</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>What is a cookie?:</strong> A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the Site to your interests.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Control over a cookie: </strong>Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last option means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Site’s features. Each Internet browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. During the course of any visit to SSRF, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>How does the SSRF use your cookies:</strong> Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. In our effort to provide you with services customised to your interests, we use "cookies" to assist in the collection of information. When you register, we use a cookie to store a unique, random user ID.
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					We and other third party providers that we commission, use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you visit on our site. Tracking information such as cookies is also used to create aggregate reports on user demographics and Site traffic patterns. Information supplied by cookies can help us to provide you with a better online user experience and assist us to analyse the profile of our visitors.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					We use cookies to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver better and more personalized services; identify which areas of the Site you have visited; all as part of our efforts to streamline your experience on the Site.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			We need to respond to valid legal process. This includes a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, and any other instance when we believe we are required to provide information by law.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere, on or to the Site or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on the Site, the SSRF can use whatever information that is available to it about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties such as your Internet provider and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.</p>
