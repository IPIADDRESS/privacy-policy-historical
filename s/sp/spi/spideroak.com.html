<h1>Privacy Policy.</h1>

<h2>SpiderOak, Inc. Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Thank you for visiting SpiderOak, Inc.'s (“SpiderOak”)
Internet web site (“Site”) located at the URL SpiderOak.com. This
privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) details certain policies
implemented throughout SpiderOak governing SpiderOak's use of
Personally-Identifiable Data about users of our Site and users of our backup
and data storage services (the “Services”).</p>

<p><b>Privacy Policy Updates</b></p>

<p>Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, SpiderOak may need to
update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If so, SpiderOak will post its
updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at SpiderOak.com and notify you of
the updated posting.  SpiderOak encourages you to review this Privacy Policy
regularly for any changes.  Your continued use of this Site and/or continued
provision of Personally-Identifiable Data to us will be subject to the terms of
the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>

of “Personally-Identifiable Data”.  Additionally, by accessing the
Site or using the Services, we might collect additional data as set forth below
in the “Aggregate Information” paragraph.</p>

<p>We may use your Personally-Identifiable Data to register you to use our

agency to send advertising to you on our behalf.  Such third party entities

and from using your Personally-Identifiable Data for commercial purposes and

believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government
authority.  We will not sell your Personally-Identifiable Data to any company
or organization except we may transfer your Personally-Identifiable Data to a
