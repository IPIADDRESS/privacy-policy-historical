<p class="bigger">Thank you for visiting SpiderOak, Inc.'s (“SpiderOak”)
Internet web site (“Site”) located at the URL spideroak.com. This
privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) details certain policies
implemented throughout SpiderOak governing SpiderOak's use of
Personally-Identifiable Data about users of our Site and users of our backup
and data storage services (the “Services”).</p>

<p class="bigger"><strong class="small_gold">Privacy Policy Updates</strong></p>

<p class="bigger">Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, SpiderOak may need to
update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If so, SpiderOak will post its
updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at spideroak.com and notify you of
the updated posting.  SpiderOak encourages you to review this Privacy Policy
regularly for any changes.  Your continued use of this Site and/or continued
provision of Personally-Identifiable Data to us will be subject to the terms of
the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>

<p class="bigger"><strong class="small_gold">Information Collection and Use</strong></p>

<p class="bigger">You can generally visit our Site without revealing any
Personally-Identifiable Data about yourself.  In order to use the Services,
however, we will collect personally identifiable information, such as your
name, address, email address, phone number, username, credit card
number, and other information (“Personally-Identifiable Data”).
Additionally, we may invite you to participate in surveys, questionnaires or
contests, contact us with questions or comments or provide us with feedback,
which due to the nature of some of these activities, may include the collection
of “Personally-Identifiable Data”.  Additionally, by accessing the
Site or using the Services, we might collect additional data as set forth below
in the “Aggregate Information” paragraph.</p>

<p class="bigger">We may use your Personally-Identifiable Data to register you to use our

personally identify you.</p>

<p class="bigger"><strong class="small_gold">Aggregate Information</strong></p>

<p class="bigger">The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of
visitors to each page of our Site, browser type, and IP addresses, and we may
analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such

<p class="bigger">We may provide your Personally-Identifiable Data and the data generated by
cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that
we may engage to assist us in providing our Services to you.  For example, we
may provide your Personally-Identifiable Data to a credit card processing
company to process your payment or to a marketing, research and/or advertising
agency to send advertising to you on our behalf.  Such third party entities
will be restricted from further distributing your Personally-Identifiable Data
and from using your Personally-Identifiable Data for commercial purposes and
may be obligated to a written confidentiality agreement that is at least as
protective of your Personally-Identifiable Data as the terms of this Privacy
Policy.  We will disclose your Personally-Identifiable Data if we reasonably
believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government
authority.  We will not sell your Personally-Identifiable Data to any company
or organization except we may transfer your Personally-Identifiable Data to a
successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization
in which SpiderOak participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all
of SpiderOak's assets to which this Site relates.</p>
