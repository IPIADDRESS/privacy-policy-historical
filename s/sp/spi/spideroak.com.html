<h1>Privacy Policy.</h1>

<h2>SpiderOak, Inc. Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Thank you for visiting SpiderOak, Inc.'s (“SpiderOak”)
Internet web site (“Site”) located at the URL spideroak.com. This
privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) details certain policies
implemented throughout SpiderOak governing SpiderOak's use of
Personally-Identifiable Data about users of our Site and users of our backup

<p><b>Privacy Policy Updates</b></p>

<p>Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, SpiderOak may need to

updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at spideroak.com and notify you of
the updated posting.  SpiderOak encourages you to review this Privacy Policy
regularly for any changes.  Your continued use of this Site and/or continued
provision of Personally-Identifiable Data to us will be subject to the terms of
the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>

authority.  We will not sell your Personally-Identifiable Data to any company
