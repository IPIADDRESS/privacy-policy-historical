						<br>Last Updated:  December 11, 2006  
						<br>  
						<br>The Spiceworks Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal and company information when you use Spiceworks products and services, including information provided when you use the Spiceworks Desktop and its associated website. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your information.  
						<br>  
						<br>  
						<b>Why we collect information  
						</b>  
						<br>We collect information because it helps us deliver the absolute best product experience we possibly can. It is one of our core beliefs that we can only achieve that goal with your help. Gathering this information enables us to provide you with convenient and accurate information about products and services. In addition, this information helps us to keep you posted on the latest product announcements, software updates, and support information in a timely fashion. Most importantly, this information allows us to tune the product experience over time, optimizing our service based on your feedback and how you actually use the service.  
						<br>  
						<br>  
						<b>What information we collect  
						</b>  
						<br>The Spiceworks Desktop automatically discovers the hardware and software installed on your computer network. The information gathered is limited to configuration information about these hardware devices and software applications. It   
						<b>does not  
						</b> gather any non-systems related information such as personal files and content, application specific data files and content, common user directories or other user data and documents. <b>All of this configuration information is stored locally</b> in a file on your computer in an encoded format. Access to this file is password protected using the operating systems access control mechanisms. <b>None of this configuration information is sent to, or stored at, Spiceworks</b>. This file and its contents 
						<b>are not  
						</b> made accessible through the Spiceworks Desktop to Spiceworks.  
						<br>  
						<br>When you sign up for a Spiceworks Account, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Spiceworks services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.   
						<br>  
						<br>From time to time, the Spiceworks Desktop does collect a limited amount of anonymous aggregate information about your computing environment. This information is collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user, device, or software application. No device-specific or software-specific information is stored at Spiceworks.   
						<br>  
						<br>Your copy of the Spiceworks Desktop includes a unique application number. When you install the Spiceworks Desktop, this number and a message indicating whether the installation succeeded or failed, is sent back to Spiceworks. Also, when the Spiceworks Desktop automatically checks to see if a new version is available, the current version number and the unique application number are sent to Spiceworks. The unique application number is required for Spiceworks Desktop to function properly and cannot be disabled.  
						<br>  
						<br>Spiceworks uses cookies and other common web technologies to enhance your online experience and to learn about how you use Spiceworks services in order to improve the quality of our services. As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes display size, browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and various clickstream data.  
						<br>  
						<br>  
						<b>How we use the information  
						</b>
						<ul>  
							<li>We may use personal information and environment information to provide the services you've requested, including services that display customized content and advertising.  
							</li>  
							<li>We may share anonymous aggregated information with third parties outside of Spiceworks.  
							</li>  
							<li>When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.  
							</li>  
							<li>We may also share information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.  
							</li>  
							<li>We may use log file information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and to operate and improve the Spiceworks technologies and services.  
							</li>  
							<li>Spiceworks processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we may process personal information on a server outside your own country.  
							</li>  
							<li>If our company should ever file for bankruptcy or be a party to a merger or acquisition, we may share the information you provide to us to a third party in connection with such activity.  
							</li>
						</ul>  
						<b>Third-Party Sites  
						</b>  
						<br>Please be aware that other websites that may be accessed through our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of those third-party websites linked to our site.   
						<br>  
						<br>  
						<b>Children's Privacy  
						</b>  
						<br>This Site is not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 15. Any person who provides their information to the Company through the account login page for new customers or any other part of the Site represents to the Company that they are 15 years of age or older.   
						<br>  
						<br>  
						<b>Your choices  
						</b>  
						<br>You can uninstall the Spiceworks Desktop software through the "Add or Remove Programs" Control Panel at any time. When you uninstall the software, the Spiceworks Desktop and all its associated data files (i.e. configuration information about discovered hardware and software applications) will be deleted. Once deleted it cannot be recovered. We offer you choices when we ask for personal information, whenever reasonably possible. You may decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies in your browser, although some if not all of our features or services may not function properly as a result.  
						<br>  
						<br>We make good faith efforts to provide you access to your personal information upon request and to let you correct such data if it is inaccurate and delete it, when reasonably possible.  
						<br>  
						<br>  
						<b>More information  
						</b>  
						<br>Spiceworks adheres to the US Safe Harbor privacy principles. For more information about the Safe Harbor framework or our registration, see the Department of Commerce's web site.  
						<br>  
						<br>  
						<b>Feedback  
						</b>
