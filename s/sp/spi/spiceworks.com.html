				<p>Your copy of the Spiceworks Desktop includes a unique application number. If you install the Spiceworks Desktop, this number and a message indicating whether the installation succeeded or failed, is sent back to Spiceworks. Also, when the Spiceworks Desktop automatically checks to see if a new version is available, the current version number and the unique application number are sent to Spiceworks. The unique application number is required for Spiceworks Desktop to function properly and cannot be disabled.</p>
				
				<p>From time to time, the Spiceworks Desktop does collect anonymous aggregate information about your computing environment. This information is anonymized and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable company or user. We use SSL to transmit this information between the Spiceworks Desktop and Spiceworks.</p>
				
				<p>If you chose to complete the personal information sections of your Spiceworks profile, a project page or a profile page, you should be aware that this information is visible to other users of the service. Personally identifiable information you submit to your Spiceworks profile, project and profile pages, any of our forums or discussion groups are considered publicly available outside the Spiceworks network and can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. You may edit and delete this information at any time, but in some cases this may impact your ability to use the service.  To request removal of your personal information from our community contact us at <a href="mailto:info@spiceworks.com">info@spiceworks.com</a>.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
				
				<h4 id="cookies">Cookies</h4>
				
				<p>Spiceworks uses cookies, alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that are stored on your computer, to make Spiceworks easier to use, to improve our advertising, and to protect you and Spiceworks. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to Spiceworks. We also use them to remember the last application page you visited and advertisements you’ve already seen. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Spiceworks.</p>
				
				<p>We use web beacons, one-pixel images embedded in web pages or emails, for the purpose of measuring and analyzing site usage and activity, and improving the quality of the service. Where we use third party service providers acting on our behalf, they are required to abide by these Privacy policies.</p>
				
				<p>Many of the advertisements you see when using Spiceworks have been placed by third parties.  These third parties may choose to use their own cookies for the purposes of collecting information relating to the viewing of their advertising.  This Privacy Policy is intended to cover the use of cookies implemented by Spiceworks and does not describe third party cookies in detail.</p>
				
				<p>Small pieces of code called web beacons are used in conjunction with cookies to help us manage and monitor our online advertising and wider business arrangements with third parties.  These files will allow us to aggregate anonymous information relating to advertising and website usage.  For example, the type of information collected includes information relating to page views.   These web beacons may be used to recognize third party cookies and inform us and/or third parties of which advertisement or link brought you to our website, allowing us to monitor the efficacy of our business relationships with third parties.</p>
				
				<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically from the browser and store it in log files. This information includes display size, browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and various click-stream data. If your browser has a “private browsing” mode you may be able to block this information from being sent to Spiceworks, but in some cases this may impact your ability to use the service.</p>
				
				<h4 id="how">How We Use The Information</h4>
				
				<p>We use your email address to contact you about administrative notices, application &amp; network alerts, community activity, product updates, offers and promotions, and general news about Spiceworks and our partners. The frequency of these emails varies based on the type of notification. For example application alerts are delivered as they occur while our product newsletter is delivered monthly. You can manage your email preferences with respect to content and delivery or you may unsubscribe from all emails about Spiceworks and our partners.</p>
				
				<p>We may use anonymized aggregate personal or environment information to provide the services you've requested, including services that display customized content and advertising, and compare your environment configuration to those of the broader user community. Such information does not identify you or your company individually.</p>
				
				<p>From time-to-time we may ask individual users to participate in customer testimonials posted on our website. We never post these testimonials without their express permission. Any information provided as part of these testimonials is used solely for the purpose of these testimonials and is not used in any other way.  If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:info@spiceworks.com">info@spiceworks.com</a>.</p>
				
				<p>We may use third party service providers to help us deliver parts of the service. When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use a third party service to manage our email marketing campaigns. This system stores your name, email address and the date on which you registered. The service provider is required to adhere to all terms and conditions of this privacy policy.</p>
				
				<p>We may share anonymous aggregated information with third parties outside of Spiceworks, such as advertisers and market research firms approved by Spiceworks, for their marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we share with advertisers the breakdown of our user community by company size and industry. When we share such information it does not identify you or your company individually.</p>
				
				<p>We may also share information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.</p>
				
				<p>We may use browser usage information, which does not identify individual users or companies, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and to operate and improve the Spiceworks technologies and services.</p>
				
				<p>Spiceworks processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we may process personal information on a server outside your own country.</p>
		
				<p>If our company should ever file for bankruptcy or be a party to a merger or acquisition, we may share the information you provide to us to a third party in connection with such activity.</p>
				
				<p>We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on our site.  They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our site and your interaction with our products and services.  These third parties may also use information about your visits to our site and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services.  This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites.  No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process.  They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address or any personally identifying information about the user.</p>
				
				<p>We also work with a third party to monitor certain pages of our website for the purpose of reporting website traffic and other advertising statistics.  Where authorized by us, this third party may use cookies and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our website visitors.  No personally identifiable information is transferred to this third party.</p>

If your personally identifiable information changes, you may update it using the "Update Profile" link at the bottom of the email newsletter. You have control over your Spiceworks user profile and related privacy settings and can edit such to remove information that you do not want others to see publicly.
