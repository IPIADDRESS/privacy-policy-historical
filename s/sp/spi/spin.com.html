below are applicable to the Authors of this site which include Vibe/Spin Ventures, LLC. <br><br>We respect your privacy. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security and is only used in the ways that are described in this policy. <br><br>We collect personally identifying information such as your name, age and e-mail address during registration for certain portions of sites in which guests participate in interactive online activities (e.g., surveys, chat rooms, games, or bulletin boards). In addition, information is collected should you choose to purchase an item from an online store hosted on our site. As described below, we may use such information to fulfill prizes, track customer usage of the sites or for promotional and marketing purposes.<br><br><b>Policies for Minors </b><br>The safety of children online is very important to us. We encourage parents to spend time online with their children and to review the sites accessed by their children. <br><br>Children should always ask parents for permission before sending any personal information online. No information should be submitted to or posted at the our site by any Minor (a guest under 18 years of age), without the consent of their parent or guardian. <br><br>Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, we do not provide any personally identifying information of Minors, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever. No personally identifying information collected from Minors is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever. <br><br>All registrants receive e-mail confirming their Registration. In addition, when a Minor registers, his/her parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that Registration and providing instructions on how the parent could delete the Registration if so desired. <br><br>Although Minors are allowed to participate in contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians.<br><br><b>Policies for Adult Guests </b><br>For guests over 18 years of age, we collect personal information in order to provide you with a personalized online experience and to provide our advertisers a way to reach the right audience.

If you wish to stop receiving e-mail from us or to limit the use of your personal information, you can always unsubscribe yourself from e-mail by updating your Registration information or by notifying us.
