        affiliates or affiliated websites.</p>
    <p>As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer,
        subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way,
        including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing
        and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or
        internationally.</p>

    <h2>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h2>
    <p>When you register to become a member of the Site and in the course of using the Site, you may voluntarily submit

        and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your name, e-mail and photo, are displayed to people
        you have specified in your privacy settings. Profile information you submit to the Site, and make public via
        your privacy settings, will also be available to other users via searching our Site, and may be available to
        third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends can find you and the content you create and store
        on the Site. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real
