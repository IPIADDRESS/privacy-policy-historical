</ul>
<p>All Vertical Health websites were founded by doctors and are now  operated by Vertical Health, LLC. Patient privacy has a longstanding  tradition in medicine. In fact, the Hippocratic Oath (which is sworn to  by physicians around the world), is over 2000 years old, and contains  very specific requirements about patient privacy.</p>
<p>Vertical Health LLC ("VH," "we" or "us") provides a variety of online  services and products, including without limitation, subscription,  newsletter, and update services ("Services"), to users and subscribers  via e-mail and on numerous Web sites throughout the World Wide Web,  including the site you are currently on (the "Sites"). The VH network of  Sites includes <a href="http://www.spineuniverse.com" title="www.spineuniverse.com">spineuniverse.com</a>, <a href="http://www.endocrineweb.com" title="www.endocrineweb.com">endocrineweb.com</a>, <a href="http://www.practicalpainmanagement.com" title="www.practicalpainmanagement.com">practicalpainmanagement.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.diabeticlifestyle.com" title="www.diabeticlifestyle.com">diabeticlifestyle.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.verticalhealth.com" title="www.verticalhealth.com">verticalhealth.com</a>.  VH is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal  information, and providing a safe and secure environment for its users  and subscribers.</p>
<p>THE PURPOSE OF THIS VH PRIVACY POLICY (THE "POLICY") IS TO HELP YOU  UNDERSTAND THE KINDS OF INFORMATION WE MAY GATHER ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU  VISIT THE SITES OR USE ANY OF OUR SERVICES, HOW WE MAY USE THAT  INFORMATION, IN WHICH MANNER WE WILL DISCLOSE IT, AND HOW YOU CAN  CORRECT AND/OR UPDATE THE INFORMATION. PLEASE NOTE THAT BY USING THE  SERVICES OR VISITING THE SITES, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS  POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT  USE THE SERVICES OR REFRAIN FROM VISITING THE SITES.</p>
<p>Please note that the Policy applies only to VH's Services and Sites,  but not to other Web sites to which we may link, or to third parties or  advertisers on the Sites. Additionally, your use of the Services and/or  the Sites is governed by all applicable laws, VH's Terms of Service or  Terms of Use, as well as by any other published rules pertaining to  either a particular Site or Service.</p>
<h3>Targeted Advertising</h3>
<p>VH believes that advertising on the Internet is more interesting to  the user when it is relevant. Therefore, through the use of your  non-personally identifiable information and technologies such as cookies  (each described below), we and our business partners may deliver  advertisements that are targeted towards your particular interests and  your behavior on the Internet. This is sometimes called behavioral  advertising.</p>
<p>Advertising may be delivered to you based upon the non-personally  identifiable information you have provided to us (such as your interests  and demographic data) and non-personally identifiable information we  collect ourselves from you (such as the pages you have viewed on the  Sites or articles you have accessed). For instance, if you expressed an  interest in back pain or have been reading articles on the Sites about  back pain, we may serve advertisements specifically to you regarding  this topic. These targeted advertisements may appear on any number of  Sites owned or controlled by VH that you visit, and may also appear on  the Web sites of VH's business partners which are not owned or  controlled by VH. If you do not want to receive such targeted  advertisements, then follow the instructions below in the section titled  "Managing Cookies."</p>
<h3>The Information We Gather</h3>
<p>VH collects two types of information from visitors or users of the  Sites or the Services: "personally identifiable information," such as  your name and e-mail address and "aggregate" or "non-personally  identifiable information", such as information about a user's use of the  Sites (for example, how many users log on to Sites on a daily basis or  view a particular article).</p>
<p>VH collects information from you at several different points on the  Sites or through use of the Services, either through the use of  technology such as cookies (explained below) or by asking you for  specified information. Personally identifiable information is only  collected by VH from you when you voluntarily provide it to us. This may  occur when you voluntarily fill out a form or otherwise send  information to VH. VH may require its subscribers and users to provide  certain personal information if they wish to participate in various  activities on the Sites (e.g., consummating transactions and entering  into contests, drawings, or surveys). Non-personally identifiable  information may be automatically collected from you in connection with  your use of the Sites or Services.</p>
<h3>Message Board and Chats</h3>
<p>Among the many Services which VH offers subscribers on the Sites, we  provide voluntary message boards, chat rooms, and other interactive  forums. Please be aware that VH makes no commitment to monitor these  forums. Furthermore, any information which you may post to a forum,  including your personally identifiable information, will be disclosed  and available to all users of that forum, and is therefore no longer  private. By using the forums, you agree that VH is not responsible for  any information that you disclose or communicate online in such forums,  and any disclosures you make are at your own risk. VH reserves the right  to republish your postings (in whole or part), taken from the forums,  anywhere on the Sites, or elsewhere on the Web in any format or any  other medium, including print and radio, without prior notice or your  express consent.</p>
<h3>How We Use the Information That We Gather</h3>
<p>VH uses the information collected, including personally identifiable  information, for a variety of purposes. For example, we use your  information to better understand your needs and provide you with better  products and services. We may use your information to respond to your  inquiries or requests; communicate with you; update you on products,  services, and benefits; alert you to promotional offers; personalize the  Sites for you; contact you for market research; or provide you with  marketing information, newsletters, or other information we think would  be of particular interest.</p>
<p>VH may also share your personally identifiable information and/or  aggregate information with our affiliates, technical consultants, third  party auditors, and other third parties who create or maintain the  Sites, enhance their functionality, or provide associated services  and/or deal with you in processing your orders and/or delivering  content, samples, products, services, and gifts and prizes.</p>
<p>In addition, VH may share your personally identifiable information  (including, to the extent permitted by law, any demographic information  you provide to us like ZIP code, age, gender, marital status, product  preferences) with third parties, so that such third parties can contact  you regarding their products, services, offers, or information we think  you will find valuable. These third parties may also use the information  to generate aggregate reports and market research or for other  purposes. Any information shared with third parties becomes subject to  such third parties' privacy policies and terms of use. VH is not  responsible for any subsequent usage made by such third parties of the  information they have received from us. If you would rather not have us  share this information with third parties, just notify us at  973-783-7009. Make sure you notify us for each account or e-mail address  you have with us.</p>
<p>VH uses certain technologies, such as "cookies," to personalize and improve your online experience.</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to  your computer's hard drive. Cookies store information about your visit  to the Sites or your use of the Services, thereby allowing you to access  certain VH Site features not otherwise available. The information in  the cookie is transmitted from your computer to VH, our agents, or to  one of our third-party authorized service contractors and business  partners. The information contained in these cookies makes it possible  for us to know if you are presently logged onto a Site or using any of  the Services, or whether you have done so in a prior visit. This  technology also enables VH to instantly determine your access privileges  while allowing you to navigate the Sites or use any of the Services  without having to repeatedly log in.</li>
    <li>Cookies from VH and/or one of our authorized service contractors  or business partners are also used to collect standard information  transmitted from your Web browser including, without limitation: your  Internet protocol address, browser type, Web pages you visited with date  and time, purchases you made on any of the Sites and the type of  operating system on your computer. This information is used to help us  understand and meet the ever-changing needs and interests of our  visitors or subscribers.</li>
    <li>VH may also use cookies to track your access to, and use of the  forums on the Sites, as well as your responses to any of our online  surveys.</li>
    <li>VH does not control any cookies you may receive from an  advertiser or other third party and these cookies are not subject to  this Policy, although the advertiser may have their own policy.</li>
    <li>VH also uses Web beacon technology to help track site usage. Web  beacons (also called single pixel gifs or action tags) allow VH to  track page viewing counts and pattern, which we use to focus and tailor  future content development, measure the effectiveness of VH's own  marketing campaigns, and assist with broadband capacity management for  the Sites.</li>
    <li>VH also employs Web beacons within the context of certain  e-mails in order to determine the effectiveness and appeal of those  mailings. These Web beacons "sense" and notify VH if and when you open  the e-mail, if your e-mail program is capable of displaying HTML  messages, and where you may navigate within these HTML messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>VH may also use a third party ad network provider to help present  advertisements on this Site. Third-party ad serving enables VH to target  advertisements to you for products and services you might be interested  in. These third party network advertisers, along with other advertisers  and sponsors on the Sites, may use cookies, Web beacons, or similar  technologies (and, in the case of cookies, access them on your computer  if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser) to serve you  advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this  and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a  particular advertisement before, and to avoid sending you duplicated  advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects non-personally  identifiable information such as your browser type, your operating  system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed,  and other clickstream data. The use of third party cookies, Web beacons,  and similar technologies by these ad network providers is governed by  each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. Please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out" procedures of third party ad networks we may use.</p>
<p>Please note that VH reserves the right to access and/or disclose  personally identifiable information and aggregate information we gather,  as required by courts or administrative agencies and to the extent  required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment, or  other violations of any law, rule, or regulation, the Sites' rules or  policies, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected  conduct that VH deems improper.</p>
<h3>Managing Cookies</h3>
<p>You always have the option of setting your browser to warn you when a  cookie is being accessed on your computer, to delete cookies that are  currently on your computer or to decline cookies altogether. However, to  take full advantage of the Sites, Services, and features offered by VH,  your browser must accept cookies. The settings on your computer that  allow you to accept or refuse cookies vary depending on the Web browser  you are running. Please check the help tab of your browser for specifics  on your software.</p>
<h3>Children's Information</h3>
<p>VH's policy is that it does not knowingly collect personally  identifiable information from individuals under thirteen years of age.  The Services or Sites are not directed or intended for children under  thirteen years of age. If you are under thirteen years of age, you  should not register to become a Subscriber or provide personally  identifiable information on any of the Sites. If you are the parent or  guardian of a child whom you believe has disclosed personally  identifiable information to VH, please contact VH at <a href="mailto:customer.service@spineuniverse.com">customer.service@spineuniverse.com</a> so that we may delete and remove such child's information from our systems.</p>
<h3>Disclosure of Personal Information in the Event of Merger or Sale of Assets</h3>
<p>VH, its parent, subsidiaries, or affiliates, could merge with or be  acquired by another business entity, or all or substantially all of  their respective assets could be acquired, or the assets of this Site  could be acquired or transferred to another business entity. Should such  a combination, acquisition, transaction, or transfer occur, VH reserves  the right to transfer some or all of your personally identifiable  information and other information to our successors in business and  purchasers (in whole or in part) of this Site's assets.</p>
<p>Certain information or Services offered or provided through the Sites  may, from time to time, be provided on or through other Web sites  operated by or in conjunction with third parties ("Partners"). These Web  sites and the features thereon may have the same "look and feel" as  VH's Sites and/or Services. VH terms these Web sites "co-branded sites",  and often times a Partner's logo or name may appear on the Web site, or  the Partner's name may appear in the URL. Although VH will retain any  personally identifiable information collected about you from one of  these co-branded sites, such information may also be shared by VH with  that Partner. A Partner's use of any information shared will be subject  to the Partner's own privacy practices and policies.</p>
<h3>Third Party Links</h3>
<p>VH does not monitor, control, or endorse the information collection  or privacy practices of any third parties including, without limitation,  any Partner, advertiser, or other third party who may provide services  throughout the Sites. On behalf of various sponsors, the Sites may  provide sponsored links to third party Web sites or resources ("Linked  Sites"). VH neither controls nor have we reviewed or approved the  content that appears on such Linked Sites.</p>
<p>Even though certain information collected by such third parties might  not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become  familiar with their privacy practices, and to contact them if you have  any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that VH is not responsible for the  legality, accuracy, or inappropriate nature of any content, advertising,  products, or other materials on or available from such Linked Sites.  You further acknowledge and agree that VH shall not be responsible or  liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged  to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such  content, goods, and services available on or through any such Linked  Site.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>VH places a priority on the security of personally identifiable  information, and we undertake reasonable security measures to protect  the data that resides on our servers. VH also uses secure server  software (SSL) to process all transactions that occur on the Sites. SSL  encrypts all of your personal information transmitted over the Internet,  including your credit card number, name, and address. However, no  security system is impenetrable. VH cannot warrant or guaranty the  security of its servers, nor can it guaranty that information supplied  by Subscribers or other users will not be intercepted while being  transmitted over the Internet.</p>
<h3>Correction/Updating Personal Information - Opt-Out</h3>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your  address or ZIP code), or if you no longer desire to use or access one of  the Sites or Services, VH encourages you to correct, update, or remove  the personal information that you provided. This can be done at the  "Manage My Account" page on each of the Sites. Keep in mind, however,  that even if you delete your account from VH's records, there will be  residual information that will remain within VH's databases, access  logs, and other records, which may or may not contain personally  identifiable information. VH is not responsible for updating or removing  any information contained in third party lists or databases.</p>
<h3>How To Contact Us</h3>
<p>Please relay any questions you may have pertaining to our above stated policies to our Customer Service Department at <a href="mailto:customer.service@spineuniverse.com">customer.service@spineuniverse.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>If VH makes changes to any of the terms or conditions of the Policy,  this document will be revised so that you will always know what  information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we  will disclose it. We reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove  portions of this Policy at any time and without notice, and any changes  will become effective immediately upon being posted unless VH advises  you otherwise. Your continued use of the Services and/or the Sites after  this Policy has been amended shall be deemed to be your continued  acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Policy, as amended. We  encourage you to bookmark this Web page and review this Policy  regularly.</p>
