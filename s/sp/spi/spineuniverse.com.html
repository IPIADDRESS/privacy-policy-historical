        <div class="visualIEFloatFix"><p>SpineUniverse was founded by  doctors. Patient privacy has a longstanding tradition in medicine. In fact, the  Hippocratic Oath (which is sworn to by physicians around the world), is over  2000 years old, and contains very specific requirements about patient privacy. </p>
<p>SpineUniverse LLC ("SPU," "we" or "us")  provides a variety of online services and products, including without  limitation, subscription, newsletter, and update services  ("Services"), to users and subscribers via e-mail and on numerous Web  sites throughout the World Wide Web, including the site you are currently on  (the "Sites"). The SPU network of Sites includes <a href="http://www.spineuniverse.com">www.spineuniverse.com</a>, <a href="http://www.endocrineweb.com">www.endocrineweb.com</a>, and  www.verticalhealth.com. SPU is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of  your personal information, and providing a safe and secure environment for its  users and subscribers.</p>
<p>THE PURPOSE OF THIS SPU PRIVACY POLICY (THE "POLICY") IS TO HELP  YOU UNDERSTAND THE KINDS OF INFORMATION WE MAY GATHER ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU VISIT  THE SITES OR USE ANY OF OUR SERVICES, HOW WE MAY USE THAT INFORMATION, IN WHICH  MANNER WE WILL DISCLOSE IT, AND HOW YOU CAN CORRECT AND/OR UPDATE THE INFORMATION.  PLEASE NOTE THAT BY USING THE SERVICES OR VISITING THE SITES, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR  AGREEMENT WITH THIS POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY,  PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES OR REFRAIN FROM VISITING THE SITES. </p>
<p>Please note that the Policy applies only to SPU's Services and Sites, but  not to other Web sites to which we may link, or to third parties or advertisers  on the Sites. Additionally, your use of the Services and/or the Sites is  governed by all applicable laws, SPU's Terms of Service or Terms of Use, as  well as by any other published rules pertaining to either a particular Site or  Service. </p>
<h3>Targeted Advertising</h3>
<p>SPU believes that advertising on the Internet is more interesting to the  user when it is relevant. Therefore, through the use of your non-personally  identifiable information and technologies such as cookies (each described  below), we and our business partners may deliver advertisements that are  targeted towards your particular interests and your behavior on the Internet. This  is sometimes called behavioral advertising. </p>
<p>Advertising may be delivered to you based upon the non-personally  identifiable information you have provided to us (such as your interests and  demographic data) and non-personally identifiable information we collect  ourselves from you (such as the pages you have viewed on the Sites or articles  you have accessed). For instance, if you expressed an interest in back pain or  have been reading articles on the Sites about back pain, we may serve  advertisements specifically to you regarding this topic. These targeted  advertisements may appear on any number of Sites owned or controlled by SPU  that you visit, and may also appear on the Web sites of SPU's business partners  which are not owned or controlled by SPU. If you do not want to receive such targeted advertisements, then follow the  instructions below in the section titled "Managing Cookies." </p>
<h3>The Information We Gather</h3>
<p>SPU collects two types of information from visitors or users of the Sites or  the Services: "personally identifiable information," such as your  name and e-mail address and "aggregate" or "non-personally  identifiable information", such as information about a user's use of the  Sites (for example, how many users log on to Sites on a daily basis or view a  particular article). </p>
<p>SPU collects information from you at several different points on the Sites  or through use of the Services, either through the use of technology such as  cookies (explained below) or by asking you for specified information.  Personally identifiable information is only collected by SPU from you when you  voluntarily provide it to us. This may occur when you voluntarily fill out a  form or otherwise send information to SPU. SPU may require its subscribers and  users to provide certain personal information if they wish to participate in  various activities on the Sites (e.g., consummating transactions and entering  into contests, drawings, or surveys). Non-personally identifiable information  may be automatically collected from you in connection with your use of the  Sites or Services.</p>
<h3>Message Board and Chats</h3>
<p>Among the many Services which SPU offers subscribers on the Sites, we  provide voluntary message boards, chat rooms, and other interactive forums.  Please be aware that SPU makes no commitment to monitor these forums.  Furthermore, any information which you may post to a forum, including your  personally identifiable information, will be disclosed and available to all  users of that forum, and is therefore no longer private. By using the forums,  you agree that SPU is not responsible for any information that you disclose or  communicate online in such forums, and any disclosures you make are at your own  risk. SPU reserves the right to republish your postings (in whole or part),  taken from the forums, anywhere on the Sites, or elsewhere on the Web in any  format or any other medium, including print and radio, without prior notice or  your express consent. </p>
<h3>How We Use the Information That We Gather</h3>
<p>SPU uses the information collected, including personally identifiable  information, for a variety of purposes. For example, we use your information to  better understand your needs and provide you with better products and services.  We may use your information to respond to your inquiries or requests;  communicate with you; update you on products, services, and benefits; alert you  to promotional offers; personalize the Sites for you; contact you for market  research; or provide you with marketing information, newsletters, or other  information we think would be of particular interest. </p>
<p>SPU may also share your personally identifiable information and/or aggregate  information with our affiliates, technical consultants, third party auditors,  and other third parties who create or maintain the Sites, enhance their  functionality, or provide associated services and/or deal with you in  processing your orders and/or delivering content, samples, products, services,  and gifts and prizes. </p>
<p>In addition, SPU may share your personally identifiable information  (including, to the extent permitted by law, any demographic information you  provide to us like ZIP code, age, gender, marital status, product preferences)  with third parties, so that such third parties can contact you regarding their  products, services, offers, or information we think you will find valuable.  These third parties may also use the information to generate aggregate reports  and market research or for other purposes. Any information shared with third  parties becomes subject to such third parties' privacy policies and terms of use.  SPU is not responsible for any subsequent usage made by such third parties of  the information they have received from us. If you would rather not have us  share this information with third parties, just notify us at 973-783-7009. Make  sure you notify us for each account or e-mail address you have with us. </p>
<p>SPU uses certain technologies, such as "cookies," to personalize  and improve your online experience. </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Cookies       are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard       drive. Cookies store information about your visit to the Sites or your use       of the Services, thereby allowing you to access certain SPU Site features       not otherwise available. The information in the cookie is transmitted from       your computer to SPU, our agents, or to one of our third-party authorized       service contractors and business partners. The information contained in       these cookies makes it possible for us to know if you are presently logged       onto a Site or using any of the Services, or whether you have done so in a       prior visit. This technology also enables SPU to instantly determine your       access privileges while allowing you to navigate the Sites or use any of       the Services without having to repeatedly log in. </li>
  <li>Cookies       from SPU and/or one of our authorized service contractors or business       partners are also used to collect standard information transmitted from       your Web browser including, without limitation: your Internet protocol       address, browser type, Web pages you visited with date and time, purchases       you made on any of the Sites and the type of operating system on your       computer. This information is used to help us understand and meet the       ever-changing needs and interests of our visitors or subscribers. </li>
  <li>SPU may       also use cookies to track your access to, and use of the forums on the       Sites, as well as your responses to any of our online surveys. </li>
  <li>SPU does       not control any cookies you may receive from an advertiser or other third       party and these cookies are not subject to this Policy, although the       advertiser may have their own policy. </li>
  <li>SPU also       uses Web beacon technology to help track site usage. Web beacons (also       called single pixel gifs or action tags) allow SPU to track page viewing       counts and pattern, which we use to focus and tailor future content       development, measure the effectiveness of SPU's own marketing campaigns,       and assist with broadband capacity management for the Sites. </li>
  <li>SPU also       employs Web beacons within the context of certain e-mails in order to       determine the effectiveness and appeal of those mailings. These Web       beacons "sense" and notify SPU if and when you open the e-mail,       if your e-mail program is capable of displaying HTML messages, and where       you may navigate within these HTML messages. </li>
</ul>
<p>SPU may also use a third party ad network provider to help present  advertisements on this Site. Third-party ad serving enables SPU to target  advertisements to you for products and services you might be interested in.  These third party network advertisers, along with other advertisers and  sponsors on the Sites, may use cookies, Web beacons, or similar technologies  (and, in the case of cookies, access them on your computer if you choose to  have cookies enabled in your browser) to serve you advertisements tailored to  interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited,  to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, and to  avoid sending you duplicated advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects  non-personally identifiable information such as your browser type, your  operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads  viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of third party cookies, Web  beacons, and similar technologies by these ad network providers is governed by  each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. Please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> to learn more about the information collection practices and  "opt-out" procedures of third party ad networks we may use. </p>
<p>Please note that SPU reserves the right to access and/or disclose personally  identifiable information and aggregate information we gather, as required by  courts or administrative agencies and to the extent required to permit us to  investigate suspected fraud, harassment, or other violations of any law, rule,  or regulation, the Sites' rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or  to investigate any suspected conduct that SPU deems improper. </p>
<h3>Managing Cookies</h3>
<p>You always have the option of setting your browser to warn you when a cookie  is being accessed on your computer, to delete cookies that are currently on  your computer or to decline cookies altogether. However, to take full advantage  of the Sites, Services, and features offered by SPU, your browser must accept  cookies. The settings on your computer that allow you to accept or refuse  cookies vary depending on the Web browser you are running. Please check the  help tab of your browser for specifics on your software. </p>
<h3>Children's Information</h3>
<p>SPU's policy is that it does not knowingly collect personally identifiable  information from individuals under thirteen years of age. The Services or Sites  are not directed or intended for children under thirteen years of age. If you  are under thirteen years of age, you should not register to become a Subscriber  or provide personally identifiable information on any of the Sites. If you are  the parent or guardian of a child whom you believe has disclosed personally  identifiable information to SPU, please contact SPU at <a href="mailto:privacy@waterfrontmedia.com">customer.service@spineuniverse.com</a> so that we may delete and remove such child's information from our systems. </p>
<h3>Disclosure of Personal Information in the Event of Merger or Sale of Assets</h3>
<p>SPU, its parent, subsidiaries, or affiliates, could merge with or be  acquired by another business entity, or all or substantially all of their  respective assets could be acquired, or the assets of this Site could be  acquired or transferred to another business entity. Should such a combination,  acquisition, transaction, or transfer occur, SPU reserves the right to transfer  some or all of your personally identifiable information and other information  to our successors in business and purchasers (in whole or in part) of this  Site's assets. </p>
<p>Certain information or Services offered or provided through the Sites may,  from time to time, be provided on or through other Web sites operated by or in  conjunction with third parties ("Partners"). These Web sites and the  features thereon may have the same "look and feel" as SPU's Sites  and/or Services. SPU terms these Web sites "co-branded sites", and  often times a Partner's logo or name may appear on the Web site, or the  Partner's name may appear in the URL. Although SPU will retain any personally  identifiable information collected about you from one of these co-branded  sites, such information may also be shared by SPU with that Partner. A  Partner's use of any information shared will be subject to the Partner's own  privacy practices and policies.</p>
<h3>Third Party Links</h3>
<p>SPU does not monitor, control, or endorse the information collection or  privacy practices of any third parties including, without limitation, any  Partner, advertiser, or other third party who may provide services throughout  the Sites. On behalf of various sponsors, the Sites may provide sponsored links  to third party Web sites or resources ("Linked Sites"). SPU neither  controls nor have we reviewed or approved the content that appears on such  Linked Sites.</p>
<p>Even though certain information collected by such third parties might not  identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with  their privacy practices, and to contact them if you have any questions about  their respective privacy policies and practices. </p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that SPU is not responsible for the legality,  accuracy, or inappropriate nature of any content, advertising, products, or  other materials on or available from such Linked Sites. You further acknowledge  and agree that SPU shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly,  for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with  use of or reliance on any such content, goods, and services available on or  through any such Linked Site. </p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>SPU places a priority on the security of personally identifiable  information, and we undertake reasonable security measures to protect the data  that resides on our servers. SPU also uses secure server software (SSL) to  process all transactions that occur on the Sites. SSL encrypts all of your  personal information transmitted over the Internet, including your credit card  number, name, and address. However, no security system is impenetrable. SPU  cannot warrant or guaranty the security of its servers, nor can it guaranty  that information supplied by Subscribers or other users will not be intercepted  while being transmitted over the Internet. </p>
<h3>Correction/Updating Personal Information - Opt-Out</h3>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your address or  ZIP code), or if you no longer desire to use or access one of the Sites or  Services, SPU encourages you to correct, update, or remove the personal  information that you provided. This can be done at the "Manage My  Account" page on each of the Sites. Keep in mind, however, that even if  you delete your account from SPU's records, there will be residual information  that will remain within SPU's databases, access logs, and other records, which  may or may not contain personally identifiable information. SPU is not  responsible for updating or removing any information contained in third party  lists or databases. </p>
<h3>How To Contact Us</h3>
<p>Please relay any questions you may have pertaining to our above stated  policies to our Customer Service Department at customer.service@spineuniverse.com</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>If SPU makes changes to any of the terms or conditions of the Policy, this  document will be revised so that you will always know what information we  gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it. We  reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Policy at  any time and without notice, and any changes will become effective immediately  upon being posted unless SPU advises you otherwise. Your continued use of the Services  and/or the Sites after this Policy has been amended shall be deemed to be your  continued acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Policy, as amended. We  encourage you to bookmark this Web page and review this Policy regularly. </p>
