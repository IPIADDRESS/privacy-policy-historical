Access data</b></p><p class="clr">You can visit our websites without providing any personal information.</p><p class="clr">Whenever users call individual pages, or log in or out, spinchat.com stores the current IP address, the name of the application used for access, as well as name and status of the requested file assigned to the pseudonym chosen by the user.

If one of the dialog participants reports an abuse via the function provided for this purpose in the dialog window, the last 30 minutes of this dialog are stored forgery-proof from the chat serverâs volatile main memory into the database as an abuse report.</p><p class="clr">Users also have the possibility to report abuse in other services in spinchat.com (e.g. dialogs/messages/profiles). Abuse reports are viewed by spinchat.com employees, checked and - if appropriate - forwarded to investigative authorities.</p><p class="clr">If the user buys optional offers (e.g. VIP or spin points), the corresponding payment data will be stored as long as necessary for processing the payment process; in the case of standing orders, until the user stops the standing order or deletes his registered account.</p><p class="clr"><b>4.

Messages sent to other users, such as dialogs, e-mails, guestbook entries or gifts, are retained by these users. Public contributions in which the user has inadvertently disclosed sensitive/personal data can, however, be subsequently removed by contacting our customer service stating the URL to be removed exactly.</p><p class="clr">The data of users who are banned and blocked by SPiN AG will be retained within a 30-day period during which such a block can still be reversed if it is based on an error. After expiry of this period, the user's profile details and photos will be automatically deleted as after a self-initiated deletion; however, we reserve the right, in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR, to protect our legitimate interests, which predominate in the context of a weighing of interests, to store data which are necessary to maintain the block itself, such as the pseudonym, email address and telephone number used for registration beyond this period, whereby this data will under no circumstances be used in any other way than to maintain the ban.</p><p class="clr"><b>5. Transmission of data</b></p><p class="clr">Depending on which payment service provider you select in the order process, we pass on the payment data collected for the processing of payments to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to payment service providers commissioned by us or to the selected payment service. In some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves if you create an account there.
