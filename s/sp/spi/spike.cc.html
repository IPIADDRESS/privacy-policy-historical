<h4>1. Transaction Information. </h4>

<p>When you use our Services to make or accept payments, we collect information about when the transactions occurred, a description of the transactions, the payment amounts, billing and shipping information and any other applicable information for payments. We will share a part of the information such as buyers’ addresses, names and phone numbers for shipping purposes and email addresses for communication only with the seller of the items in order to do transactions.</p>

<p>When you submit a ticket or email to our customer support, we collect and save the history of communication with you as well as any personal data submitted by you in the course of the communication (for example the email address), in order to answer your inquiry as best we can. We do not share this information with third parties.</p>

<h4>5. Other, voluntarily submitted information about you</h4>

<p>We always strive to improve our offerings and services as well as to adapt them to our users. Therefore, you can submit additional personal data to us as part of the use of our Services or in the course of direct communication with us, such as name, address, age, gender, interests and your feedback on Services, You can also allow us to collect and record your usage behavior on partner websites.</p>

<h3>Using Information We Collect</h3>

<p>To provide you with the best possible customer experience, your personal data is collected, used and/or disclosed, always in accordance with the applicable data protection laws, for the following purposes:</p>

<h4>1. Usage data</h4>

<p>1.1 Optimization of the Services. We collect, process, and store your personal data, insofar as we see legitimate legal or business purposes for it. In other words, we collect, process, and store your data to better understand your websites and services and thus offer you better services. We can, for instance, not only use the personal data collected for providing you with Services (i.e. use of services, use of customer support), but we can also use it to identify malfunctions and/or misuse of our websites and Services, and to deliver content that aligns with your interest. </p>

<p>1.2 Prevention and combat of abuse. We collect and store your personal data on the use of our websites and Services, such as activity on your website. These include the monitoring of behavior patterns and checking for manipulations that can be useful in detecting misuse or improper activity by you.

If we determine that you violate your contractual obligations, for instance by using illicit scripts, we explicitly reserve the right to bring your data together with other data collected by us to prove the violation. We will then possibly take additional measures against you concerned to restore normal operation.</p>

<p>We will protect your personal data in our possession or under our control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorized access, use or disclosure to ensure that you will have a safe online experience. We have in place certain physical, electronic, contractual, and managerial safeguards to protect the security and privacy of your personal data.</p>

<p>When you enter your personal data on our websites, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your information as it is transmitted to us. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should generally change from "http" to "https."</p>

<p>If METAPS learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Services or providing personal information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. METAPS may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the website. METAPS may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at <b>customer_support<script type="text/javascript">document.write('&#64;');</script>@<noscript>@</noscript>spike.cc</b>.</p>

<p>Identity thieves sometimes send fraudulent email messages to trick users into divulging personal or financial data (a practice known as "phishing"). "Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal data. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal data, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal data through email. If you have received or entered personal data in response to a suspicious email, pop-up or phony website claiming to be affiliated with us, please email us from our inquiry page immediately.</p>

<h4>1. Our Use of Cookies</h4>

<p>We regularly use browser cookies for tracking. </p>
