      <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
      <p>This privacy policy clarifies that how Livepcupdate gathers, uses and reveals personal and other info. Livepcupdate collects in connection with the customer support services we provide to customer (the “Services”) in accordance with the Terms of Use (http://www.Livepcupdate.com/privacypolicy). When you submit information through our website, email, chat session, provide it to our technicians or, use the Services, you (the “customer”) agree to our use of this information consistent with this privacy policy.</p>
      <h3>HOW MICROPCEXPERT  COLLECTS INFORMATION-</h3>
      <p>We provide user support services to consumers using web-based tools and software as well as through telephone support of our users. These tools may include software that enables us to remotely access and control a user’s computer with their permission. We require certain information and permissions from you to provide the Services.
Some information we collect may be provided by the user directly such as when requested by a form or on the phone by a technician. Other technical information might be collected or accessed by or through our diagnostic and related tools as our computers work with yours to provide the Services.</p>
<h3>TYPES OF INFORMATION MICROPCEXPERT  COLLECTS</h3>
<p>Information You Provide</p>
<h3>1. PERSONAL INFORMATION:</h3>
<p>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (“personal information”) or allows us to contact you. In order to use the Services, the user must first typically register or provide certain identifying information. For online registration, we ask you to provide contact details (such as First and Last name, E-mail address, Postal address, Personal identifier etc.). Livepcupdate uses this information to contact you regarding the product and/or services you have requested.

<h3>REMOTE ACCESS:</h3>
<p>While requesting support you may request for the problem to be resolved by enabling Livepcupdate technicians to have access to and take control of your computer. Livepcupdate uses software tools which enable you to grant control of your computer to a Livepcupdate technician remotely over the Internet. This allows the Livepcupdate technician to diagnose or correct problems without ever coming to the location of your computer.</p>
<p>Livepcupdate does not use the Remote Access software to access and control your computer without your consent and we request that you remain present when our technicians are doing so.</p>
<p>Livepcupdate technicians are trained in the use of this software and we take steps to limit access to confidential or sensitive information stored on user computer or network, avoid deliberate destruction of information on user
computers or networks, and help avoid system problems. Livepcupdate maintains specific internal policy and technical controls to limit how and whether our remote access tools may be used to assist you.</p>
<h3>DIAGNOSTIC TOOL:</h3>
<p>Livepcupdate uses some online diagnostic tools that may collect a wide variety of useful information about the state of a computer system and your applications.

The Livepcupdate diagnostic application is not designed to collect sensitive information including information such websites visited, e-mail messages, e-mail addresses sent to, passwords, profiles etc.</p>
<p>Use of the Remote Access and Diagnostic applications may be subject to the terms and conditions of the respective software license agreements.</p>
<h3>LIVE HELP SESSION RECORDS:</h3>
<p>Livepcupdate reserves the right to monitor and record on-line and off-line sessions between users and Livepcupdate  technicians for quality control and service-related purposes.

I would happily recommend your services to any business in need of a competent, very knowledgeable computer service.<br>

Excellent! Being somewhat techy myself I purchased a new wireless router. But just could not get it hooked up right - even though I knew I should be able to do so. Finally gave in and called Craig. No offense to Craig but I was a bit glad when he had difficulties too! But he continued on and finally was able to figure out the problem. Got me all set up!

I called  to get help with my computer and found out that i had technical support for an year that i paid for in february 2012. My technical support gentleman was Robin Brown who worked on both of my computers for 2 days and showed this older lady who is not computer savvy alot of things. I hope that any one else that calls in gets him for a support tech as he is the best one i ever had. <br>
