                            	<p>At Conscious Dating Network, which owns and operates Spiritual Singles, we highly value your privacy and it is and has always been a top priority for us. We have designed and built our websites with a focus on your privacy so that you can focus on building conscious connections and meaningful relationships.</p>
				<p>We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information and we do not take this lightly.</p>
                            	<p><b>We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data.</b> Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we have written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!</p>
                            	<p><b>We work hard to keep your information secure.</b> We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.</p>
                            	<p>Conscious Dating Network consists of several spiritual and green online dating sites all sharing one database of members, like different doorways into the same house. In other words, we have different domains (doorways), some of which are marketed directly by us and others that are marketed by third parties. All members are saved in one database and all members have access to all members from all domains automatically. Members only need to join one site to have access to all. We do this for marketing purposes so as to provide our members with more possibilities to meet and ultimately create conscious connections and relationships.</p>

                            	<p>We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information.

                               Since our goal is to help you make conscious connections, and relationships, the main sharing of members' information is, of course, with other members.

Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you're comfortable being publically viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it. We ask that you do not post any contact info (on your profile) that could allow others to contact you directly (such as email address, phone number, social media info, business name, your real name...etc..)

Your member "card" with your basic info (not your full profile) may be visible to some members, for example, if another member searches for you by username, or if you have email messages with members and one of these members clicks on your profile link from their Inbox. In these instances, the member will see your member card with a note that you have hidden your profile.
