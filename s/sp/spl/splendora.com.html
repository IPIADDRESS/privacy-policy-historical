<strong>Splendora, Inc. Web Site Privacy Policy
<br>(Last Updated:&nbsp; July 1,&nbsp; 2005)</strong>
</p>
<p class="privacy">Splendora, Inc. ("
<strong>Splendora</strong>") has created this privacy policy (the
“
<strong>Policy</strong>”) to explain our privacy practices so
you will understand when and how personal information is collected,
used, disclosed and protected with respect to our web site located
at 
<a href="http://www.splendora.com/">http://www.splendora.com</a>
(the "
<strong>Site</strong>").&nbsp; By using the Site, you consent to
the privacy practices described in this Policy.&nbsp; 
<a name="top"></a>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any
time.&nbsp; If we make any material changes to our Policy, we will
post a new policy on our Site and update the "last updated" date
set forth above.&nbsp; Therefore, we encourage you to check our
Policy whenever you use the Site to see if it has been updated
since your last visit.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" class="privacy">
<a name="information"><strong>INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</strong></a>
</p>
<p class="privacy">We collect two basic types of information with
our Site, namely personal information and aggregate
information.&nbsp; Personal information is information that is
directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a
user's name, e-mail address, financial information, or information
about activities that is directly linked to that person.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="privacy">Our definition of personal information does not
include “aggregate” information.&nbsp; Aggregate
information is data we collect about a group or category of
services or users from which individual user identities have been
removed.&nbsp; This may include demographic information (such as
age, gender, race, occupation, household income, and job title) and
profile data.&nbsp; In other words, information on how you use our
Site may be collected and combined with information about how
others use the Site, but no personal information will be included
in the resulting data.&nbsp; Aggregate data helps us understand
trends in our users' needs so that we can better consider new
features or otherwise tailor our Site.&nbsp; We may share aggregate
information about our users with third parties for various
purposes, including to help us better understand and improve our
Site, and for advertising and marketing purposes.&nbsp; This
information will be shared with our partners only anonymously and
in aggregate.</p>
<p class="privacy">
<a name="types"></a>Those are the types of personal and other
information we collect.&nbsp; You should refer to the rest of this
Policy to see how we use, disclose and protect this
information:</p>
<p class="privacy">
<strong>Information You Give Us.</strong>
</p>
<p class="privacy">We collect information you give us at various
times when you register with us and use our Site.&nbsp; Examples
include the following:</p>
<ul class="privacy">
<li>
<strong>Registration and Transaction Information.&nbsp;</strong>
When you register to use the Site, we may collect various kinds of
contact information about you including, for example, your name,
address, telephone number, e-mail address, birth date, and zip
code.&nbsp; In addition, we may collect images, pictures, data
files, and written descriptions or statements about you.&nbsp; Our
site also uses an order form for customers to request information,
products, and services. When a visitor uses the order form, we may
collect the visitor's contact information (such as their name and
e-mail address), financial information (such as their account or
credit card numbers), health-related information, and other
information (such as their age and site preferences).&nbsp;
&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Submissions and Member Service.</strong>&nbsp; From
time-to-time we may post surveys or contests on our Site.&nbsp; Our
online surveys ask visitors for contact information (such as their
name and e-mail address) and other information (such as their zip
code, age, or income level). The customer's contact information
will not be shared with our partners, but we will, from time to
time, send offers from our partners to those visitors who have not
opted out.&nbsp; We use contact data from our contests to send
users information about our company and promotional material from
some of our partners.&nbsp; Users may opt-out of receiving future
mailings by following the instructions below in the section
entitled “Access and Control of Personal
Information.”&nbsp; Participation in these requests is
completely voluntary and with each request you will have the choice
of whether or not to participate and disclose information.&nbsp;
Additionally, we provide message boards and other interactive
services, and retain the information and content submitted by users
utilizing these services.&nbsp; Also, we may collect information
that identifies you personally when you send us comments, questions
or suggestions, or if you send to us job applications, resumes, or
other business-related contacts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="privacy">
<strong>Automatically Collected Information.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="privacy">We automatically receive certain types of
information whenever you interact with us.&nbsp; For example, when
you use the Site, our systems automatically collect your IP address
and the type of operating system or browser you use.&nbsp; We may
also collect information regarding your geographic location when
accessing our Site.</p>
<p class="privacy">We may also collect standard access information,
such as the time and date of accessing the Site, and usage of the
Site.&nbsp; We use such information to help manage the
effectiveness of our online advertising and to gather access
information, such as counting the users who have visited those
pages and compiling aggregated statistics about Site usage.&nbsp;
Automatically collected information does not contain any personal
information and we do not link such automatically collected
information to personal information about you.</p>
<ul class="privacy">
<li>
<strong>Cookies.&nbsp;</strong> We may use cookies to collect
information so that we can improve our Site by seeing which areas
and features are most popular; to personalize the Site and improve
the Site experience; and to allow you to visit the Site without
re-entering your member ID and/or password.&nbsp; Most browsers
automatically accept cookies as the default setting.&nbsp; You can
modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before
accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser
options.&nbsp; If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will
still be able to access those parts of our Site available to the
general public, but you may not be able to use some of the
Site’s features or services, and you may have a less
satisfactory experience.</li>
<li>
<strong>Web Beacons.&nbsp;</strong> “Web beacons” (also
known as Internet tags, pixel tags, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs,
invisible GIFs, 1-by-1 GIFs, and web bugs) are tiny graphic files
placed on a Web page which send a signal when a user has visited
that page, allowing the site to collect standard access
information, such as time and date of a page view, and a
description of the page on which the web beacon resides.&nbsp; We
use web beacons to help manage the effectiveness of our online
advertising and to gather access information, such as counting the
users who have visited those pages and compiling aggregated
statistics about site usage; our web beacons do not contain any
personal information and we do not link web beacons to personal
information about you.&nbsp; We may send you e-mail with web
beacons for purposes of tracking the e-mail message.&nbsp; However,
you may opt-out of receiving future e-mail by following the
instructions below in the section entitled “Access and
Control of Personal Information.”&nbsp; Also, our site may
allow third parties such as advertisers to use web beacons on the
Site.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="privacy">
<a name="children"><strong>No Information about Children</strong></a>
<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p class="privacy">Our Site is not intended to be used by children
under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly, directly or
passively, collect information from children under the age of
13.&nbsp; If we create offers and products that make it appropriate
to collect information from children under the age of 13, we will
notify you of the change in this Policy.</p>
<p align="center" class="privacy">
<a name="use"><strong>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></a>
</p>
<p class="privacy">
<a name="internal"><strong>Internal Use of Personal Information</strong></a>
<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p class="privacy">In general, we use personal information
internally to perform marketing analysis, and to serve our users
and enable them to take maximum advantage of our Site. &nbsp;For
example, contact information from the order form is used to provide
services or complete transactions you have requested, to anticipate
and resolve problems with our Site, to respond to customer support
inquiries, to provide you with information about our company, and
to create and inform you of new products and services from
Splendora that better meet your needs. The customer's contact
information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when
necessary. Financial information that is collected is used to bill
the user for products and services.</p>
<p class="privacy">By registering with our Site, you give consent
for us to communicate with you at any of the contact points you
provide to us for any of the aforementioned purposes.&nbsp;
However, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by
following the instructions below in the section entitled
“Access and Control of Personal Information.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="privacy">You should review the following section to
understand when Splendora discloses personal information to
non-affiliated third parties.</p>
<p class="privacy">
<a name="disclosure"><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information.</strong></a>
</p>
<p class="privacy">We do not rent, sell, or share personal
information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies
without your prior consent except (i) as necessary to complete a
transaction you have requested, (ii) as necessary to perform
internal analyses and business functions, (iii) as part of a
business transfer, or (iv) when required by law or permitted to
protect our rights, property, or safety.&nbsp; The following
section describes these disclosure circumstances more fully.</p>
<ul class="privacy">
<li>
<strong>Consent.</strong>&nbsp; Unless you choose to do so, we will
not disclose your personal information to third parties for their
direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; With your consent, we may disclose
your personal information to third parties so that they may provide
you with products and services that you have requested.</li>
<li>
<strong>Transaction Processing and Business Functions.</strong>
&nbsp;We may share personal information with third-party vendors
who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate
our business, or who assist us in processing and completing
transactions for products and services that you have
requested.&nbsp; In the event that we use third-party vendors to
assist us in performing these functions, the third parties may not
use or disclose your personal information for any other
purpose.</li>
<li>
<strong>Internal Analysis.&nbsp;</strong> We may use information
about you for our own internal purposes; such as to estimate our
audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns as well as to
understand demographic, customer interest, and other trends among
our users.&nbsp; We may outsource these tasks and disclose personal
information about you to third parties, provided the use and
disclosure of your personal information by these third parties is
restricted to performance of such tasks.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Business Transfers</strong>:&nbsp; Information about our
users and the Site is one of our most important business
assets.&nbsp; Therefore, information about our users, including
personal information, will be disclosed as part of any merger or
acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide the Site or
fulfill products, sale or pledge of company assets as well as in
the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which
personal information would be transferred as one of the business
assets of the company.</li>
<li>
<strong>Protection of Splendora and Others</strong>:&nbsp; We may
release personal information in the good faith belief that release
is appropriate and necessary to comply with legal process or
authority (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to
enforce or apply our policies; to initiate, render, bill, and
collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our rights, property, or
personal safety of Splendora, our users, our employees, or the
public; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving
immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person
requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of
records without delay.</li>
