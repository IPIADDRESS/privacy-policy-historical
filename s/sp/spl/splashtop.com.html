<p><strong>Acceptance of the Privacy Policy</strong><br> This Privacy Policy is  incorporated into and is subject to the Splashtop Terms of Use, which are  available at <a class="links" href="http://splashtop.com/terms">http://splashtop.com/terms</a>.&nbsp;   By visiting and using the Site or Products,  you agree to abide by the   terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, and you  consent to the   collection, use and disclosure of your personal information and  other   non-personally identifying information by Splashtop in accordance with    the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If you do not agree to   the terms and  conditions of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use,   please do not provide us  with any information and do not use the Site   or the Products.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy  Updates</strong> <br> Due  to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature,&nbsp;we may need to update   this  Privacy Policy from time to time. If so,&nbsp;we will post the updated   Privacy  Policy on our Site located at <a class="links" href="http://splashtop.com/privacy">http://splashtop.com/privacy</a> so such notice is visible when users log-on for the  first time after   the changes are posted.&nbsp;  We may also send registered users of the Site   email notifications  notifying such users of any changes to the Privacy   Policy.&nbsp; If any change is unacceptable to you, you  shall cease using   the Site and the Products. &nbsp;If you do not cease using the Site and the   Products,  you will be deemed to have accepted the changes.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong><br> We may track the total number of visitors to our Site,  the number of   visitors to each page of our Site, the number of External Web  Site   (defined below) pages you have visited, technical information about your    computer, system and browser software and IP addresses.&nbsp; The aggregate   information extracted from this  data will be maintained, used and   disclosed in aggregate form only and will not  contain personally   identifiable information.&nbsp;  We may use such aggregate information to   analyze trends, improve the  Products we provide to our users,   administer the Site and gather broad  demographic information for   aggregate use.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong><strong> </strong><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Through the Site</span>:<br> You can generally visit our Site without revealing any  personally   identifiable information about yourself.&nbsp; However, in certain instances,   you may be  given the option to fill out a service registration,   complete a survey or other  form which could contain personally   identifiable information, such as user  identification name, an email   address, and/or any other information that you  voluntarily transmit   with your communication to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you visit a Splashtop web page, your browser  may send   certain information to our server, which we record.&nbsp; This information   may include the URL of the  referring web page, your browser and OS   type, etc.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Through the Products</span>:<br> Each Splashtop-based software product or service contains  an   activation time stamp, which is transparently collected by our server   the  first time you use the Product.&nbsp; You will  be assigned a unique   user ID number. In addition, as part of acceptance to use  the Product,   you are authorizing Splashtop to collect information about your  use of   the Product, including, without limitation, the number of times you use    the Product or various applications included with the Product, the   duration of use,  how many times and the type of technical problems that   occur during use of the  Product and technical information about your   computer and system software and  the Product version you are using.&nbsp; We   do  this for purposes such as analyzing how the Product is used,   diagnosing service  or to address technical problems, and improving   Product quality and features.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>About the Splashtop® Connect product</em>:</p>
<p> The  Splashtop® Connect product may report to our servers   the number of web pages  and search queries that you make, without   personally identifying you.&nbsp; We use this information, in an aggregate    format only, to improve our products.&nbsp; We  do not collect information   about which web page you view and which terms you  search for, nor do we   store any password or user information on our servers.</p>
<p> Splashtop® Connect allows you to connect to certain   Facebook features through the use of  APIs (Application Programming   Interfaces). The Facebook services and APIs vary  in the way they allow   other products, such as Splashtop® Connect, to connect to    them and are governed by their own separate Terms of Service.&nbsp; Please   visit Facebook's Terms of Service and  Privacy Policy currently located   at <a class="links" href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/terms.php</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p> Splashtop® Connect for Firefox provides a social sidebar,   created by  Yoono, which provides a service that allows connections to   various services.  These services vary in the way they allow third   parties such as Yoono to  connect to them, but, in any event, when you   use the social sidebar, your  privacy is governed by the Yoono privacy   policy, currently available online at <a class="links" href="http://www.yoono.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.yoono.com/privacy.html</a>, and the Yoono Terms of Use,  currently available online at <a class="links" href="http://www.yoono.com/terms.html" target="_blank">http://www.yoono.com/terms.html</a>. </p>

We may use firewalls,   password  protection, encryption, secure socket layer and take other   physical security  measures and place internal restrictions on who   within Splashtop may access  your data to help prevent unauthorized   access to your personally identifiable  information.</p>
