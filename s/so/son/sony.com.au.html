		<h3 id="purpose2">2.2 Marketing communications</h3> <p>Sony Australia may  use your information to provide you with newsletters and other communications  by post, email, telephone and/or text message (SMS), if you have provided your  prior consent or we are otherwise permitted to do so under applicable law. See  the Marketing Communication section below for more details.</p> <h3 id="purpose3">2.3 Personalised and targeted content,  recommendations and advertisements</h3> <p>Sony Australia may use the information it collects to  personalise and more effectively target its stores, services, content,  recommendations, adverts and communications. You may notice this  personalisation and targeting when you use Sony products and services, when we  contact you with marketing communications and when you visit our and third  party websites and services that show advertisements from us or our advertising  partners (for example, you might see an advertisement for a product that you  have recently viewed on one of our websites).     <br> The personalisation and targeting that you see on our  websites or in our online advertisements and communications may make use of  cookies set by us or our third party advertising partners. In other cases, our  services may have specific settings to control personalised content and you  should consult the privacy policy of the relevant service for more information.</p> <h3 id="purpose4">2.4 Statistics</h3> <p>Sony Australia may use your information to create anonymous,  aggregated statistics about the use of our websites, products, services and  loyalty programs, which we may share with third parties and/or make available  to the public.</p> <h3 id="purpose5">2.5 Product Improvement</h3> <p>Sony Australia may use your information to develop and  improve new and existing Sony products and services, recommendations,  advertisements and other communications and learn more about customers’  shopping preferences in general.</p>

		<h2 id="disclosure">3 Disclosure of personal information</h2> <h3 id="disclosure1">3.1 Disclosure of &nbsp;information by Sony Australia</h3> 
		<p>In general, Sony Australia does not sell, rent or otherwise  disclose information about you to third parties without your consent. However, there are exceptions:</p> <ul> <li>Other Sony Group companies</li> </ul> <p>We will share your personal information with all companies  that form a part of the Sony Group. If one Sony Group company collects your  personal information, other Sony Group companies may use and disclose that  personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, described in  section 2. </p>
		<p>Other Sony Group companies to whom we have disclosed your  personal information for one of these purposes may combine this information  with other details they hold about you. Unless that Sony Group company provides  you with their own privacy policy, they may use your personal details for the  purposes explained in this policy. </p> 
		<p>Our service providers</p>
		<p>We may use third party service providers to process  information on our behalf for the purposes outlined above. For example,  fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and emails, sending  text messages (SMS), providing marketing assistance, processing credit card  payments, providing fraud checking services and providing customer services.</p>
		<p>Our service providers operate only in accordance with our  instructions, in line with this policy, and are subject to appropriate  confidentiality and security obligations.</p>

		<h3 id="disclosure2">3.2 Sharing of information by you</h3> 
		<p>A number of our  online services allow you to upload and share messages, photos, video and other  content and links with others and/or create a publically accessible profile for  your account. For example: </p><ul> <li> the communities and forums area of our website,  allows you to post comments (with your account name), which are visible to  other users of that service; and </li> <li> other services allow you to share a link which  if clicked on may allow the recipient to access your uploaded content. </li> </ul> <p>You should not expect any information that you make  available to others via Sony Australia’s online services to be kept private or  confidential.

Instances when we will do this include:</p><ul> <li> when you have asked us to do so or we have your  consent; and </li> <li> when we are authorised or required by an  Australian law or a court/tribunal to do so. </li> </ul> <p>In order to engage in our business activities and functions,  we will disclose your personal information to parties in a number of countries,  including Singapore, New Zealand, the United States of America, Japan, the  United Kingdom, and Belgium. <b></b> <br> We will need to from time to time disclose your personal  information to parties in other countries not on this list. This will be on an  ad hoc or case by case basis and for the purposes for which we collected your  personal information.</p> 
		
		<h2 id="marketing">4 Marketing communications</h2> 
		
		<p>When you provide us with your contact details, such as when  you purchase a product, contact our customer support call centres or create an  account for one of our services, you may be given the opportunity to opt-in  to&nbsp; receiving various direct marketing  communications. Direct marketing involves the use and/or disclosure of personal  information to communicate directly with an individual to promote goods and  services. This includes newsletters and other communications by post, email,  telephone and/or text message (SMS) from Sony Australia and/or other Sony Group  companies, sending you details about the latest Sony products and services, such  as upgrades and special offers in which you may be interested. <br> Sony Australia may also give you the opportunity to opt-in  to receiving more targeted direct marketing communications. <br> You can change your marketing communication preferences at  any time:</p> <ul> <li> if you would like to unsubscribe from an email  sent to you, follow the ‘unsubscribe’ link and/or instructions placed  (typically) at the bottom of the email. But note that: </li> <li> if you use more than one e-mail address to shop  or contact Sony Australia, you will need to unsubscribe separately for each  email address; and </li> <li> this method will only unsubscribe for the  newsletter or other communication that you have received and you should use one  of the other methods if you wish to opt-out of all our marketing communications, </li> <li> if you have registered with Sony Australia online  and have a "My Sony" account, you may log-in and amend your marketing  communication preferences in the account settings; and </li> <li> you can contact us using the details in the  “Contact us” section (section 11) in order to change your marketing  communication preferences. </li> </ul> <p>Please note that we may occasionally send you important  information about Sony Australia products and services that you are using or  have used (such as order confirmations, product safety announcements and  service changes). These emails are not affected by your marketing communication  preferences.</p> 
		
		<h2 id="security">5 Security of your information</h2> 
		
		<h3 id="security1">5.1 What we do to protect your information</h3> <p>We hold your personal information in:</p> <ul> <li>computer systems;</li> <li>electronic databases;</li> <li>digital archives;</li> <li>telephone recordings; and</li> <li>hard copy or paper files.</li> </ul> <p>These storage mechanisms may be managed in a number of ways.  These may be managed or administered internally by a company in the Sony Group  and may be held locally in Australia, or, they could be managed by a third  party storage provider with whom the Sony Group has a contractual relationship  and be either managed locally or overseas. We will take all reasonable steps to  protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss, as well  as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. The ways we do this ,  include:</p> <ul> <li> using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when  collecting or transferring sensitive information, such as credit card details  (SSL encryption is designed to make the data unreadable by anyone but us); </li> <li>limiting physical access to our premises;</li> <li> limiting access to the information we collect  about you (for instance, only those of our personnel who need your information  to carry out our business activities are allowed access); </li> <li> requiring any third party providers to have  acceptable security measures to keep personal information secure; </li> <li> putting in place physical, electronic, and  procedural safeguards in line with industry standards; and </li> <li> destroying or de-identifying personal  information pursuant to the law and our record retention policies. </li> </ul> <h3 id="security2">5.2 What you should do to protect your information</h3> <p>As general best practice on the Internet, it is recommended  that individuals take great care with user accounts, and follow some basic  rules:</p> <ul> <li> <b>Do not</b> use trivial passwords (such as single dictionary words). </li> <li> <b>Do not</b> use the same password for multiple accounts. </li> <li> <b>Do</b> use very long passwords (at least 10 characters, but preferably much longer). </li> <li> <b>Do</b> use passwords which contain a combination of upper and lower case letters,  numbers and special characters e.g. $%^&amp; etc. </li> <li> <b>Do</b> keep passwords securely (never written down, or shared with anyone) and changed  periodically. </li> </ul> 
		
		<h2 id="cookies">6 Cookies and web beacons</h2> <p>Our websites use tracking technologies, such as “cookies”  and “web beacons”, to make use of the website and services as convenient as  possible and to collect information about the use of our websites and email  communications. For instance, these technologies may tell us which visitors  clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a website or email and  recognise your browser the next time you visit our websites. <br> Most web browsers are set to accept tracking technologies  such as cookies or web beacons. These tracking technologies do not themselves  personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s browser. These  tracking technologies allow Sony Australia to monitor the items an individual  may want to purchase as they move through the shopping site, and to record how  many people are using the different parts of the site. It is possible to set  your browser to refuse tracking technologies, however, this may limit the  services provided by Sony’s website.</p>
