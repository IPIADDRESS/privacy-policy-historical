    <h3><a name="What-data-Sony-needs">1. What data Sony needs</a></h3>
    <p>In general, you can visit Sony’s websites on the Internet without telling us who you are and without providing any Personal Data. There are times, however, where not providing the minimum necessary data as indicated in the relevant data entry sections and other pages in the relevant website, may result in Sony (or where relevant, a Sony Centre) not being able to sell you products and/or provide you with certain services, including after sales services.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <a href="javascript:;">www.sony.co.uk</a>  , <a href="javascript:;">www.sonystyle.co.uk</a> and <a href="javascript:;">www.sonycentres.co.uk </a> websites.</p>

<div class="cntPrivacySectionItem">
    <h3><a name="Why-Sony-collects-Personal-Data">2. Why Sony collects Personal Data</a></h3>
    <p>Personal Data means any data related to an identified or identifiable person, such as your name, age, telephone number, e-mail and mailing address ("Personal Data").</p>
    <p>Sony (and where relevant, a Sony Centre) would like to collect, maintain and use your Personal Data to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>fulfil its obligations under any sale and purchase contract, including checking that the payment is not made fraudulently, delivering your purchase to you or ensuring that you benefit from any relevant special offer or promotion, as well as any other contract with you;</li>
        <li>provide customer care, including services related to Sony businesses, such as warranty and after sales services;</li>
        <li>ask your opinions on Sony products and services and conduct product surveys;</li>
        <li>facilitate and process your searches and requests for information on Sony and its products and services;</li>
        <li>provide you with the latest Sony products and services information, including upgrades and special offers in which you may be interested;</li>
        <li>improve Sony products and services for you;</li>
        <li>conduct prize draws, contests and other promotional offers; and</li>
        <li>consider employing you if these data are requested on one of Sony’s job application websites.</li>
	</ul>
     <p>For these purposes, Sony may share, make available or transmit Personal Data to other Sony group companies within Europe and Sony group companies worldwide, including countries that do not have effective data protection laws and where you may have fewer legal rights in respect of your Personal Data. However, even in such countries, Sony group companies will use your Personal Data only for the purposes outlined above, and they are or will be subject to stringent policies and terms on Personal Data use and protection. (“Sony group companies” are Sony Corporation, and any entity, firm or corporation, the majority of whose shares or equity is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by Sony Corporation).</p>

        <h3><a name="How-Sony-collects-Personal-Data">3. How Sony collects Personal Data</a></h3>
        <p>Sony (and where relevant a Sony Centre) collect data about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with Sony, call Sony to make a purchase or request service, register your purchased product for after sales service, register to participate in an online survey or to any promotional offers, chat rooms, or on bulletin boards.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the most typical examples of how Sony (and where relevant a Sony Centre) collects your Personal Data.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>When you create a MySony profile or register a Sony product or service, we will collect your name, address data and the product or model name, etc;</li>
            <li>When you purchase a product from us and submit your payment details to us (see section 4 below, for further details); </li>
            <li>When you ask our customer service for help, we will keep a record of your name, the product(s) you bought, the technical issues at hand, and our advice to you, etc.</li>
            <li>When you want to participate in online communities, we need to record your account details and preferences. Some of our web sites allow for some personalisation of the content according to your interests, in which case we are recording your preferences.</li>
            <li>Keeping a record of your contact details and any resulting financial transaction in the context of a repair</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>Data collected online may also be combined with data you provide to Sony at other times. For example, during product registrations, calls to our call centres or at public events, such as exhibitions and trade shows. The Personal Data you provide in these cases may be consolidated with existing databases and stored, so that our customer data management systems are simplified.</p>

              <p>Certain Sony websites may employ an industry-wide technology called “cookies”. These are small pieces of data that are placed on your hard disk drive when you access a website or a certain part of a website. Cookies help Sony understand which parts of its websites are the most popular, where Sony visitors are going, and how much time they spend there.</p>
              <p>Sony uses cookies to study traffic patterns on its sites in order to improve website performance, to customise the user experience, and to better match the users’ interests and preferences. For example, Sony keeps track of the domains from which people visit, and also measures visitor activity on Sony websites. However, these tracking records are performed and maintained in ways that keep the data non-identifiable.</p>
              <p>Cookies may also be used to recognise your computer next time you visit a website. This might save you time (e.g. by ensuring that you don not have to register again) or help you by customising your internet settings.</p>
              <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies, they can be disabled by referring to your browser manufacturer’s instructions. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. For example, in Internet Explorer, you can go to the Tools/Internet options/Security and Privacy Tabs to adapt the browser to your expectations.</p>
              <p>Web beacons, also known as single pixel or clear gif technology, or action tags, may be used on our site. This technology tells us which visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a Sony Web page or a Sony email. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish which emails are actually opened. We use this information in order to optimise our content and services.</p>
              <p>These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies. In Microsoft Outlook 2003 or similar, downloading of pictures can be turned off on a site by site basis.</p>

If Sony becomes aware that the person submitting Personal Data, through any part of Sony’s websites, is a child, Sony will use reasonable efforts to delete that Personal Data from its files as soon as possible. Sony will also use reasonable efforts to ensure that this Personal Data is not used for any purpose, nor disclosed to any third party. As Sony does not seek to collect any Personal Data about children, and Sony deletes any data collected inadvertently as soon as it is discovered, Sony retains no data about children that could be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of data about their child before Sony has discovered and deleted the data, then Sony will of course honour that request.</p>
