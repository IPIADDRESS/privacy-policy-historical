      <p>Sonicbids Corporation ("Sonicbids") has created this web site 
        to provide an online platform for musicians, music promoters and other 
        music professionals. <br>
        <br>
        To assist you in using our www.sonicbids.com web site (the "Web Site" 
        or the "Site"), and to ensure a clear understanding of the relationship 
        arising from your use of our Site, we have created a Privacy Policy and 
        a set of <a href="http://www.sonicbids.com/about/terms.asp">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>. Our Privacy 
        Policy explains how we protect and treat contact and other information 
        you provide to us through the Site, and our Terms and Conditions of Use 
        govern your use of our Site generally. Please read our Privacy Policy 
        and our Terms and Conditions of Use carefully - they impose legal obligations 
        on you. By using or accessing our Site, you are acknowledging that you 
        have read and understood these terms and agree to be legally bound by 
        them.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="center"> <b>Privacy Policy</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") 
        constitutes the agreement between you and Sonicbids regarding your provision, 
        and our collection and use, of contact and other information you may provide 
        while using our Site. In this Privacy Policy, the words "you" 
        and "your" refer to any person accessing the Site, and the words 
        "we," "us," and "our" refer to Sonicbids. 
        <br>
        <br>
        By using our Site, you consent to this Privacy Policy. 
        <!--In addition, if you become 
  a registered user, during the registration process you will be prompted to click 
  an &quot;I Agree&quot; button, which further confirms your agreement with our 
  Privacy Policy. -->
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>1. Overview</b><br>
        We have organized the elements of our Privacy Policy in sections. If after 
        reading through the Privacy Policy you still have questions, please feel 
        free to contact us by clicking on the following link: <a href="mailto:info@sonicbids.com">contact us</a>.<br>
        <b><br>
        2. The Types Of Information You Potentially May Provide</b><br>
        This Privacy Policy only applies to information you provide to us online 
        while visiting or using our Site. It does not apply to information we 
        have obtained offline or through other traditional means. Information 
        you may provide in visiting or using our Site falls into two broad categories: 
        personally identifiable information, and aggregate information. "Personally 
        Identifiable Information" is information that can be used to identify 
        or contact you, such as your name, phone number, email address, or mailing 
        address. "Aggregate Information" is information that does not 
        identify you, and may include, for example, statistical information concerning 
        the web pages on our Site that users most frequent. Our Privacy Policy 
        governs both categories of information, as detailed below. <br>
        <b><br>
        2.1. Information That Identifies You: Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
        We allow you to decide whether you wish to provide us with Personally 
        Identifiable Information. Accordingly, we have structured our Web Site 
        so that you may visit our Site, and review a range of information about 
        bands, musicians other materials relating to the music industry, without 
        revealing your identity or providing any Personally Identifying Information. 
        <br>
        <br>
        One of our goals in creating this Web Site, however, is to enable bands 
        and musicians to post information about themselves and their music (for 
        example, through a Sonicbids Electronic Press Kit ("EPK™")), 
        and to enable music promoters and other music professionals to access 
        such postings and book appearances. Therefore, in order to post any such 
        information and book appearances, and in order to access certain other 
        materials or information from our Site, we ask that you register and provide 
        us with contact and other information, as provided below. <br>
        <b><br>
        2.1.1. Registration Information</b><br>
        To post information on our Site, and to obtain access to certain other 
        materials or information from our Site, we ask that you become a registered 
        user. Our registration forms will specify the information which you must 
        provide in order to enjoy the particular feature, and the information 
        which you may, at your option, choose to provide or withhold. Our obligations 
        concerning, and permitted uses of, any Personally Identifiable Information 
        that you provide during the registration process are set out below. <br>
        <br>
        As indicated above, you may use our Site without registering or submitting 
        any information to us. In that case, the only information we collect from 
        your visit will be Aggregate Information that does not identify you in 
        any way. Our obligations concerning, and permitted uses of, Aggregate 
        Information are also set out below. <br>
        <b><br>
        2.1.2. Surveys and Questionnaires </b><br>
        If you choose to participate in surveys or questionnaires which from time 
        to time we may post on the Site, we may ask that, in addition to providing 
        your responses, you also provide contact and other Personally Identifiable 
        Information. If we link, or combine in any way your responses with your 
        Personally Identifiable Information, we will treat the combined information 
        as Personally Identifiable Information under our Privacy Policy, as provided 
        below. If we separate your responses from, and they are independent of 
        any Personally Identifiable Information, such that a third party reviewing 
        your responses would be unable to link the responses to you or your practice, 
        the responses will be treated as Aggregate Information under our Privacy 
        Policy, again as provided below. <br>
        <b><br>
        2.1.3. Email And Other Direct Communications</b><br>
        From time to time, you may wish to provide us with comments and feedback 
        concerning our Site generally. By communicating with us for these purposes, 
        you may provide us with your email address and other Personally Identifiable 
        Information. We will handle such information that you provide in this 
        manner in accordance with our Privacy Policy for Personally Identifiable 
        Information, set out below. <br>
        <b><br>
        2.2. Information That Does Not Identify You: Aggregate Information</b><br>
        When you browse our Site, the choices you make may provide information 
        concerning your interests and concerning the appeal and efficacy of associated 
        Site features. For example, if you spend time browsing information on 
        events taking place in Georgia and Florida, this suggests that you may 
        have an interest in events in the Southeast generally. If a number of 
        visitors spend time browsing information on events taking place in Georgia 
        and Florida, this may suggest that we have designed this portion of our 
        Site effectively. <br>
        <br>
        Information concerning our visitors' activities at the Site - which pages 
        they visit, and how long they view these pages, for example - is Aggregate 
        Information. This information does not identify a particular user, but 
        does provide potentially useful data concerning our users' preferences 
        and the efficacy and interest of our Site's features. The manner in which 
        we collect Aggregate Information is set out below.<br>
        <br>
        <b>2.2.1. Cookies</b><br>
        We collect Aggregate Information about your use of our Site through cookies 
        and similar Internet technologies. "Cookies" are small text 
        files that a web site can use to recognize repeat users, to facilitate 
        the user's ongoing access to and use of the site, and to compile aggregate 
        data to improve the site and focus advertising. Cookies work as follows: 
        a web site will send a cookie to your browser that uniquely associates 
        your computer with information stored at the site. Your browser places 
        the cookie in its cookies file. When you next access that site on your 
        computer, the site recognizes the cookie, makes the stored information 
        available, and adds new information based on the present visit. <br>
        <br>
        Our cookies do not collect or retain your name or other Personally Identifying 
        Information. In addition, no third parties are permitted to use cookies 
        created at our Site for their own purposes. <br>
        <br>
        We treat all information collected through cookies and similar Internet 
        technologies as Aggregate Information; our obligations concerning, and 
        permitted uses of, Aggregate Information are set out below. <br>
        <br>
        <b>2.2.2. Disabling Cookies</b><br>
        You may choose not to allow us to collect information through cookies. 
        If you wish, you can set your browser software to reject cookies, and 
        most browsers provide instructions for disabling the cookies feature in 
        their "Help" section. Because cookies can be used to provide 
        certain functionality, if you disable your browser's cookies feature, 
        certain elements of our Site may be unavailable to you. <br>
        <br>
        <b>2.2.3. IP Addresses </b><br>
        A so-called "Internet Protocol" (IP) address is associated with 
        your computer's connection to the Internet. We use your computer's IP 
        address to maintain contact with you as you navigate through our Site. 
        We also may use your computer's IP address to provide you with personalized 
        content. Similar to cookies, your computer's IP address by itself does 
        not identify you personally. We treat IP addresses, therefore, as Aggregate 
        Information, as provided below. If your IP address is combined by us with 
        any Personally Identifiable Information, the combined information will 
        be treated by us as Personally Identifiable Information, as set out below.<br>
        <br>
        <b>2.2.4. Advertisers' Collection Of Information</b><br>
        With Internet technology, it is possible for advertisers, as well as site 
        hosts, to collect information through the use of cookies and other technologies, 
        such as so-called "clear GIF" files. We have no control over, 
        and cannot necessarily protect against, the practices or policies of advertisers 
        or other web site hosts using such technologies. <br>
        <b><br>
        3. How We Use The Information You Provide </b><br>
        The following section describes how we use the information you provide, 
        and details the specific obligations we undertake to preserve your privacy. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3.1. Use of Contact Information</b><br>
        We use Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us on our Site 
        to post your EPK™ and other submissions, and for other purposes specific 
        to our Site. In connection with postings you may request we make on the 
        Site, users of our Site shall have access to such information - which 
        may include personal information about you. For example, your name, address, 
        telephone number and/or email address may be included in your EPK™ 
        listing or other submissions you request we post for contact purposes. 
        <br>
        <br>
        From time to time, we also may use Personally Identifiable Information 
        you give to us to provide you with information concerning newsletters, 
        updates, and other materials related to the purposes of our Site. We also 
        will use this information to respond to questions and comments from you, 
        and to inform you of changes to our Privacy Policy or Terms and Conditions 
        of Use. You are free at any time to opt-out of receiving email and other 
        information we may send to you by following the directions set out below. 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        3.2. We Use Aggregate Information Only In Ways That Do Not Identify You</b><br>
        To measure our visitors' interest in and use of various areas of our Site, 
        and for other purposes set out below, we collect Aggregate Information 
        -- which is information that does not identify you. Aggregate Information 
        obtained through cookies, for example, allows us to monitor how many users 
        are visiting our Site, and what areas of the Site present the most interest 
        to our users. We are able then to use this information to improve the 
        functionality and interest of Site. We also use Aggregate Information 
        to prepare statistical and other summary analyses of our users' behavior 
        and characteristics. <br>
      </p>
      <p>We may share Aggregate Information, and reports based on this Information, 
        with third parties unrelated to the Site. Rest assured, however, that 
        no such Aggregate Information that we provide to third parties will allow 
        anyone to identify you, or determine anything personal about you. For 
        example, we might report to unrelated third parties (a) the number of 
        users of our Site; (b) the materials our users review while at our Site; 
        or (c) the fact that "45% of our users live on the East Coast." 
        We may charge third parties for this information, and we may or may not 
        limit the third parties' use of this information. We do not allow third 
        parties to attempt to make Aggregate Information personally identifiable 
        by, for example, seeking to combine it with other information.<br>
        <br>
        <b>3.3. Any Information Linked With Your Personal Information Is Treated 
        As "Personally Identifiable Information"</b><br>
        To advance the goals of our Site, we may link (a) the Personally Identifiable 
        Information you have provided; with (b) Aggregate Information concerning 
        (for example) your interests and preferences, as collected through our 
        cookies. Linking this information will allow us to create information 
        packages and services that are better tailored to your interests and preferences. 
        Among other effects, linking this information may allow us generally to 
        improve and focus our Site. If we combine or link any information with 
        your Personally Identifiable Information, the resulting combination will 
        be treated as Personally Identifiable Information under this Privacy Policy. 
        Accordingly, please be aware that in such instances, personal information 
        about you may be made generally available on the Site in connection with 
        postings you may request we make on the Site, as set forth above. <br>
        <br>
        <b>4. How We Safeguard Information We Collect</b><br>
        We have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized 
        disclosure of information you provide to us. These systems are structured 
        to deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing this information. 
        Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, 
        however, we cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information 
        you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third 
        parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access. <br>
        <b><br>
        5. How To Obtain Access to Information You Have Provided, And How To Remove 
        Your Information From Our Database</b><br>
        We allow you at any time to update, correct, or delete Personally Identifiable 
        Information you have provided us. After submitting your registration information, 
        you can view and modify this information within the "Edit Profile" 
        page of the Site.<br>
        <br>
        If you request, we will remove your name and other Personally Identifiable 
        Information from our databases. Please understand, however, that it may 
        be impossible to remove this information completely, due to backups and 
        records of deletions. If you wish to remove your name and other Personally 
        Identifiable Information from our database, please contact us.<br>
        <br>
        Because Aggregate Information does not personally identify our users, 
        we do not provide our users with access to Aggregate Information, and 
        users may not update, revise, or delete any Aggregate Information. <br>
        <br>
        <b>6. Additional General Provisions</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>6.1. Privacy Protection for Children</b><br>
        Our Site is not directed at children, and we will not accept or request 
        personal information from individuals we know to be under 13. If we learn 
        that a child under 13 has provided us with Personally Identifiable Information, 
        we will delete this information from our databases, in accordance with 
        our deletion policy, set out above.<br>
        <br>
        <b>6.2. Participation in Online Discussions</b><br>
        If we include a "chat" or "forum" feature to the Site, 
        you may decide to participate in an online discussion. Please keep in 
        mind that any information you provide while participating in an online 
        chat or forum will be available to all participants. These participants, 
        and their transferees, may use Personally Identifiable Information and 
        other information you disclose in this manner, to contact you and for 
        other purposes. Accordingly, if we choose to provide such features at 
        the Site, we ask that you participate prudently, as this Privacy Policy 
        will not cover the information you disclose in online discussions at our 
        Site. <br>
        <br>
        <b>6.3. Links To Other Web Sites</b><br>
        To give you access to other information relating to the music industry, 
        from time to time we may include on the Web Site certain links to other 
        sites. We provide these links as a convenience, and we do not endorse 
        the content or services offered by, or the privacy policies in place at, 
        these other sites. <br>
        <br>
        Our Privacy Policy covers only information we collect at the Site, and 
        other sites to which we link may have privacy policies that differ considerably 
        from our Privacy Policy. We have structured our Site to make it reasonably 
        clear when you leave our Web Site and enter another web site. We encourage 
        you to review the privacy policies of each site you visit through our 
        links to ensure you are comfortable with these policies. We are not responsible 
        for the conduct or policies of these third parties. <br>
        <b><br>
        6.4. Court Orders, Subpoenas, And Other Required Disclosures</b><br>
        There are two exceptions to our Privacy Policy. First, we may disclose 
        Personally Identifiable Information as may be required in legal proceedings, 
        or in response to a subpoena, court order, or administrative order compelling 
        disclosure. Second, in cases involving a threat of imminent harm to you 
        or others, we may release such information to prevent or mitigate the 
        threat. In any such case, we will seek to limit the scope of disclosure, 
        and will disclose only such information as is reasonably required to fulfill 
        the purpose of the disclosure. <br>
        <br>
        <b>6.5. Changes in Our Privacy Policy </b><br>
        From time to time we may revise our Privacy Policy. We will post these 
        changes here, in our Privacy Policy. Your use of our Site following any 
        such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the Privacy 
        Policy, as changed. <br>
        <br>
        <b>6.6. Relationship to Term of Use</b><br>
        In addition to this Privacy Policy, your use of our Site is also subject 
        to our Terms and Conditions of Use (our "Terms of Use"). The 
        provisions of our Terms of Use are incorporated herein, including, without 
        limitation, Sections 12 (Choice of Law and Jurisdiction), 14 (Assignment), 
        17 (Severability), 18 (Survival) and 19 (Complete Agreement). <br>
        <br>
        <b>7. Your Consent</b><br>
        By using our Web Site, you consent to our collection and use of information, 
        in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with some, 
        or all of the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from becoming 
        a registered user, or from visiting our Site. <br>
