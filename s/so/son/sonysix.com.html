The Sites may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, zip code, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests. If we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. Please note that information submitted to the Sites via a "contact us" or other similar function may not receive a response. We will not use the information provided to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.</p>
<p>	<strong><em>Information We Collect Automatically As You Access and Use the Sites</em></strong></p>
<p>	Whenever you visit or interact with the Sites or SPN content, SPN, as well as any third-party advertisers, content providers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Sites are accessed and used ("<strong>Usage Information</strong>"). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page &amp; video views. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if SPN associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, SPN treats it as Personal Information.<br>
	SPN also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier ("<strong>Device Identifier</strong>") for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, "<strong>Device</strong>") you use to access the Sites. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the Sites.</p>
<p>	The technologies used on the Sites to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include:</p>
<p><strong><em>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies&nbsp;</em></strong><br>
	By using the Site, you consent to our cookies.<br><strong>Cookie:</strong>&nbsp;A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-into or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.

A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site or in an email. The use of a clear gif allows the Site to measure your actions in opening the page that contains the clear gif.</p>
<p>	<strong>Embedded Scripts:</strong>&nbsp;An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>

If you choose to voluntarily disclose User Submissions, the protections of this Privacy Policy will not cover such disclosure of information. Think carefully before you post and use caution before disclosing any Personal Information.<br>
Also, functionality on the Sites may permit interactions between the Sites and a third party web site or service, such as enabling you to "like" a product on our Site or "share" content to other web sites or services. If you choose to "like" or "share" content on the Site or to otherwise post information from or via the Site to a third party's web site, service, feature or application, that information will become public and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of our Site.<br>

We may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other Personal Information with your User Submissions, and SPN may use the content, or any portion of the content, for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities. For full terms and conditions regarding User Submissions you submit to the Sites, please review our Terms of Use.<br><strong><em>"You shall not create, Submit, host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, update or share any information/ User Submission on the Site that—</em></strong><br><strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;belongs to another person and to which the user does not have any right to;</em></strong><br><strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is grossly harmful, harassing, blasphemous defamatory, obscene, pornographic, pedophilic, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically objectionable, disparaging, relating or encouraging money laundering or gambling, or otherwise unlawful in any manner whatever;</em></strong><br><strong><em>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harm minors in any way;</em></strong><br><strong><em>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infringes any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights;</em></strong><br><strong><em>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violates any law for the time being in force;</em></strong><br><strong><em>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deceives or misleads the addressee about the origin of such messages or communicates any information which is grossly offensive or menacing in nature;</em></strong><br><strong><em>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impersonate another person;</em></strong><br><strong><em>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer resource;</em></strong><br><strong><em>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threatens the unity, integrity, defense, security or sovereignty of India, friendly relations with foreign states, or public order or causes incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence or prevents investigation of any offence or is insulting any other nation"</em></strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES</strong><br>
SPN may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another web site and you opt-in to receive information from SPE, &nbsp;that web site will forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature on our Sites (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or otherwise linking the Sites with another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Sites with that third party web site or service, which may then collect information about your visits to our Sites and may publish that activity as you request to your "profile" or similar feature with that third party (such as if you choose to share content you find on one of our Sites with your "connections" on the third party's web site or service). The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. However, the information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us or with other third parties, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party's web site or service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site or service give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections'" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.</p>
<p>	We may also supplement the information we collect about you through the Sites with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with information we collect through the Sites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.</p>
<p>	<strong>8. AD SERVING AND TRAFFIC MEASUREMENT SERVICES WE MAY USE; HOW TO "OPT OUT" OF RECEIVING ADVERTISING RELEVANT TO YOU</strong></p>
<p>	SPN licenses technology to serve advertisements on its own sites and within its videos and other content as that content is served across the Internet. In addition, SPN may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements and third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Sites and viewing of our content. We do not share Personal Information with these third parties, but ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or analytics service providers may set and access their own&nbsp;<strong><em>cookies</em></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><em>web beacons</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>embedded scripts</em></strong>&nbsp;on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information. With regard to advertisements, we and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the Sites and other web sites.&nbsp;<strong><em>Cookies</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>web beacons</em></strong>, including those set by third party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, or to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share Usage Information about visitors to the Sites with third party advertising companies for the same purposes. We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements.</p>
<p>	<strong>9. UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION AND OPTING OUT FROM EMAIL, SMS AND MMS COMMUNICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>	SPN may provide web pages or other mechanisms through which you can correct or update some of the Personal Information you have provided to us, including, without limitation, through registration with the Sites. You may opt out of receiving e-mail newsletters by following the opt-out instructions provided to you in those e-mails. If you sign up to receive SMS or MMS messages that may be offered on the Sites, you may unsubscribe from any SMS or MMS messages received by replying "STOP". Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account or use of the Sites and these transactional account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from marketing communications. In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Sites. We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.<br><strong>10. SECURITY</strong></p>
