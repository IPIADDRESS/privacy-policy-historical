<b><u>Your Privacy</u></b>
</p><p>
At Sony we believe our online visitors have a right
to know our practices regarding the information we collect when you visit our
Web sites and what type of information is collected. The guidelines contained
herein apply only to your visit to the Web sites operated by or for Sony
Electronics Inc. and the entities it controls (collectively, “SEL”).  These sites 
include those that contain “sel.sony.com” and those that contain “sonystyle.com” 
in their URLs.  Sites which are linked to/from these sites (including via banner ads) 
may have different policies; therefore, please review the privacy policy notices 
on those sites for details.
</p><p>
While SEL does not generally require that
you provide us with personally identifiable information to visit and use the
SEL sites, please note that in order to participate in some activities, it will
be necessary for you to provide this information.  If you choose not to provide 
it for those activities, you may not be able to participate in them.
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Collection of Information: Cookies; Personal</u></b>
</p><p>
For each visitor to an SEL Web site, SEL’s Web server automatically recognizes and
stores information such as the visitor’s IP address/Domain name combination.   We 
use this information to follow visitor traffic patterns through our sites for 
purposes such as enhancing its usability.  Your computer provides this information 
automatically each time you log on, unless you’ve activated blocking technology 
available in some browsers.
</p><p>
When you visit SEL’s sites or advertisements appearing thereon, or use one or more 
of the SEL Web site services, we may use an industry-wide technology called 
“cookies” which stores certain information on your computer and which will 
allow us to customize your experience to better match your interests and preferences 
or to simply facilitate your signing in to use the services.  Most browsers will 
allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, 
or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.  However, if you block or erase 
cookies, we may not be able to restore any preferences or customization settings 
you previously specified and our ability to personalize your online experience 
would be limited.  Please refer to your browser instructions or “help” screen to 
learn more about these functions.
</p><p>
Additionally, SEL may ask you to provide “personal information”, meaning individually
identifiable information such as your email address, name, mailing address,
telephone number, social security number, credit card number, or persistent
identifier (such as a customer number held in a cookie) which is associated
with individually identifiable information, to enable you to participate in
contests, chat rooms, on bulletin boards, to fill out a registration, or to order 
products and services using these sites.  SEL may combine the information you provide 
on our Web sites with information we may collect offline from you or from third 
parties so that we can more effectively tailor our site, services and offerings to you.
</p><p>
<b><i>Unless you instruct us otherwise,</i></b> SEL may contact you to provide 
information about products, services, promotions, contests, or other activities 
or offerings that may be of interest to you.  You can instruct us whether
or not you wish to be contacted by checking or unchecking the box indicating
your preference at the place where your information is collected, or by other
means (such as an email request).  In addition, with each communication you receive 
from SEL, you will be given the opportunity to indicate if you do not wish 
to receive future communications.
</p><p>
SEL will not share the personal information you provide on the SEL Web sites with 
any other parties, except (a) with your consent, (b) as may be permitted or required 
by law or court order and/or (c) to persons or companies with whom SEL contracts 
to carry out the internal operations of the site or our business (for example, 
to send you a promotional item that you have requested on the site.)
</p><p>
<b><i>With your consent,</i></b> SEL may share your personal information with 
other affiliated Sony companies (i.e., (i) Sony Corporation, (ii) any company 
of which more than 50% of its outstanding shares are owned by Sony Corporation, 
directly or indirectly, and (iii) any company with the name “SONY” as a part of 
its trade name) who may want to contact you about products, services or other 
offerings that may be of interest to you.  Further, <b><i>with your consent,</i></b>,
SEL may share your personal information with specific third parties outside 
of the Sony group of companies who may want to contact you about products, 
services or other offerings that may be of interest to you.  SEL will seek 
to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either 
by an “opt-out” or “opt-in” method, or by other means (such as an email request).
If you consent to receiving communications from any of these affiliated Sony 
companies, or third parties, you will need to communicate with them directly 
if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications.
<br><br>
<b><u>Security</u></b>
</p><p>
SEL takes great care in maintaining the security of your personal information and 
in preventing unauthorized access to it through the use of appropriate technology
and internal procedures. However, SEL does not guarantee that unauthorized access 
will never occur.
<br><br>
<b><u>Notice To/Regarding Children Under the Age of 13</u></b>
</p><p>
SEL believes that
children using the Internet require special protection, and we urge parents or
guardians to explain Internet safety to their children.  Parents are
urged to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the
types of content available on the SEL sites and the Internet in general.
Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers to
help create a safer environment for children.
</p><p>
If you are under 13 years of age, you should not provide any personally
identifiable information on these sites without the knowledge and permission of
your parent or guardian. If SEL learns that you are under 13 years of age, SEL
will not maintain or use any personally identifiable information about you
without the verifiable consent of your parent or guardian, except as allowed by
law. This may mean that you will be unable to participate in some activities on
the sites without that verifiable consent.
</p><p>
If a child under 13 years of age wishes to participate in any SEL Web site
activity, or wishes to take advantage of a product or service offering,
available to children, and to do so necessitates the furnishing of any of the
child’s personal information, please note the following:
<blackquote>
</blackquote></p><ul type="i">
<li>
The names, addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses of the operators
collecting or maintaining personal information from children through this Web
site are:
</li>
<pre>  Sony Electronics Inc.
  1 Sony Drive
  Park Ridge, New Jersey 07656
  Telephone:  201-930-4800
  e-mail address:  PIM@am.sony.com
<br>
  Sony Electronics e-Solutions Company LLC
  155 Tice Boulevard
  Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey 07677
  Telephone: 201-930-4800
  e-mail address:  PIM@am.sony.com
</pre>
<p>
</p><li>
The types of personal information collected from children may include the name, 
email address, home address, telephone number and/or any other information 
reasonably necessary for the child to participate in a particular activity.   
This information may be collected directly and/or passively (e.g., through 
a web server that automatically recognized and stores information such as a 
visitor’s IP address/domain name combination). 
</li>
<p>
</p><li>
The information collected may be used for purposes such as fulfillment of a requested
transaction, record keeping, marketing back to the child, or making it publicly
available through a chat room or by other means.
</li>
<p>
</p><li>
Unless specific consent is obtained from the child’s parent or guardian, the child’s
personal information will not be disclosed to third parties who are not
contractors hired to carry out the internal operations of the Web sites, other
than as may be required or permitted by law.  We have required, or will require, 
such contractors to agree to use personal information of site visitors only for 
the purposes of carrying out these operations and to keep such information 
confidential.  A parent or guardian has the option of consenting to the collection 
and use of the child’s personal information without consenting to the disclosure 
of that information to third parties.
</li>
<p>
</p><li>
SEL is prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the 
child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to 
participate in such activity; and 
</li>
<p>
</p><li>
A parent can review and have deleted the child's personal information, can refuse 
to permit further collection or use of the child's information, and can revoke or 
limit consents previously given.  For instructions on how to do so, please send 
an email to: <a href="mailto:PIM@am.sony.com">PIM@am.sony.com</a> or write to us at:
<pre><i>
Sony Electronics Inc.
Personal Information Management Office
1 Sony Drive

</i>
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Before any collection of a child’s personal information takes place at a Web site
directed to children or where SEL is knowingly collecting children’s personal
information, the child will be asked to provide his/her parent’s or guardian's 
e-mail address.  SEL will then send an email (the "Initial Notification") 
to the parent/guardian indicating, among other things, the information that 
the child is requested to provide, the intended use(s) of the information and 
information on how the parent/guardian can, at their election, delete the child's 
information from SEL’s database or records. Upon receipt of the Initial 
Notification, a parent or guardian may respond back to SEL to grant his/her 
consent or to deny consent in which case SEL will delete the parent or 
guardian’s email address.  Upon SEL’s receipt of the parent/guardian consent, 
SEL will send a confirming email to the parent/guardian’s email address.
</p><p>
If
SEL desires to use a child’s information for purposes other than that for which
the parent/guardian consent was previously given, SEL will not do so without
first getting the parent/guardian consent.
</p><p>
<b><u>Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Aggregated Information</u></b>
</p><p>
SEL may also collect, aggregate and maintain anonymous aggregated information 
about the visitors to our Web sites, such as visitors hobbies, interests, 
purchasing habits, music preferences, and the like.  This data can then
be used to tailor SEL’s Web site content and advertising to deliver a better
experience for our visitors.  SEL may also share such aggregate information 
about our visitors with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other 
third parties; for example, to inform them, for example, about the percentage 
of male/female visitors or percentage of visitors within a particular age range. 
</p><p>
<b><u>Consent to Processing:</u></b>
</p><p>
By providing any personal information to the SEL Sites, all users, including
without limitation users in the member states of the European Union, fully
understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such
information in the United States of America.
</p><p>
<b><u>Policy Governs Use; Changes to Privacy Policy</u></b>
</p><p>
The terms of this policy will govern the use and any information collected 
while it is in place.  SEL reserves the right to change this policy at any time, 
so please re-visit this page as often as you wish.
</p><p>
<b><u>Questions:</u></b>

you have any questions or comments about our personal information practices or
about this privacy statement, please feel free to send us an email at <a href="mailto:PIM@am.sony.com">PIM@am.sony.com</a> or write us at:
