<p align="left" class="style4">At Sony, we believe you have a right to know what type of 
information we may collect when you interact with us and our 
practices with respect to that information. The guidelines 
contained herein apply only to information collected by or for 
Sony Electronics Inc. and the entities it controls (collectively, 
“SEL”). This includes, among other things, websites operated by 
or for SEL, most of which contain “sel.sony.com” or 
“sonystyle.com” in their URLs. Sites which are linked to/from 
these sites (including sites of other Sony affiliated companies 
(e.g., Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 
Sony Computer Entertainment America) and via banner ads may 
have different policies; therefore, please review the privacy 
policy notices on those sites for details. </p>
<p align="left" class="style4">While SEL does not generally require that you provide us with 
personally identifiable information (for example, in order to visit 
and use the SEL sites), please note that in order to participate in 
some activities, it will be necessary for you to provide this 
information. If you choose not to provide it for those activities, 
you may not be able to participate in them. </p>
<p align="left"><span class="style3"><b>[Notice to California Residents – Your 
California Privacy Rights</b>: </span><span class="style4">If you are a California resident, you have the 
right to receive: a) information identifying any third party 
company(ies) to whom Sony Electronics Inc. may have disclosed, 
within the past year, personal information pertaining to you and 
your family for that company’s direct marketing purposes; and b) 
a description of the categories of personal information disclosed. To obtain such information, please email your request to <a href="mailto:Privacy@am.sony.com">Privacy@am.sony.com</a>.</span><span class="style3"><b>]</b></span></p>
<p align="left" class="style3"><b>Collection of Information: </b></p>
<p align="left" class="style4">For each visitor to an SEL Web site, SEL’s Web server 
automatically recognizes, collects and/or stores information such 
as the visitor’s IP address/Domain name combination and any 
referring sites. SEL may use several technologies to accomplish 
this. Examples of such technologies are cookies and Web 
beacons. </p>
<p align="left" class="style4">When you visit SEL’s Web sites or advertisements appearing 
thereon, or use one or more of the SEL Web site services, or 
receive emails from SEL we may use an industry-wide 
technology called "cookies" which stores certain information on 
your computer and which will allow us to customize your 
experience to better match your interests and preferences or to 
simply facilitate your signing in to use the services. Most 
browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer 
hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning 
before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies, 
we may not be able to restore any preferences or customization 
settings you previously specified and our ability to personalize 
your online experience would be limited. Please refer to your 
browser instructions or “help” screen to learn more about these 
functions. SEL may also itself use, or engage third parties to use, 
Web beacons for researching certain usage and activities on our 
Web site. The information collected by SEL or requested from 
third parties through these Web beacons is in an aggregate, non-
individually identifiable form and is used to find out more about 
users including demographic information and usage patterns for 
more accurate reporting and to improve the effectiveness of our 
marketing. SEL may also itself use, or engage third parties to 
use, pixel tags or other technology to research or track your 
usage activities with respect to emails from us. </p>
<p align="left" class="style4">SEL may ask you to provide “personal information”, meaning 
individually identifiable information such as your email address, 
name, mailing address, telephone number, social security 
number, credit card number, or persistent identifier (such as a 
customer number held in a cookie) which is associated with 
individually identifiable information, to enable you to participate in 
contests, chat rooms, on bulletin boards, to fill out a registration, 
or to order products and services using these sites. SEL may 
combine the information you provide on our Web sites with 
information we may collect offline from you or from third parties 
so that we can more effectively tailor our site, services and 
offerings to you. </p>
<p align="left"><span class="style3"><b><i>SEL will not share the personal 
information you provide with any other parties</i></b>, <b><i>except </i></b></span><span class="style4">(a) to other 
affiliated Sony companies (i.e., (i) Sony Corporation, (ii) any 
company of which 50% or more of its outstanding shares are owned by Sony Corporation, directly or indirectly, and (iii) any 
company with the name “SONY” as a part of its trade name) who 
may want to contact you about products, services or other 
offerings that may be of interest to you (SEL and such affiliates 
being collectively referred to as “Sony”), (b) with your consent 
(see paragraph below), (c) as may be required by law or court 
order, (d) to persons or companies with whom SEL engages to 
carry out or provide support for the operations of the sites or our 
business, or (e) to appropriate third parties, including law 
enforcement or other government agencies, in connection with a 
criminal investigation, fraud prevention, or other legal action or if 
SEL reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to protect SEL, 
its customers, or the public. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="style3"><b><i>Unless you instruct us 
otherwise</i></b></span>, <span class="style4">SEL may contact you to 
provide information about products, services, promotions, 
contests, or other activities or offerings that may be of interest to 
you. You can instruct us whether or not you wish to be contacted 
by checking or unchecking the box indicating your preference, as 
applicable, at the place where your information is collected. In 
addition, with each communication you receive from SEL, you 
will be given the opportunity to indicate if you do not wish to

Aggregated Information </b></p>
<p align="left" class="style4">SEL may also collect, aggregate and maintain anonymous 
information about you, such as your hobbies, interests, 
purchasing habits, music preferences, and the like. This data can 
then be used to tailor SEL’s promotions, advertising, and 
communications to deliver a better experience for you. SEL may 
also share such aggregate information with advertisers, business 
partners, sponsors, and other third parties; for example, to inform 
them about the percentage of male/female visitors to our site or 
the percentage of visitors within a particular age range. </p>
<p align="left" class="style3"><b>Security </b></p>
<p align="left" class="style4">SEL takes great care in maintaining the security of your personal 
information and in preventing unauthorized access to it through 
the use of appropriate technology and internal procedures. 
However, SEL does not guarantee that unauthorized access will 
never occur. </p>
<p align="left" class="style3"><b>Notice To/Regarding Children Under 
the Age of 13 </b></p>
<p align="left" class="style4">SEL believes that children using the Internet require special 
protection, and we urge parents or guardians to explain Internet 
safety to their children. Parents are urged to spend time online 
with their children to become familiar with the types of content 
available on the SEL sites and the Internet in general. Control 
tools are available from online services and software 
manufacturers to help create a safer environment for children. </p>
<p align="left" class="style4">If you are under 13 years of age, you should not provide any 
personally identifiable information (for example, your last name, 
home address or e-mail address) on these sites without the 
knowledge and permission of your parent or guardian. If SEL 
learns that you are under 13 years of age, SEL will not maintain 
or use any personally identifiable information about you without 
the verifiable consent of your parent or guardian, except as 
allowed by law. This may mean that you will be unable to 
participate in some activities on the sites without that verifiable 
consent. If a child under 13 years of age wishes to participate in 
any SEL Web site activity, or wishes to take advantage of a 
product or service offering available to children, and to do so 
necessitates the furnishing of any of the child’s personal 
information, please note the following: </p>

<p align="left" class="style4">Except as permitted by law, before any collection of a child’s 
personal information takes place at a Web site directed to 
children or where SEL is knowingly collecting children’s personal 
information, the child will be asked to provide his/her parent’s or 
guardian's e-mail address so that SEL can contact the child’s 
parent or guardian. SEL will then send an email (the "Initial 
Notification") to the parent/guardian indicating, among other 
things, the information that the child is requested to provide, the 
intended use(s) of the information and information on how the 
parent/guardian can, at their election, delete the child's 
information from SEL’s database or records. Upon receipt of the 
Initial Notification, a parent or guardian may respond back to 
SEL to grant his/her consent or to deny consent in which case 
SEL will delete the parent or guardian’s email address and any 
other personal information, if any, previously obtained for 
securing parental consent. Upon SEL’s receipt of the 
parent/guardian consent, SEL will send a confirming email to the 
parent/guardian’s email address or take such other action as 
may be required to verify the consent. </p>
<p align="left" class="style4">
If SEL desires to use a child’s information for purposes other 
than that for which the parent/guardian consent was previously 
given, SEL will not do so without first getting the parent/guardian 
consent. </p>

<p align="left" class="style4">By providing any personal information to SEL Sites, all persons, 
including without limitation persons in the member states of the 
European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to 
the collection and processing of such information in the United 
States of America.</p>

this policy at any time, so please re-visit this page as often as 
you wish. In case of any material change, we will change the
