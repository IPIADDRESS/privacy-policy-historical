The ISA And Cookies</b><br>

<font face="Verdana" color="black" size="2"><p align="left"></p><p align="justify">  

The ISA has very strict Cookie, Privacy and Rights policies.<br><br>

However, the International Songwriters Association may modify any of its Policies from time to time. The ISA will notify any changes by posting the changes here. Any changes to our Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted. Your use of the site, or your provision of personal information to use the  Services following such changes, will indicate your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.<br><br>

If you do not accept any of our Policies, please do not use this Site, or our Services.<br><br>

This page was last revised on 10th June 2018<br><br>

<b>COOKIES</b><br><br>

Cookies are text files that a Web browser stores on a user’s machine. They can used by websites for authentication, storing website information/preferences, such as the pages you visit, how often you visit, how long you stay on each page etc.<br><br>
However, they can also be used to work out your location, your IP address, the type of hardware you are using to browse the site, etc. <br><br>
And if they are really intrusive, they can renain after you have left the site which put them there in the first place, and perhaps track which other websites you visit, and thus work out what your interests are.<br><br> 

Of course, cookies do not have to be malicious.<br><br>

For example, if we were to use cookies on our website (which we don't), we could identify which pages you visited most and perhaps increase the amount of information on those pages. Similarly, if we could tell how long (or how short!) you stayed on a page, we could modify the page to make it more interesting (or at least less boring!).<br><br>Similarly, cookies could enable us to identify which fonts were available on your hardware, and accordingly change the layout you see so as to suit your browser. <br><br>
And of course, to satisfy our massive egos, we could work out how many visitors we were getting each minute of the day, and marvel at our wonderful site, and their good taste.<br><br>
(Actually we once did that. At 3.54pm on the 18th October 2016 - our 49th birthday - we used StatCounter to take a snapshot of the number of people viewing the site at that very moment. You can still see that snapshot if you click on The ISA at the top of this page!).<br><br>  
It is widely estimated that 90% of all websites use cookies for one reason or another. We however do not.<br><br>

<b>Does the International Songwriters Association use any cookies?</b><br>
It is our policy that the International Songwriters Association does <b>not</b> utilise cookies for any purpose whatsoever.<br><br>
Accordingly, you can visit the International Songwriters Association site on the web at any time without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself, including your location, hardware model, IP address, other unique device identifiers, operating system version, browser type and settings, such as language and available font settings, and settings of the device you use to access the Services etc./b2
Neither do we track how often you visit, nor which pages you click on.<br><br>

However, the International Songwriters Association may embed content from, or link to, third-party websites and services, including social media platforms, video platforms etc, that are outside of our control. <br><br>While we encourage all sites to implement policies and practices that respect the privacy of vocotprs, obviously, the ISA is not responsible for the practices or the content of anybody else's site, nor are we responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by other websites or other services.

 <br><br>

<b>If I email International Songwriters Association, will you then store my name and/or contact information?</b><br>

The International Songwriters Association always tries to respond to queries from the general public (non-members) who request advice or assistance, or who simply wish to comment on songwriting in general.<br><br>   

In the case of these non-members of the International Songwriters Association, the ISA does not seek, gather or store any information (including e-mail addresses, IP addresses, telephone numbers, or postal addresses).<br><br>

Any information contained in, or which might be derived from such emails, telephone calls or letters as are sent to us by a non-member, is deleted once<br><br>

(a) a reply has been sent, or <br><br>

(b) any request contained in that communication has been acted upon, unless there is a continuing need to retain it for the purposes of ongoing correspondence. (For example, if you send us a query, and we require further information from you in order to answer that query, we may hold the original email or letter until such time as the extra information can be added to it.)<br><br>

Accordingly, every communication from a non-member which requires a follow-up response from the ISA, should be accompanied on each separate occasion by an email or postal address or telephone number, as the ISA will not have automatically gathered or stored such information from a previous communication. 
<br><br>

Naturally, if you are invited to become a member of the International Songwriters Association, then we will obviously need a name and some form of contact information (such as a postal or email address), and such information will obviously be stored by us. (See PRIVACY OF MEMBERS below for further information)<br><br>
