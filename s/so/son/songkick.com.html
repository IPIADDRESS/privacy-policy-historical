          <h1>Songkick Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p><em>TO OUR COMMUNITY: If this sort of thing interests you, we would like your feedback on this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. My hope is that we will make changes as your use of the new version of Songkick evolves over the coming months. Feel free to email me directly (<a href="mailto:pete@songkick.com">pete@songkick.com</a>) with any questions, criticisms and suggestions.</em></p>
            <p>-Pete Smith, COO/Co-founder</p>

            <p>Songkick knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the www.songkick.com website and domain name (collectively, the “Website”), and/or using any other linked pages, features, content, or application services offered from time to time by Songkick in connection therewith (collectively the “Service”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>1. WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy covers Songkick’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Songkick gathers when you access the Website and/or use some other features of the Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Songkick does not own or control, or to individuals that Songkick does not employ or manage.</p>

            <h2>2. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES SONGKICK COLLECT?</h2>
            <p>The information we gather enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>
            <h3>i. Personal Information You Provide to Us</h3>
            <p>We receive and store any information you enter on the Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, password and any other information necessary for us to provide the Service, including the usernames and passwords for your accounts and profiles on third-party sites with which the Service interoperates. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about Songkick’s products and services, including specials and new features.</p>
            <h3>ii. Personal Information Collected Automatically</h3>
            <p>a. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use another feature of our Service. Songkick automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.</p>
            <p>b. More generally, our Service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, or user music preference data, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Songkick only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or another feature of the Service so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve the Service. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Service. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Songkick never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>
            <h3>iii. E-mail Communications</h3>
            <p>We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Songkick if your computer supports this type of program. Songkick uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.</p>
            <h3>iv. The Songkicker</h3>
            <p>The Service includes a software component known as the Songkicker which enables Songkick to capture your musical tastes as demonstrated by the music you keep and listen to in your digital music collection. If you do install the Songkicker, it and the data it captures will operate and will be used by Songkick as follows:</p>
            <p>a. the Songkicker will be sending your music listening data (including a list of all songs and playlists in your digital music library) to the Songkick secure servers to be saved by Songkick in our databases</p>
            <p>b. your music listening data is also used to generate concert recommendations, as well as being used by Songkick to improve the Service for all Users, within the limits set by this Policy</p>

            <h2>3. WHAT ABOUT COOKIES?</h2>
            <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors. experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve quality.</p>
            <p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the Website’s most attractive features.</p>
            <p>Ads appearing on the Website or in other features of the Service may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Songkick and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

            <h2>4. WILL SONGKICK SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</h2>
            <p>Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below.</p>
            <h3>i. Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control</h3>
            <p>We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may sell items to you through the Website. In other situations, Songkick may provide services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.</p>
            <h3>ii. Agents</h3>
            <p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, Songkick’s agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.</p>
            <h3>iii. User profiles and other information you post</h3>
            <p>User profile information including users. name, email address, and other information you enter (“User Submissions”) may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Website. Email addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User Submissions. Users. email addresses will not be directly revealed to other users by Songkick, except, when the user is “connected” to another user via a shared group membership, or an invitation, or if the user has chosen to include their email address in their User Profile. Any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your display name may be displayed to other users when you upload images or videos or send messages through the Website and other users can contact you through messages and comments.

            <h3>iv. Communication in response to User Submissions</h3>
            <p>As part of the Service, you will receive from Songkick email and other communication relating to your User Submissions. You acknowledge and agree that by posting such User Submissions, Songkick may send you email and other communication that it determines in its sole discretion relate to your User Submissions.</p>
            <h3>v. Promotional Offers</h3>
            <p>We may send offers to you on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address. All email controls that allow you to choose whether or not to receive these offers can be found in the Account Settings section of the Website.</p>
            <h3>vi. Business Transfers</h3>
            <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Songkick, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Songkick goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Songkick may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>
            <h3>vii. Protection of Songkick and Others</h3>
            <p>We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Songkick, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
            <h3>viii. With Your Consent</h3>
            <p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>

            <h2>5. IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</h2>

Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

            <h2>6. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?</h2>
            <p>Songkick allows you to access the following information about you for the purpose of viewing, and in certain situations, updating that information. This list will change as the Website changes.</p>

            <p>You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the “What Personal Information Can I Access” section above. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.</p>
