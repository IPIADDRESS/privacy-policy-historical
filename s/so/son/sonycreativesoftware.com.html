	<div>Last Update: July 2010</div><br><p>At Sony, we believe you have a right to know what type of information we may collect when you interact with us and our practices with respect to that information. The guidelines contained herein apply only to information collected by or for Sony Creative Software Inc. ("SCS"). This includes, among other things, websites operated by or for SCS ("Sites"). Websites which are linked to/from these Sites (including websites of other Sony affiliated companies, e.g., Sony Electronics Inc., Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Computer Entertainment America) and via banner ads may have different policies; therefore, please review the privacy policy notices on those websites for details.</p><br><p>While SCS does not generally require that you provide us with personally identifiable information (for example, in order to visit and use the SCS Sites), please note that in order to participate in some activities, it will be necessary for you to provide such information. If you choose not to provide it for those activities, you may not be able to participate in them.</p><br><h2>Notice to California Residents . Your California Privacy Rights:</h2><p>California resident, you have the right to receive: a) information identifying any third party company(ies) to whom SCS may have disclosed, within the previous calendar year, personal information pertaining to you and your family for that company's direct marketing purposes; and b) a description of the categories of personal information disclosed. To obtain such information, please <a href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/privacyinfo">send us a message</a>.</p><br><h2>Collection of Information:</h2><p><strong><em>SCS may ask you to provide Personal Information,</em></strong> meaning individually identifiable information, such as your email address, name, mailing address, telephone number, social security number, credit card number, or persistent identifier (such as a customer number held in a cookie) which is associated with individually identifiable information, to, among other things, enable you to participate in contests, chat rooms, on bulletin boards, to obtain product or service support, to fill out a registration, to download certain software or to order products and services. SCS may combine the information you provide with other information we may collect from you or your devices or from third parties so that we can more effectively tailor our Sites, services and offerings to you.</p><br><p><strong><em>SCS will not share the Personal Information you provide with any other parties, except</em></strong> (a) to other Sony "Affiliates" (i.e., (i) Sony Corporation, (ii) any company of which 50% or more of its outstanding shares are owned by Sony Corporation, directly or indirectly, and (iii) any company with the name  "SONY" as a part of its trade name) who may want to contact you about products, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you (SCS and such Affiliates being collectively referred to as "Sony"), (b) with your consent (see below), (c) as may be required by law or court order, (d) to persons or companies SCS engages to carry out or provide support for our products and services or for the operation of our Sites or our business (in connection with joint marketing arrangements, co-branded relationships, or otherwise), or (e) to appropriate third parties, including law enforcement or other government agencies, in connection with a criminal investigation, fraud prevention, or other legal action or if SCS reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to protect SCS, its customers, or the public. SCS may also provide data from transactions that it believes to be fraudulent to third parties that provide fraud prevention services to SCS and other merchants.</p><br><p><strong><em>Co-Branded Sites</em></strong>. When you visit or use a part of any website that is co-branded (i.e., including both Sony and non-Sony branding) or that is a part of a joint promotion involving SCS and one or more third parties (each a "Co-Branded Party"), you are providing and consenting to provide and are transmitting the Personal Information and other information collected, provided or obtained to SCS and to each of the Co-Branded Parties involved, without any other notice or further consent. Please note that we do not control any Co-Branded Parties' use or treatment of information you provide to them and you should consult each of their privacy policies or any separate Co-Branded privacy policy posted on or linked from the Co-Branded Site to determine your rights with respect to their use and treatment of your information. You will need to communicate with us and each Co-Branded Party directly, as applicable, if you decide you no longer wish to receive communications or if you wish to change any information you have supplied.</p><br><p><strong><em>Unless you instruct us otherwise,</em></strong> SCS may contact you to provide information about products, services, promotions, contests, or other activities or offerings that may be of interest to you. You can instruct us whether or not you wish to receive such information by checking or unchecking the box indicating your preference, as applicable, at the place where your information is collected. In addition, with each commercial email you receive from SCS or any of its business units, you will be given the opportunity to indicate if you do not wish to receive future commercial emails from SCS or the SCS business unit which sent it to you.</p><br><p><strong>To adjust your preferences related to Sony Creative Software products, click <a href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/mailprefs">here.</a></strong></p><br><p><strong><em>With your consent,</em></strong> SCS may share your Personal Information with third parties outside of the Sony group of companies who may want to contact you about products, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you. SCS will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either by an "opt-out" or "opt-in" method, or by other means (such as an email request). Each of these companies may have their own privacy policies. We do not control and are not responsible for these other parties, their privacy policies or their use or treatment of your Personal Information or other information. We and our Affiliates make no representation regarding how any third parties use, manage, store, treat or maintain your Personal Information or other information and you should therefore carefully review all such third parties' privacy policies. If you consent to receiving communications from any of these third parties, you will need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications. If you wish to withdraw your consent from any further sharing of your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes you may do so by clicking on the link provided above and providing the requested information.</p><br><p>For instructions on how to request changes to the Personal Information you have provided to SCS, please <a href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/privacyinfo">send us a message</a>, or write to us at:</p><br><p>Privacy Office<br>Sony Creative Software<br>8215 Greenway Blvd<br>Suite 400<br>Middleton, WI  53562</p><br><p><strong>System Information.</strong> We may collect your computers', network enabled devices', systems' and/or networks' IP addresses and message information for system administration, record keeping, capacity planning, volume and other operational reasons, as well as for advertising and royalty reporting as necessary in the conduct of our business. When you use our services, our systems may record this information, which may be stored with your registration, order or other information you provide to us. This may allow us, among other things, to determine which other websites linked you to us.</p><br><p>We collect and maintain Personal Information and/or other information about visitors to our Sites, devices and users of devices that access or use our services and Sites, as well as anyone who sends us information or communications, and recipients of our communications. Much of this information we may gather directly by asking (e.g., hobbies, interests, purchasing habits, music preferences, difficulties in using a particular feature), but we also use technology to collect anonymous information, for example, regarding the content you view through our Sites, products and services and the devices you use to connect to them. We use such information to, among other things, enhance and customize our Sites and services and the advertising and promotions we make available to attempt to create a better experience. We also aggregate information (meaning it does not identify any individual) to analyze trends and statistics to improve your online experiences, our Sites, services, and customer support. If you visit or use the Sites or have registered or provided us with Personal Information about yourself, it is likely that "cookies" allow us to identify you and associate you with your registration, your devices, your applicable Account, user name or ID, information and preferences. For a description of how we use  "cookies" see the section below entitled "Cookies."</p><br><p><strong>Device ID.</strong> Some of the applications used in connection with our products and services generate a device identification ("ID") value during installation or use. This is a number that serves to identify your computer or other device (e.g., for licensing purposes), and which contains no specific information about you, your device, or any files or other data on your system. Among other things, these ID values serve as an effective way to combat software piracy.</p><br><p><strong>Cookies.</strong> When you visit any of our Sites, advertisements appearing thereon, use one or more of our services, or receive emails from SCS, we may use technology commonly referred to as a  "cookie" which stores small bits of data on your computer. While actual "cookie" technology is currently among the most common, we may use a wide variety of technological tools, means and mechanisms (e.g., XML technology, clickstream data, etc.) to help us to customize your experience to better match your interests and preferences and otherwise improve and enhance the services we provide. We will use the term "cookie" to refer to any and or all of these tools, means and mechanisms, whether they are currently available and in use, developed or discovered in the future or otherwise. We use cookies in a variety of ways. For example, we use cookies to save your user ID, Account number or other information (so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit or use our services) and to help us keep count of your return visits to our Sites and, in some cases, to our advertisers' or partners' or co-branded websites, which helps us determine which services, promotions, features, content and functions users like best. In general, browsers or separately purchased software tools may allow you to erase cookies from your hard drive. You acknowledge and understand that erasing cookies may limit or restrict your ability to use any or all the features and functions of our Sites, Co-Branded Sites and services. We may also use technology to detect the absence or presence of any versions of software or software updates installed on your computer and to track and monitor content you are downloading, streaming, using or otherwise accessing. Any or all of these activities can occur periodically or when necessary, without any other specific notice to you. We may also use cookies to identify your computer each time we automatically update or attempt to update your software. Cookies allow us to transmit and arrange for automatic installation of updates, modifications and even full re-installations of software on your computer to address security, digital rights management, interoperability or performance issues or to enhance the range of features and functions available through our Sites. Any or all of these activities can occur periodically or when necessary, without any other specific notice to you.</p><br><p><strong>Third Party Ads and Personal Information.</strong> Without limiting or amending any other provisions or terms described in our Privacy Policy, you should be aware that on some of our Sites, we use third parties to post and serve advertisements. Some of these third parties (e.g., Google's AdSense) use their own cookies and/or other technology to collect information about you and your visit to our Site(s) and your use of our services. We do not always control the advertisements you may see and while these third parties do not collect Personal Information about you (such as name, address, telephone number or email), they may collect other data (e.g., 'context-related' information such as which browser is being used, which domain you came to our Sites from, and what time and which pages are being accessed on our Sites, and other websites you may visit before or after leaving our Sites) and system information such as IP addresses. If you would like more information about Google's AdSense — including whether and how this information may be used by Google, <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">click here</a>. Your continued use of our Sites and services will constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy and the data collection and advertising practices that apply when you use our services or visit our Sites.</p><br><p><strong>Research and Tracking Techniques.</strong> Web beacons, pixel tags, passive capture technologies or other technologies may be used by SCS, third parties we engage or third party application providers for purposes such as researching and tracking certain usage, site interaction, and other activities on our Sites, on certain network enabled devices, and in emails you receive from us. Information collected through these technologies is typically in an aggregate, non-personally identifiable form. However, in some cases, the information collected may include personally identifiable information provided by the user where it is deemed advantageous to collect such information for purposes such as improving the usability of our Sites, providing customer support, and enabling users to access third party content and applications.</p><br><h2>Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information</h2><p>Anonymous information about you, such as your hobbies, interests, purchases, music and viewing preferences, downloads, burns, transfers, page visits and other information related to your user activity may be collected, and in some cases aggregated, by SCS and/or third parties whose applications you may access through your devices. This data can then be used to, among other things, tailor promotions, advertising, and communications that may be relevant to you. Such anonymous information may also be shared with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, licensors, content rights holders and other third parties, for example, to inform them about demographics or content preferences of visitors to our Sites and users of our products, or to ensure proper royalty reporting.</p><br><h2>Security</h2><p>SCS takes reasonable commercial precautions in maintaining the security of your Personal Information and in preventing unauthorized access to it through the use of appropriate technology and internal procedures. However, SCS cannot and does not guarantee that unauthorized access will never occur or that any communications means will be uninterrupted, error free or not intercepted by others improperly and without authorization.</p><br><h2>Notice To/Regarding Children Under the Age of 13</h2><p>SCS believes that children using the Internet require special protection, and we urge parents or guardians to explain Internet safety to their children. Parents are urged to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content available on the SCS Sites and the Internet in general. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers to help create a safer environment for children.</p><br><p>If you are under 13 years of age, you should not provide any Personal Information (for example, your last name, home address or e-mail address) on these Sites without the knowledge and permission of your parent or guardian. If SCS learns that you are under 13 years of age, SCS will not maintain or use any Personal Information about you without the verifiable consent of your parent or guardian, except as allowed by law. This may mean that you will be unable to participate in some activities on the Sites without that verifiable consent. If a child under 13 years of age wishes to participate in any SCS Site activity, or wishes to take advantage of a product or service offering available to children, and to do so necessitates the furnishing of any of the child's Personal Information, please note the following:</p><br><p>(i) The name, address, telephone number, and email address of the operator collecting or maintaining Personal Information from children through these Sites are as follows:</p><br><p>Privacy Office<br>Sony Creative Software<br>8215 Greenway Blvd<br>Suite 400<br>Middleton, WI  53562<br><a href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/privacyinfo">send us a message</a></p><br><p>(ii) The types of Personal Information collected from children may include the name, email address, home address, telephone number and/or any other information reasonably necessary for the child to participate in a particular activity. This information may be collected directly and/or passively (e.g., through a Web server that automatically recognizes and stores information such as a visitor's IP address/domain name combination).</p><br><p>(iii) The information collected may be used for purposes such as fulfillment of a requested transaction, record keeping, marketing back to the child, or making it publicly available through a chat room or by other means.</p><br><p>(iv) Unless specific consent is obtained from the child's parent or guardian, the child's Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties who are not contractors hired to carry out the internal operations of the Sites, other than as may be required or permitted by law. We have required, or will require, such contractors to agree to use Personal Information of Site visitors only for the purposes of carrying out these operations and to keep such information confidential. A parent or guardian has the option of consenting to the collection and use of the child's Personal Information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties.</p><br><p>(v) SCS is prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity; and</p><br><p>(vi) A parent can review and request deletion of the child's Personal Information, can refuse to permit further collection or use of the child's information, and can revoke or limit consents previously given. For instructions on how to do so, please send an email to:</p><br><p>Privacy Office<br>Sony Creative Software<br>8215 Greenway Blvd<br>Suite 400<br>Middleton, WI  53562<br><a href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/privacyinfo">send us a message</a></p><br><p>Except as permitted by law, before any collection of a child's Personal Information takes place at a Site directed to children or where SCS is knowingly collecting children's Personal Information, the child will be asked to provide his/her parent's or guardian's e-mail address so that SCS can contact the child's parent or guardian. SCS will then send an email (the  "Initial Notification") to the parent/guardian indicating, among other things, the information that the child is requested to provide, the intended use(s) of the information and information on how the parent/guardian can, at their election, delete the child's information from SCS's database or records. Upon receipt of the Initial Notification, a parent or guardian may respond back to SCS to grant his/her consent or to deny consent in which case SCS will delete the parent/guardian's email address and any other Personal Information, if any, previously obtained for securing parental consent. Upon SCS's receipt of the parent/guardian consent, SCS will send a confirming email to the parent/guardian's email address or take such other action as may be required to verify the consent.</p><br><p>If SCS desires to use a child's information for purposes other than that for which the parent/guardian consent was previously given, SCS will not do so without first getting the parent/guardian consent.</p><br><h2>Consent to Processing:</h2><p>By providing any Personal Information to SCS, all persons, including without limitation persons in the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in the United States of America, and/or in territories or countries outside of the United States of America, and understand and acknowledge their consent, notwithstanding that some governmental authorities may consider the level of protection of such data in the United States not equivalent to that required within the European Union or any other jurisdiction.</p><br><h2>Consent to Assignment:</h2><p>By providing any Personal Information to SCS, you will be deemed to have consented to SCS's disclosure and transfer to, as well as the use by, (a) any party who acquires all or any portion of any SCS service or business unit, whether through merger, acquisition, assignment, or sale, of your Personal Information or other information about you that we have obtained and that is governed by this Privacy Policy and which is related to such service or business unit ; and (b) any party who acquires all or substantially all of the assets of SCS, whether through merger, acquisition, assignment or sale, of your Personal Information or other information about you that we have obtained and that is governed by this Privacy Policy.</p><br><h2>Your Communications:</h2><p>We may, but we do not have an obligation to, monitor your communications, such as messages, to, from, within or directly related to our services and Sites to ensure that our policies regarding use and our terms and conditions are being complied with and not being violated (e.g., no obscenity, defamation or abusive language, no content that may infringe rights), and we have the right to block, remove and/or report any such communications and activities as appropriate. We may keep records of users' messages and, among other things, the email addresses involved.</p><br><h2>Links to Other Websites:</h2><p>From time to time we may offer links to other websites from our Sites. Other websites may also reference, advertise, or link to our Sites. However, we do not endorse or sponsor other websites, are not responsible for the privacy policies, practices or the content of such websites, expressly disclaim any statements or assertions made on such websites, and deny all liability associated with your use of, and the content on, such other websites. You may arrive at one of these websites through clicking on a banner advertisement, as part of a co-branding arrangement, or simply by selecting a link on any of our Site pages. These websites might issue their own cookies or collect Personal Information, so please use caution when visiting an external website. You should also be aware we sometimes permit third parties to offer subscription and registration-based services on our services. We are not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties with respect to Personal Information or other information you may give them, and you should carefully read and understand the applicable privacy policy whenever you provide Personal Information to anyone.</p><br><h2>Policy Governs Use: Changes to Privacy Policy</h2><p>The terms of this Privacy Policy will govern the use of any information collected while it is in place. SCS reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, so please re-visit this page often. In case of any material change, we will change the "Last Update Date" in this Privacy Policy and/or post a notice on the Sites. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective as of the stated "Last Update Date" and your continued use of the sites on or after the "Last Update Date" will constitute acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.</p><br><h2>Questions:</h2><p>If you have any questions or comments about our Personal Information practices or about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to <a href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/privacyinfo">send us a message</a> or write us at:</p><br><p>Privacy Office<br>Sony Creative Software<br>8215 Greenway Blvd<br>Suite 400<br>Middleton, WI 53562</p><br><p>If you have questions regarding products or services, please click <a href="http://www.custcenter.com">here</a> for further information.</p><br>
