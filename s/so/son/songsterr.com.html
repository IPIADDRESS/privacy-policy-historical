<h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>

This data collection is used to assist us in managing the website, track the usage and improve our services. This non-personal identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members.</p>

<p>Email addresses are used on the site for the purposes of sending updates, newsletters or general news regarding the website services.

<h2>Your Financial Information</h2>

<p>Songsterr.com is designed to provide a safe and secure environment for making payments. When you subscribe to Songsterr Plus account, our systems redirects your browser software on your computer to establish a secure, encrypted connection using an Internet-standard technology called SSL with a third-party payment processing system. This encrypted connection prevents information from being intercepted as it travels the Internet between our systems. You can verify that you are viewing a secure web page by checking your browser’s lock icon — on a secure page the lock will appear in the “locked” position.</p><p>

</p><p>Your credit card information is sent through a secure connection to third-party credit card processor directly and is never retained on our servers.</p>

<p>If for any reason these systems fail and unauthorized charges are made to your account, the Fair Credit Billing Act stipulates that your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. This protection applies only to credit cards (not debit cards) issued under the laws of the United States of America. Credit cards issued in other countries may afford similar protection.</p>
