              <strong><u>Notice</u></strong><br>
              <br>
              This Web site is operated by Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. and/or 
              its subsidiary companies in the United States of America (collectively, 
              “SPE”). This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) 
              applies to information that you provide to SPE via this site, and/or 
              by use of other services (collectively, the “Services”) 
              that may be provided by other means or media, including as set forth 
              below and as defined in the applicable Terms of Service or other 
              terms. <br>
              <br>
            This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you notice of SPE’s 
            information management practices, including the types of information 
            gathered, how it is used and safeguarded, and the degree to which 
            you may control the maintenance and sharing of your information. Your 
            use of any SPE Service or Web site constitutes acceptance of this 
            Privacy Policy and any other applicable terms. The <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/corp/tos.html" target="_blank">Terms 
            of Service</a> for this Web site are hereby incorporated by reference. 
            <br>
              <br>
              <strong><u>Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect</u></strong><br>
              <br>
              SPE respects your privacy and is committed to protecting personally 
              identifiable information that you provide in connection with your 
              use of its Web sites and Services. <br>
              <br>
              <u>E-mail Newsletter Subscriptions</u><br>
              <br>
              To subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, you will need to provide 
              your e-mail address. You may also be asked for other information 
              when you subscribe. <br>
              <br>
              <u>User Accounts</u><br>
              <br>
              In order to use our chat rooms, message boards, and certain other 
              Services, you will need to register and create a user account ("User 
              Account"). There is no cost to create a User Account in most cases. 
              You may be asked to choose a user name, screen name, or member name 
              (each, a "User Name") and password. Please do not use your real 
              name or the real name of another person when selecting a User Name. 
              You will also be asked to provide certain personally identifiable 
              information and other information about yourself, such as your first 
              and last name, date of birth, address, telephone number, and e-mail 
              address.<br>
              <br>
              Please note that your User Name will be available to the Internet's 
              general public while you participate in some Services, like chat 
              rooms or message boards, so you should exercise discretion when 
              using these Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any 
              information you may disclose publicly in such Services. In some 
              instances, you may choose to create a "Public Profile" that will 
              be available to others on the Internet. Public Profiles are managed 
              entirely by you, and you are solely responsible for your Public 
              Profile's content and its "public" or "private" status. You are 
              also responsible for maintaining and updating the registration information 
              in your User Account with current and complete information. You 
              may access, edit or remove your Public Profile by signing in to 
              your User Account and following the directions there. You can also 
              send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:SonyPrivacy@sonypictures.com">SonyPrivacy@sonypictures.com</a> 
              to request deactivation of your User Account. <br>
              <br>
            <u><strong><u><a name="pii" id="pii"></a></u></strong>Special Promotions 
            and Purchases</u><br>
              <br>
            To participate in some Services such as sweepstakes, contests and 
            surveys ("Special Promotions"), or to make online purchases ("Purchases"), 
            you will need to provide personally identifiable information, such as name, mailing 
            address, e-mail address, phone number, and date of birth. Your information 
            may be collected by SPE or by a third party, such as a co-sponsor 
            or a vendor involved in, or providing services in connection with, 
            a Special Promotion, or an e-commerce partner in the case of a Purchase 
            (e.g., www.SonyStyle.com or www.yahoo.com).<br>
              <br>
              If you make a Purchase or enter a sweepstakes or other Special Promotion 
              on one of our sites or through our Services, SPE will collect your 
              personally identifiable information, and you are deemed to consent 
              to us providing your information to third parties who provide certain 
              services such as processing of credit card transactions, customer 
              service, promotion or sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment 
              and/or prize delivery, as applicable. (As more fully described below 
              in <a href="#disclosure">Use, Disclosure, and Sharing of Information</a> 
              - Personally Identifiable Information, these third parties are prohibited 
              from using this information for their own marketing purposes and/or 
              from sharing, selling, or otherwise distributing any personal data 
              of our customers, unless you choose to opt in for such additional 
              uses and/or disclosure by the third parties, under their respective 
              privacy policies.)<br>
              <br>
              If you make a purchase or enter a promotion (such as a sweepstakes) 
              in which SPE is participating on a third party's Web site (or through 
              some other means or medium), we will collect your information from 
              the third party only if you opt-in to receive additional communications 
              from us, or we are required to fulfill some function in relation 
              to your activity (e.g., to send your order or deliver a prize). 
              <br>
              <br>
              <u>Information Collected by Other Means or Media</u><br>
              <br>
            In some situations, we may also collect personally identifiable information 
            and other information about you through other means, directly or indirectly. 
            For example, if you access any SPE content, or purchase such content 
            via your wireless carrier or through another third party, SPE may 
            collect information directly from you or through the third party. 
            Likewise, if you use our software, or provide information to other 
            companies who share information about their customers, we may collect 
            additional information about you. In each of these cases, SPE will 
            apply this policy to any personally identifiable information. <br>
              <br>
              <u>Information About Other People</u><br>
              <br>
            Some SPE sites and Services may ask you to submit personally identifiable 
            information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's 
            name and other personally identifiable information if you purchase 
            a gift and want to have it sent directly to the recipient. A record 
            of that transaction will be maintained as allowed and/or required 
            by law. <br>
              <br>
              <u>Customer Service</u><br>
              <br>
              Some Services may offer support and technical assistance through 
              customer service centers via telephone, online chat, or e-mail. 
              Whenever you communicate with customer service, you do so with the 
              understanding that an operator may view and make changes to the 
              information in your User Account in order to provide the assistance 
              that you need. <br>
              <br>
              <strong><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect</u></strong><br>
              <br>
              As part of the registration process for some Services, you may be 
              asked to provide information that does not personally identify you. 
              For example, you may be asked to provide information concerning 
              your film, music or other entertainment preferences, purchasing 
              habits, and the like. This information is generally optional but 
              may be included in your User Account profile. SPE requests this 
              information to understand you better and to also bring to your attention 
              new services, programs, or offers that may be of interest to you. 
              <br>
              <br>
              In many cases, SPE will automatically collect certain non-personally 
              identifiable information about your use of its sites and Services. 
              SPE might collect, among other things, information concerning the 
              type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, 
              the domain name of your Internet service provider, your "click path" 
              through the SPE sites or "click-through" from an e-mail, the Web 
              site or advertisement that was linked to or from the SPE site when 
              you visited, and your IP address. To do this, SPE may use cookies 
              and other technology (see below). If you are using our wireless 
              Services, we may also automatically collect information such as 
              the type of wireless device you are using, your mobile identification 
              number (assigned by your telecommunications carrier) and telecommunications 
              carrier. Your use of our Web sites and Services, and information 
              provided through these technologies, will be anonymous unless you 
              provide us with personally identifiable information or have provided 
              such information in the past. <br>
              <br>
              <strong><u>Cookies and Related Technology</u></strong> <br>
              <br>
              SPE Web sites, and some Services and advertisements may contain 
              "cookies," clear gifs (also known as web beacons or web bugs), or 
              similar technology. A cookie is a piece of data that is sent to 
              your Internet browser, which will store the cookie on your computer 
              if your browser is enabled to accept cookies. Web beacons assist 
              in the delivery of cookies and the collection of non-personally 
              identifiable information, such as "click path" and other data as 
              described above. <br>
              <br>
              SPE uses cookies, clear gifs, frames, server log analysis and other 
              technologies as they are developed to customize your experience 
              with our sites and Services. <br>
              <br>
              Most Internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your 
              computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning 
              before a cookie is stored. You should refer to your browser instructions 
              or "Help" screen to learn more about how to manage cookies. Please 
              note, however, that if you block cookies, some portions of the SPE 
              Web sites and Services may not function properly. <br>
              <br>
              SPE does not control cookies in third party ads, and visitors are 
              encouraged to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad 
              services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology. 
              The ads appearing on our Web sites may be delivered to you by third-party 
              advertising companies. SPE's Privacy Policy does not cover the use 
              of information collected from you by third party ad servers. These 
              companies may use information (not including your name, address, 
              e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this and 
              other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site 
              and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest 
              to you. If you would like more information about this practice and 
              to know your choices about not having this information used by these

            <strong><u>Special Notice Regarding Children Under 13</u></strong> 
            <br>
              <br>
              SPE recognizes the sensitivity of personally identifiable information 
              concerning children under the age of 13 and therefore provides this 
              special notice. SPE is committed to complying with all applicable 
              laws and regulations regarding children, including the Children's 
              Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Except in limited circumstances 
              allowed by COPPA, SPE will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose 
              any personally identifiable information from a child under 13 without 
              first obtaining consent from that child's parent or legal guardian. 
              <br>
              <br>
              If you are the parent or guardian of a child under 13, and your 
              child would like to participate in certain Services for which COPPA 
              requires your consent (and SPE has chosen to make such Services 
              available to children in this age group), your child will be prompted 
              to print out a form for you to complete and mail in to SPE. The 
              form will list the information required from both parent/guardian 
              and child, as well as the intended uses of the information. SPE 
              will only collect information that is reasonably necessary for your 
              child to participate, and SPE will not share your child's personally 
              identifiable information with any third party (except for purposes 
              of fulfillment by a third party that has agreed to protect the information 
              in accordance with this Privacy Policy), unless you specifically 
              consent, or as permitted by COPPA or other applicable law. You may 
              also subsequently revoke your consent and request that your child's 
              information be removed from SPE's active list. Please refer to the 
              form for instructions and further information. <br>
              <br>
              If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child 
              under the age of 13 has submitted his or her personally identifiable 
              information without your permission or consent, SPE will make reasonable 
              efforts to remove the information from its active list, at your 
              request. To request the removal of your child's information, please 
              send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:SonyPrivacy@sonypictures.com" target="_blank">SonyPrivacy@sonypictures.com</a> 
              and be sure to include in your message the same User Name and password 
              and/or e-mail address that your child submitted. <br>
              <br>
              SPE encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their 
              children to become familiar with the types of content available 
              on the SPE Web sites and the Internet generally.<br>
              <br>
              <strong><u><a name="disclosure"></a>Use, Disclosure, and Sharing 
              of Information</u></strong> <br>
              <br>
              <u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</u><br>
              <br>
            From time to time, SPE may use and share with third parties aggregate, 
            non-personally identifiable user information to show general demographic 
            and preference information among users of the SPE Web sites. <br>
              <br>
            <u><strong></strong>Personally Identifiable Information</u><br>
              <br>
              SPE uses information about you to deliver the Services that you 
              request, to keep you informed about changes affecting our Services 
              or your account, to inform you of other Services or offers in which 
              you might be interested, and to improve and enhance our sites and 
              Services. If you provide SPE with personally identifiable information, 
              we will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect it 
              from unauthorized disclosure. <br>
              <br>
              If you opt in to receive e-mail from us, you can always opt out 
              of future marketing messages by following the directions in each 
              message to "unsubscribe." However, if you choose to opt out of marketing 
              messages, we reserve the right to contact you regarding your account 
              status, technical support, product information, changes to account 
              terms, and any other matter that might affect our service to you 
              and/or any products you purchased from us or registered with us, 
              as applicable. <br>
              <br>
              As stated in the Terms of Service, you will be deemed to have consented 
              to the disclosure to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator 
              of a SPE Web site or Service, of any information about you contained 
              in the applicable SPE database, if SPE or one of its companies assigns 
              its rights and obligations regarding any of your information at 
              the time of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially 
              all of SPE's or such SPE company's assets related to the applicable 
              site or Service to a subsequent owner or operator. In the event 
              of such a merger, acquisition, or sale, your continued use of the 
              site or any related Service signifies your agreement to be bound 
              by the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of the site's or Service's

              <br>
              The SPE companies may work together in order to provide portions 
              of the SPE sites and some Services (e.g., to fulfill prizes won 
              in a sweepstakes, or to provide other support for a Service). These 
              companies will handle your personally identifiable information in 
              accordance with this Privacy Policy. <br>
              <br>
            As stated above in <a href="#pii"><strong>Personally Identifiable 
            Information That We Collect</strong> - Special Promotions and Purchases</a>, 
            SPE may also work with third parties to provide some Services on our 
            sites. In connection with those Services, you are deemed to consent 
            to us sharing your information with third parties who provide services 
            such as processing of credit card transactions, customer service, 
            promotion administration, order fulfillment and/or prize delivery, 
            as applicable. Third parties who provide, or participate in, Services 
            on SPE sites are prohibited from using our customers' personally identifiable 
            information for marketing purposes and/or from sharing, selling, or 
            otherwise using such information, unless you choose to opt in to marketing, 
            sharing, or other uses by the third parties. <strong>If you do not 
            want your information to be used for marketing (or other purposes 
            unrelated to the provision of SPE Services) by a third party who participates 
            in a Service on one of our sites, do not opt in to such use by that 
            third party when you register to participate in the Service.</strong> 
            <br>
              <br>
              Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications 
              from a third party, your information will be subject to the third 
              party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want 
              that third party to use your information, you will need to contact 
              the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties 
              use information. You should always review the privacy policy of 
              any party that collects your information to determine how that entity 
              will handle your information.<br>
              <br>
              SPE will not share, sell, rent, or disclose any personally identifiable 
              information that we have collected except as stated herein, or in 
              the following instances: 1) we have been given your consent to disclose; 
              2) we have previously informed you of the disclosure, including 
              by means of our Privacy Policy or on the Web site, or through the 
              Service where you provided your information; 3) we are required 
              by law, legal process, or court order to disclose; 4) disclosure 
              is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against 
              someone who may cause or be causing harm to, or interference with, 
              SPE's rights or property, other SPE Web site users, or anyone else; 
              or 5) to respond to an inquiry, request or complaint that you have 
              made. SPE may also use IP addresses in cooperation with Internet 
              service providers to identify users if we deem it necessary to comply 
              with law, to enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy or our 
              Terms of Service, or to protect our sites, customers, or others.<br>
              <br>
              <strong><u>Our Commitment to Data Security</u></strong> <br>
              <br>
              While SPE takes reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect 
              your personally identifiable information from unauthorized disclosure 
              and to prevent possible security breaches in our Web sites, Services, 
              and customer databases, no Web site, Internet transmission, computer 
              system, or wireless connection is completely secure. Consequently, 
              SPE cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, 
              or other breaches will never occur. Your use of the SPE sites and 
              Services is at your own risk. SPE urges you to take steps to keep 
              your information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it 
              in a safe place (separate from your account information), logging 
              out of your User Account, and closing your Web browser. <br>
              <br>
              Whenever you give SPE sensitive or confidential information (for 
              example, credit card numbers for Purchases), SPE will take commercially 
              reasonable steps to protect the information by establishing a secure 
              connection with your Web browser. SPE employs a security technology 
              known as a secure-socket-layer ("SSL") to protect the transmission 
              of payment information to the site. Unless otherwise specified herein 
              or on the site where you make a Purchase, credit card numbers are 
              used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing 
              purposes.<br>
              <br>
              <strong><u>Hyperlinks To and From Other Sites</u></strong> <br>
              <br>
              SPE sites may frame, and/or contain links to, or advertisements 
              about, non-SPE Web sites. Other sites may also reference, advertise, 
              or link to SPE sites. SPE does not endorse or sponsor other Web 
              sites, is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content 
              of non-SPE sites, expressly disclaims any statements or assertions 
              made on such Web sites, and denies all liability associated with 
              your use of, and the content on, such other sites and advertisements.

              <strong><u>Consent to Processing in the United States</u></strong> 
              <br>
              <br>
              By providing any personally identifiable information to SPE, all 
              users, including, without limitation, users in the member states 
              of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent 
              to this Privacy Policy and to the collection, storage, and processing 
              of such information in the United States of America. <br>

              SPE reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy and its Terms 
              of Service at any time. In case of any material change to the Privacy 
              Policy, we will replace the "Privacy Policy" link on the home page 
              of our sites with a link entitled "Updated Privacy Policy" for no 
              less than 30 days. All changes to the Privacy Policy and/or Terms 
              of Service will be effective when posted, and your continued use 
              of any SPE site or Service after the posting will constitute acceptance 
              of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.<br>
