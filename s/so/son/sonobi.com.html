<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have carried out a balancing test and we believe that we have a legitimate business interest to use and share your personal data (in compliance with this privacy policy and subject to your various rights as set out in this privacy policy) and that our legitimate interest is not detrimental to you.</span></p>
