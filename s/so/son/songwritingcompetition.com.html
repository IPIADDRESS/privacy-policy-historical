<p>ISC reserves the right to extend the deadline and/or add special promotions within or after the deadlines.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="5"><p class="subhead">Does my song have to be an original song?</p></a><p>Yes, ISC only accepts original songs. So, songs that were written by someone else or a long time ago (in public domain) may not be considered original, even if they are rearranged. We do, however, accept songs that include some sampling of other songs (if used as background or filler) and parodies of songs (in the Comedy/Novelty category). Please do not send public domain songs that you have written lyrics to or rearranged (unless it's in the Comedy/Novelty category).</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="6"><p class="subhead">Can I enter my song(s) from a country other than the USA?</p></a><p>Yes, ISC accepts and welcomes entries from all over the world. ISC is one of the largest songwriting and music contests in the world and receives entries from over 140 countries.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="7"><p class="subhead">What are my chances of winning if I live outside the USA?</p></a><p>ISC has the most international winners of any major songwriting or music contest. Approximately 60% of our winners are from outside the US.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="8"><p class="subhead">Are there any age requirements to enter?</p></a><p>Anyone of any age can enter ISC, except the Teen category which requires the entrant to be <strong>18 years old or younger on or before December 31, 2018</strong>.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="9"><p class="subhead">How many songs can I enter?</p></a><p>There is no limit to the number of songs you may enter into the songwriting contest.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="10"><p class="subhead">How many categories can I enter my song(s) into?</p></a><p>You may enter as many songs as you want in different categories, or you may even enter as many songs as you want in the same category.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="45"><p class="subhead">Am I allowed to enter if I'm a past winner?</p></a><p>Yes, ISC welcomes your entry.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="11"><p class="subhead">What if my song does not fit exactly into a category?</p></a><p>Enter it into the category that it fits best in. A great song will stand out and be recognized even if it does not fit exactly into a specific category. The categories are a guide, not a rule. Please do not email us and ask us to pick a category for you. You know your songs better than we do, and it needs to be your decision.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="12"><p class="subhead">Can I have another vocalist sing the song I wrote?</p></a><p>Yes, any vocalist can sing the song; it doesn't need to be the song author. Also, you may use any musicians you wish.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="13"><p class="subhead">What does AAA signify?</p></a><p>AAA stands for Triple A (Adult Album Alternative), which is a radio format. AAA playlists are much broader than the limited playlists of hit radio, and therefore depend on album tracks as well as on music released as singles. Stylistically, such stations may play rock, folk-rock, country-rock, modern rock, singer/songwriter, and blues music. Examples of artists in the AAA category include: Jewel, John Mayer, Fleetwood Mac, Jason Mraz, Ben Harper, Beck, The Jayhawks, Pete Yorn, Tori Amos, Coldplay, Train, etc.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="14"><p class="subhead">What is Americana music?</p></a><p>Americana music is best described as progressive, roots country music, which offers an alternative to mainstream country. Examples of Americana artists include Gillian Welch, Joe Ely, Johnny Cash, Steve Earle, Lyle Lovett, Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson, John Hiatt, Ryan Adams, etc.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="15"><p class="subhead">What is the Performance category?</p></a><p>This category is judged not only on songwriting but also on the overall performance and delivery of the song. This makes ISC a music competition as well as a songwriting competition! The criteria include vocal delivery (unless it is an instrumental and has no vocals), instrumentation, melody, arrangement, lyrics, creativity, and overall likeability. This category will be judged on the total package – the overall quality of the song and the performance of it. All genres of music are accepted for this category.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="2"><p class="subhead">What is the Unsigned Only category?</p></a><p><strong>If you enter a song into the Unsigned Only category, you must also enter the same song into at least one other category. Please note that there is an additional fee for the second category (it is considered to be two entries).&nbsp;</strong>This category is open to anyone who is not signed to a major label record company (Sony BMG, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, EMI, or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, or imprints. Additionally, entrants may not have a distribution deal with any of the aforementioned. Entrants who are on independent labels or release their own material without a label (or have never released any material) are eligible to enter this category. Entrants may enter songs of any genre into this category. As with all ISC categories, Unsigned Only entries are eligible for the Grand Prize. Entrants are also eligible to enter all other categories. The main difference between this category and all the others is that all other categories are open to signed and unsigned artists whereas the Unsigned Only category is open to unsigned artists only.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="16"><p class="subhead">Does ISC accept Spoken Word songs?</p></a><p>Yes, ...since ISC does not have a specific category for Spoken word, it is recommended to enter Spoken Word songs into the Performance category.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="3"><p class="subhead">What are the rules for entering a music video?</p></a><p>All videos must be original songs and cannot exceed more than 10 minutes in length. ISC accepts DVDs, but not the PAL format. You can mail your video, along with an entry form, or you can upload them by entering online. Instead of mailing a DVD, you can give us a link to your video, and we'll watch it online. Whether it's YouTube, Vimeo, your website, or some other website - we'll go to the site and view it. All you have to do is write down the website link on the entry form. This makes it very easy.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="17"><p class="subhead">What kind of jazz songs does ISC accept?</p></a><p>ISC accepts both instrumental jazz and jazz with vocals – everything from traditional jazz to avant-garde, standards to smooth jazz, swing, and more.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="18"><p class="subhead">Do you accept parodies in the Comedy/Novelty category?</p></a><p>Yes, we do (but make them funny!)...</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="43"><p class="subhead">Do you accept stand-up comedy routines (without songs or music)?</p></a><p>Yes!</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="19"><p class="subhead">Is there a maximum time length to an entered song?</p></a><p>No, you may enter songs of any time length.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="20"><p class="subhead">How much does it cost to enter?</p></a><p>The current entry is $25 per song or category. For example, if you enter one song in one category the fee is $25. If you enter one song in two categories, the fee is $50. If you enter two songs in one category the fee is $50. If you enter one song in three categories, the fee is $75. As you can see, each time you add a song or category, you will have to add $25.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="21"><p class="subhead">Will ISC notify entrants that their entry has been received? </p></a><p>ISC sends out an email to all entrants notifying them that their entry has been received. However, as you know, email is not always 100% reliable, and sometimes is not received. This can happen for a variety of reasons: the email might be filtered out by a spam program (so check your junk mailbox), your server might be down, etc., etc. If your email address changes, please be sure to notify us, as email is the primary method ISC uses to communicate with entrants.<span> </span>If you do not receive any notification from ISC within a few weeks of sending out your entry, feel free to contact the ISC office at 615.251.4441 to verify receipt.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="22"><p class="subhead">How and when will winners be notified?</p></a><p>All entrants will receive notification of the semi-finalists, finalists, and winners via email. Winners will be emailed and/or phoned. Please do not call the ISC office to inquire about winners as it will slow down the process. If you do not receive an email, please check the website for updated information.&nbsp; 2018 Semi-finalists and Finalists will be announced in February-March of 2019, and winners in April of 2019.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="23"><p class="subhead">Does ISC give feedback?</p></a><p>ISC does not give feedback or a critique to entrants. Please do not ask for this service.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="24"><p class="subhead">Does ISC notify entrants about the status of their entry during the process?</p></a><p>ISC will not be notifying any artists as to the judging status of their entry. In the past, ISC notified entrants if they made it to the next round. Unfortunately, due to confusion caused by this process, ISC no longer will be doing this.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="25"><p class="subhead">What are the requirements for eligibility for the Teen category?</p></a><p>The only requirement is that all entrants in the Teen category must be 18 yrs. old or younger by December 31, 2019. If there are multiple songwriters, they must all adhere to this age requirement. Entrants may be from any country. Please be sure to have your parent or guardian sign the entry form and also put your date of birth(s) on the entry form! Please note that in order to attend Berklee College of Music's 5-Week Summer Performance Program (one of the prizes for the First Place winner of the Teen category), the winner must be at least 15 years old when attending.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="26"><p class="subhead">What kind of music can I enter into the Teen category?</p></a><p>You<span><strong> </strong></span>may enter <em>any</em> kind of music (for example: rock, pop, folk, blues, jazz, country, instrumental, etc). You do not need to specify the genre of music on your application.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="27"><p class="subhead">If I entered last year, can I enter again this year?</p></a><p>Yes, and you can enter either the same song(s) or new songs. Since we have many new judges this year, it will be "new ears" listening to your entries. We have had numerous instances where entrants have entered the same song from year to year with different outcomes.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="28"><p class="subhead">Am I allowed to enter songs that have been entered into other songwriting competitions?</p></a><p>Yes, we welcome all songs, even if they have been entered (whether they won or not) into other songwriting competitions.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="29"><p class="subhead">Do you have any specific instructions for a mail-in entry?</p></a><p>Please put all your songs on one CD. It is more affordable for you and easier for us. Please make sure the names of the songs are clearly marked on the CD. If you are sending a CDR, please put a piece of masking tape on the spine of the case and write your name in black magic marker. Use a regular-sized case, not an ultra-thin one. Use the same procedure if you are sending in a video. Also, please make sure that the entrant's name is clearly marked directly on the CD, CDR, or video. Finally, it will help us if you insert a track listing into the CD case.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="30"><p class="subhead">Do I have to enter recorded music or can I just enter sheet music?</p></a><p>It is necessary to enter recorded music except for the Lyrics Only category which is judged solely on the lyrics, no music. The Lyrics Only category is one of ISC's most popular category, making ISC one of the most prominant lyric songwriting contests in the world.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="31"><p class="subhead">How do I enter lyrics only?</p></a><p>Please send in two copies of the lyrics typed or neatly written. They do not need to be accompanied by music, but if you prefer, you may also send in the song on CD. Do not include sheet music, chords, or any other kind of musical notation - only the lyrics. If the lyrics are in a language other than English, please include the English translation, if available. You do not need to specify the kind of music the lyrics are written for, but if you want to, that's fine with us. It will not affect the judging process in any way.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="32"><p class="subhead">Does ISC own my song once I have entered it?</p></a><p>No, absolutely not. The entrant retains ALL rights to the songs, and ISC does NOT own the song or any rights to it.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="33"><p class="subhead">May I enter a song that I wrote if the rights to it are owned by a publishing company?</p></a><p>Yes, you may enter all categories except for the Unpublished category which requires that the songwriter(s) own their own publishing rights.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="34"><p class="subhead">May I enter a song that has been released before on a CD?</p></a><p>Yes, of course, as long as you own the rights to the song, or can get permission from the copyright owner.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="35"><p class="subhead">May I shop a song to a record label or publishing company that has been entered into ISC?</p></a><p>Yes, of course. Since ISC has no ownership in any song entered, you may continue to do business as usual with any song entered into ISC. In fact, we encourage you to be proactive and do whatever you can to gain success with your songs.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="36"><p class="subhead">If I am entering from outside the US, what type of payment do you accept?</p></a><p>We cannot accept a personal check if your bank is from outside the USA.

It is completely separate from the regular winners that are selected by ISC judges. Once ISC announces the finalists, their songs are put up on the website for a month, and the public is invited to vote for their favorite song.<span> </span>The finalist who receives the most votes wins a lot of great prizes, recognition, and kudos! Please note: Voting is allowed once a day from an unique email address. ISC will closely monitor the voting and will reserve the right to disqualify anyone who creates fake email addresses, buys votes, or in any way attempts to fraudulently submit votes. We expect voters to be honorable!</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="41"><p class="subhead">Do the judges listen to all the entries, or is there a screening process?</p></a><p>There is a screening committee that listens to all entries and selects the group of finalists which are then sent to the judges. The judges then select the winners from this group of finalists. The screening committee is comprised of ISC staff who are all qualified music business professionals with extensive experience in songwriting and music. ISC does not utilize any outside screeners. The screening process is carefully and respectfully implemented with the goal of selecting the best songs to send on to the judges.</p> <p>(<a href="faq#top">back to top</a>)</p><br><a name="42"><p class="subhead">How long has ISC been in existence?</p></a><p>This is the 18th year for ISC.

All platforms accept credit cards and PayPal for payment. No matter which platform you enter, your songs are given the same amount of consideration in the competition.
