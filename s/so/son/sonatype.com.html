<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p><br><br><br><br></p>
<h2>1.  Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>Sonatype, Inc. ("Sonatype" or "us" or "we") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information that you provide to us. This Privacy Policy governs your use of our websites and all related forums, documentation and other services you access through the websites (the "Service").  However, if you download software or purchase training, support, subscriptions or other services or products from us, those products and services are governed by the separate license or purchase terms made available in connection with such products or services.</p>
<p>This statement explains our policies and practices regarding the use and disclosure of your personal information by Sonatype. Please note that Sonatype reviews and updates this Privacy Policy from time to time as needed without notice. Therefore, you should review the terms of this policy periodically to make sure that you are aware of how Sonatype collects and uses personal information. By using our Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information by Sonatype as explained below.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>2.  Personal Information</h2>
<p>You have complete control over your personal information. In general, you can use our Service without providing us with any personal information. However, there are instances where we must have your personal information in order for us to grant you access to our Service or to assist us in delivering a superior level of customer service. This information may include registration data (your name, company, address, email address, phone number, title, etc.), information request data and response data ("User Information").</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>3.  Use of User Information</h2>
<p>We intend to use such information for purposes of supporting your and your employer's relationship with Sonatype by providing a Service that is suitable to your needs and alerting you to new product and service offerings as they become available. This User Information may be retained by Sonatype to verify compliance with the agreement between Sonatype and your employer, to keep track of the domains from which people visit us, to create a user profile to better serve you and your employer, or to simply contact you either electronically or otherwise. If you decide that we should not use your personal User Information to contact you, please let us know and we will not use that information for such purpose.  However, do not submit any User Information if you are less than 18 years of age.  We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we know is under the age of 13.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>4.  Monitoring</h2>
<p>Although we are not obligated to do so, we may review your communications with respect to the Service to determine whether you comply with our Terms of Service.  Sonatype will not have any liability or responsibility for the content of any communications you provide, or for any errors or violations of any laws or regulations by you.</p>
<p>  </p>
<h2>5.  Disclosure of User Information</h2>
<p>Sonatype does not sell, trade or transfer User Information to third parties. However, we may share User Information with our business partners for marketing, advertising or product/service offering purposes. For example, we provide User Information to our service providers for direct emailing of our newsletters, online surveys or notifications on Sonatype Offerings (as defined below) to our viewers. We may share with third parties aggregated, non-personal information.  Such information does not identify you individually. We also disclose User Information if: we have your consent; we need to share it in order to provide you with the products and/or services you requested; we respond to a court order; you violate our Terms of Service or we otherwise suspect that you are engaged in fraudulent or illegal activities. You may separately agree to provide your personal information to third parties that provide content for Sonatype Offerings, in order to access and/or use their products and/or services. If you agree to provide such information to these third parties, then your personal information will be subject to their privacy policies.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>6.  Accuracy and Security</h2>
<p>The accuracy and security of User Information is important to Sonatype. If you contact us to correct your User Information, we will attempt to correct such inaccuracies in a timely manner. Sonatype is concerned with the security of your User Information and is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect it from unauthorized access and use of that personal information. To that end, we put in place the appropriate physical, electronic and managerial policies and procedures intended to help secure your personal User Information. We do not store credit card information. We also continue to implement procedures to maintain accurate, complete and current User Information. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is one hundred percent secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>7.  Usernames and Passwords</h2>
<p>Access to certain content on our Service may be allowed under a written agreement between you or your employer, and Sonatype and will require a username and/or password. In some cases, failure to provide personal information may prevent you from accessing certain Sonatype web site(s) containing certain confidential information, products, services, or promotional offers ("Sonatype Offerings"). By accessing and using our protected and secured web site(s), you agree to maintain the confidentiality of the username and password you selected to access such site(s) and consent to our Terms of Service.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>8.  Cookies</h2>
<p>We use "cookies." A cookie is a small data file that a web site can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to keep records of the visits to such site. A cookie contains information such as your username and password that helps us recognize the pages you have visited and improve future visits, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is the information that you provide yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive or read cookie files created by other sites. Information stored in cookies may be encrypted, however, we do not store your credit card number in cookies. If you prefer not to accept a cookie, you can set your web browser to warn you before accepting cookies, or you can refuse all cookies by turning them off in your web browser. If, however, you prefer not to enable cookies, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please note that certain features of our Service may not be available once cookies are disabled.</p>
