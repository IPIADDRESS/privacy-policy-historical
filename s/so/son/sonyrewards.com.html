<br>
</p><p>At Sony Electronics Inc. we believe our online visitors have a right
to know what information we collect when you visit our Websites. The guidelines
contained here apply only to your visit to the Websites for our U.S. electronics
operations. If you have any questions about our practices, you can contact
us at:&nbsp;

What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?&nbsp;
<p>For each visitor to a Sony Electronics Inc. Website, our Web server
automatically recognizes and stores the visitor’s IP address/Domain name
combination. Your computer provides this information automatically each
time you log on, unless you’ve activated blocking technology available
in some browsers. We also may combine your IP Address/Domain name combination
with other information you provide us like your e-mail address. You provide
this information when, for example, you post messages to our bulletin boards,
send us an e-mail, submit postings to our chat areas, fill out a registration,
answer a survey, complete a fulfillment order or sign up for a site newsletter.
We may also use a technology called "cookies" to record your activity while
you are online. This technology allows us to do things like remember the
items you want to purchase as you shop. We provide these as examples of
our practices and encourage you to decide whether you want us to have this
information. Data collected during your visit to a Sony Electronics Inc.
Website is used for internal review and may be used to improve or customize
the Website content or layout and/or notify consumers about updates to
our Websites. The information may be shared with other Sony organizations
and/or third parties if we think it appropriate to do so, e.g., for marketing
purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p><p>Opt Out.
</p><p>Some of the pages contained within the Sony Electronics Inc. Websites
allow you to opt out of Sony’s use or sharing of your information (e.g.,
for future marketing campaigns conducted by Sony or third parties). If
opting-out is offered, these sites will prompt you to select your preference
when entering personally identifiable information. When you opt out, you
do so only for that particular submission. Because Sony and others may
already have your personal information on file through other means like
product registration, you may receive materials from other sources. If
you have any questions about materials you receive, you can send an e-mail
to the above address. As we upgrade our Website technology, we are committed
to providing you with the opportunity to access and modify your record
and select personal preferences.&nbsp;
</p><p>Your Consent.
</p><p>By submitting your information to us, you are consenting to the uses
we describe above. If you do not consent to these uses, we suggest you
opt out where available, activate blocking technology if available in your
browser, or choose not to submit your data. This is a Website of Sony Electronics
Inc.&nbsp;
</p><p>Our postal address is:&nbsp;
