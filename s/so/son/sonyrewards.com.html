<b><u>Your Privacy</u></b>
<br>
<p>At Sony we believe our online visitors have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect when you visit our Web sites and what type of information is collected. The guidelines contained herein apply only to your visit to the Web sites operated by or for Sony Electronics Inc. and the entities it controls (collectively, "SEL").    These sites include, but are not limited to, those that contain "sel.sony.com" and those that contain "sonystyle.com" in their URLs.   Sites which are linked to/from these sites (including sites of other Sony affiliated companies (e.g., Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Computer Entertainment America) and via banner ads) may have different policies; therefore, please review the privacy policy notices on those sites for details.
</p><p>While SEL does not generally require that you provide us with personally identifiable information in order to visit and use the SEL sites, please note that in order to participate in some activities, it will be necessary for you to provide this information.   If you choose not to provide it for those activities, you may not be able to participate in them.
<br><br>
<b><u>Collection of Information</u></b>
<br>
</p><p>For each visitor to an SEL Web site, SEL's Web server automatically recognizes, collects and/or stores information such as the visitor's IP address/Domain name combination and any referring sites.  SEL may use several technologies to accomplish this.  Examples of such technologies are cookies and Web beacons.
</p><p>When you visit SEL's Web sites or advertisements appearing thereon, or use one or more of the SEL Web site services, we may use an industry-wide technology called "cookies" which stores certain information on your computer and which will allow us to customize your experience to better match your interests and preferences or to simply facilitate your signing in to use the services.  Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.   However, if you block or erase cookies, we may not be able to restore any preferences or customization settings you previously specified and our ability to personalize your online experience would be limited.  Please refer to your browser instructions or "help" screen to learn more about these functions.
</p><p>SEL may also itself use, or engage third parties to use, Web beacons for researching certain usage and activities on our Web site.  The information collected by SEL or requested from third parties through these Web beacons  is in an aggregate, non-individually identifiable form and is used to find out more about users including demographic information and usage patterns for more accurate reporting and to improve the effectiveness of our marketing.
</p><p>SEL may ask you to provide "personal information", meaning individually identifiable information such as your email address, name, mailing address, telephone number, social security number, credit card number, or persistent identifier (such as a customer number held in a cookie) which is associated with individually identifiable information, to enable you to participate in contests, chat rooms, on bulletin boards, to fill out a registration, or to order products and services using these sites.    SEL may combine the information you provide on our Web sites with information we may collect offline from you or from third parties so that we can more effectively tailor our site, services and offerings to you.
<br><br>
<b><i>Unless you instruct us otherwise,</i></b> SEL may contact you to provide information about products, services, promotions, contests, or other activities or offerings that may be of interest to you. You can instruct us whether or not you wish to be contacted by checking or unchecking the box indicating your preference, as applicable, at the place where your information is collected, or by other means (such as an email request).     In addition, with each communication you receive from SEL, you will be given the opportunity to indicate if you do not wish to receive future communications.
</p><p>SEL will not share the personal information you provide on the SEL Web sites with any other parties, except (a) with your consent, (b) as may be permitted or required by law or court order and/or (c) to persons or companies with whom SEL contracts to carry out the internal operations of the site or our business (for example, to send you a promotional item that you have requested on the site.)
</p><p><b><i>With your consent,</i></b> SEL may share your personal information with other affiliated Sony companies (i.e., (i) Sony Corporation, (ii) any company of which more than 50% of its outstanding shares are owned by Sony Corporation, directly or indirectly, and (iii) any company with the name "SONY" as a part of its trade name) who may want to contact you about products, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you.  Further, <b><i>with your consent,</i></b> SEL may share your personal information with specific third parties outside of the Sony group of companies who may want to contact you about products, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you.   Each of these companies may have their own privacy policies.  SEL will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either by an "opt-out" or "opt-in" method, or by other means (such as an email request). If you consent to receiving communications from any of these affiliated Sony companies, or third parties, you will need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications. 
<br><br>
<b><u>Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Aggregated Information</u></b>
<br>
</p><p>SEL may also collect, aggregate and maintain anonymous  information about the visitors to our Web sites, such as visitors hobbies, interests, purchasing habits, music preferences, and the like. This data can then be used to tailor SEL's Web site content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our visitors.   SEL may also share such aggregate information about our visitors with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties; for example, to inform them about the percentage of male/female visitors or percentage of visitors within a particular age range.
<br><br>
<b><u>Security</u></b>
<br>
</p><p>SEL takes great care in maintaining the security of your personal information and in preventing unauthorized access to it through the use of appropriate technology and internal procedures.  However, SEL does not guarantee that unauthorized access will never occur.
<br><br>
<b><u>Notice To/Regarding Children Under the Age of 13</u></b>
<br>
</p><p>SEL believes that children using the Internet require special protection, and we urge parents or guardians to explain Internet safety to their children. Parents are urged to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content available on the SEL sites and the Internet in general. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers to help create a safer environment for children.
</p><p>If you are under 13 years of age, you should not provide any personally identifiable information (for example, your last name, home address or e-mail address) on these sites without the knowledge and permission of your parent or guardian. If SEL learns that you are under 13 years of age, SEL will not maintain or use any personally identifiable information about you without the verifiable consent of your parent or guardian, except as allowed by law. This may mean that you will be unable to participate in some activities on the sites without that verifiable consent.
</p><p>If a child under 13 years of age wishes to participate in any SEL Web site activity, or wishes to take advantage of a product or service offering, available to children, and to do so necessitates the furnishing of any of the child's personal information, please note the following:
</p><p>
(i)	The names, addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses of the operators collecting or maintaining personal information from children through this Web site are:
<br><br>
Sony Electronics Inc.<br>
1 Sony Drive<br>
Park Ridge, New Jersey 07656<br>
Telephone:  201-930-4800<br>
e-mail address:    <a href="mailto:PIM@am.sony.com">PIM@am.sony.com</a><br><br>

e-mail address:   <a href="mailto:PIM@am.sony.com">PIM@am.sony.com</a><br><br>
</p><p>
(ii)	The types of personal information collected from children may include the name, email address, home address, telephone number and/or any other information reasonably necessary for the child to participate in a particular activity.  This information may be collected directly and/or passively (e.g., through a web server that automatically recognized and stores information such as a visitor's IP address/domain name combination).
</p><p>
(iii)	The information collected may be used for purposes such as fulfillment of a requested transaction, record keeping, marketing back to the child, or making it publicly available through a chat room or by other means.
</p><p>
(iv)	Unless specific consent is obtained from the child's parent or guardian, the child's personal information will not be disclosed to third parties who are not contractors hired to carry out the internal operations of the Web sites, other than as may be required or permitted by law.    We have required, or will require, such contractors to agree to use personal information of site visitors only for the purposes of carrying out these operations and to keep such information confidential.   A parent or guardian has the option of consenting to the collection and use of the child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties.
</p><p>
(v)  SEL is prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity; and 
</p><p>
(vi)  A parent can review and have deleted the child's personal information, can refuse to permit further collection or use of the child's information, and can revoke or limit consents previously given.  For instructions on how to do so, please  send an email to: <a href="mailto:PIM@am.sony.com">PIM@am.sony.com</a> or write to us at:
<br><br>
Sony Electronics Inc.<br>
Personal Information Management Office<br>
1 Sony Drive<br>
MD TA3-12<br>
Park Ridge, New Jersey 07656<br>
</p><p>Except as permitted by law, before any collection of a child's personal information takes place at a Web site directed to children or where SEL is knowingly collecting children's personal information, the child will be asked to provide  his/her parent's or guardian's e-mail address so that SEL can contact the child's parent or guardian.   SEL will then send an email (the "Initial Notification") to the parent/guardian indicating, among other things, the information that the child is requested to provide, the intended use(s) of the information and information on how the parent/guardian can, at their election, delete the child's information from SEL's database or records. Upon receipt of the Initial Notification, a parent or guardian may respond back to SEL to grant his/her consent or to deny consent in which case SEL will delete the parent or guardian's email address and any other personal information, if any, previously obtained for securing parental consent.   Upon SEL's receipt of the parent/guardian consent, SEL will send a confirming email to the parent/guardian's email address.
</p><p>If SEL desires to use a child's information for purposes other than that for which the parent/guardian consent was previously given, SEL will not do so without first getting the parent/guardian consent.
<br><br>
<b><u>Consent to Processing</u></b>
<br>
</p><p>By providing any personal information to the SEL Sites, all users, including without limitation users in the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in the United States of America.
<br><br>
<b><u>Policy Governs Use: Changes to Privacy Policy</u></b>
<br>
</p><p>The terms of this policy will govern the use and any information collected while it is in place.   SEL reserves the right to change this policy at any time, so please re-visit this page as often as you wish.
<br><br>
