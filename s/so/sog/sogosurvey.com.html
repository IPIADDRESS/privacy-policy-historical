Like the postal service, we understand that the Information we deliver belongs to you and your survey participants, not us. At SoGoSurvey, it is a core business principle that we must protect the privacy of our customers and survey participants or we will not have either. With this principle in mind, SoGoSurvey created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy.</p>
                    <p class="mb">You should be assured that our practices stated in this policy are practiced worldwide. SoGoSurvey is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. We may share information between SoGoSurvey entities and transfer it to offices around the world. Some countries may provide less legal protection for personal information than the country in which the information was provided. No matter the country standards, we will still handle the information in the manner we describe here.</p>
                    <p class="mb">This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on our web site at the URL <a href="http://www.sogosurvey.com/">http://www.SoGoSurvey.com</a> (the "Site") SoGoSurvey service platform.

                    <ol class="alpha_list">
                        <li><span class="fwt-bd">Participant Information with Customer:</span> Our business is the provision of tools that allow you, our Customer, to conduct meaningful surveys with your employees, suppliers, customers and constituents. Accordingly, we provide you with access to the Participant Information given in response to the surveys you have conducted. You may use the Participant Information consistent with your own privacy policy and applicable law.</li>
                        <li><span class="fwt-bd">As You Explicitly Allow:</span> We may share or otherwise use your Customer Information as you explicitly allow us and we may share Participant Information as both you and the Survey Participant expressly allow. For example, you are given the opportunity to either hide or make available to Survey Participants certain Customer contact information in connection with any survey.</li>
                        <li><span class="fwt-bd">Agents Acting on Our Behalf:</span> We may share some of your Information with other companies who provide us with technical and other type of services such as a credit card processor.

We do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties who are not services providers.</li>
                        <li><span class="fwt-bd">For Legal Reasons:</span> We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

Unique user names and passwords must be entered each time a person logs on. The Site is hosted in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other technology to reasonably prevent access from outside intruders.

Information collected after the new policy is posted will be used in conformance with the new policy. Information gathered under the old policy will continue to be used in conformance with that policy unless we, in conjunction with Customer, notify Survey Participants of the changes and the Survey Participant does not prohibit the use of the Information in conformance with the new policy. If we make any material changes we will notify you or our Client by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
