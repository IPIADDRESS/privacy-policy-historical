                                Customer Information: When Customers register on the Site, we ask you to give us name and contact information: company name, name of contact, title of contact, company address, telephone number, email address, user name and password, and billing information which may include credit card numbers. Customers also provide us with Information regarding the Services you have ordered (e.g., the number of surveys Customers will pay for or whether you want a private or public survey). In addition to the Information you knowingly provide, we also know when and how often you log on to the Site. (See “Tracking Technologies” below).</p>
                            <p>
                                Participant Information: We receive Participant Information from both Customers and Survey Participants. You provide us with the email address, and sometimes the name, of each Participant. Before receiving such Information, we contractually require that you warranty that you have a pre-existing relationship with the Survey Participant and/or the Survey Participant's permission to receive electronic messages. Survey Participants provide us with the Information requested by you, for example, their gender or zip code, as well as all answers to the survey questions. Customers are solely responsible for the content of the surveys and we do not control the theme or questions asked in any survey. In order to enhance survey response rates, we record: (i) if and when a Survey Participant has responded to a survey and (ii) if and when a Survey Participant has received a reminder. In addition, we receive any Information contained in any communications a Survey Participant makes directly with SoGoSurvey. (See “Tracking Technologies” below).
