                  <p>The Dial Corporation will specifically instruct children
                    not to submit information on our web site. If a child has

                    this information deleted from their records. We will use
                    reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from

                    other than to communicate wit the parent. After we have obtained
                    the parent's request, we may keep the parent's information
