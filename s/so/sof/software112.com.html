      SOFTWARE112 collect data from you and how it is used.&nbsp; In particular
      GDPR focuses on data collected which is “Personal Data”; such personal
      data may be your email address, your first and last name, or your IP
      address.&nbsp; Where we collect Personal Data this policy tells you where
      is it collected, the type of data that is collected, the legal basis upon
      which we process that data, the reason for collecting the data, and the
      use we make of the data.&nbsp; Notes are also provided which provide more
      information on the processing of that particular data source.</p>
