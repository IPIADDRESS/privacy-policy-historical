        Imark is committed to the internet </font><font size="2" face="Arial">as 
        a powerful means of communication, research and doing business. And </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Imark 
        is committed to your privacy. To protect your privacy while </font><font size="2" face="Arial">allowing 
        you to utilize all that Imark has to offer, we have developed and </font><font size="2" face="Arial">follow 
        certain principles for audience and user privacy and data </font><font size="2" face="Arial">protection.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Imark collects personal information about 
        our users during registration </font><font size="2" face="Arial">for our 
        events, use of our site services, from order forms for our </font><font size="2" face="Arial">publications/newsletters, 
        upon user entry into an Imark's content, and </font><font size="2" face="Arial">through 
        our "cookie" technology as you use and navigate our sites.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> If you choose not to provide personal information, 
        you can still use most </font><font size="2" face="Arial">of our site(s).

        registration.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> We aggregate the data we collect to create 
        a demographic picture of the </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Imark
