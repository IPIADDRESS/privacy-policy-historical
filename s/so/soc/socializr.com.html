<section class="text">
  <p>
    Punchbowl, Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy and providing you
    the most powerful and safe online experience. This publication intends to
    help you understand how personal information you provide to Punchbowl, Inc.
    is collected and used, so you can make informed decisions when using the
    website located at https://www.punchbowl.com ("Punchbowl").
  </p>

  <p>
    By using Punchbowl, you consent to the data practices described in this
    statement. Notices of all changes that materially affect ways that your
    personally identifiable information may be used or shared will be posted in
    updates to our privacy policy. If you continue to use Punchbowl and
    services after these notices of changes have been posted to the site, you
    hereby provide your consent to the changed practices. 
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact:
    <a href="mailto:privacy@punchbowl.com">privacy@punchbowl.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>

  </h2>

  <p>
    In order to become a Punchbowl member you must first register for our
    service. During this registration process you are required to provide
    personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address and name.
    Once you are a member you may provide additional information for your
    member profile such as home address, zip code, date of birth, gender,
    preferences, interests and favorites. Providing additional information
    beyond what is required at registration is optional, but will allow you to
    better identify yourself and find services at Punchbowl.
  </p>

  <p>
    Punchbowl, Inc. does not solicit, or knowingly collect and store personal
    information from anyone under the age of 13. Punchbowl, Inc. will
    immediately remove and delete any and all information from anyone under 13
    if notification is provided that a person under 13 registered at Punchbowl.
    If you have a reason to believe information was collected about a child
    under 13, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@punchbowl.com">privacy@punchbowl.com</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is
    automatically collected by Punchbowl, Inc. This information can include:
    your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, pages visited,
    features used and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by
    Punchbowl, Inc. for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of
    the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of Punchbowl.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to invite others to view your Punchbowl page, you must provide
    Punchbowl, Inc. with their email addresses or phone number. In order to
    send messages to your guests through Punchbowl, we require that you submit
    to Punchbowl current, valid email addresses or phone numbers for your
    guests. When you send messages to your guests, we collect and retain the
    email addresses, phone number, or other pertinent contact information of
    those persons to whom you send the message. Even though we retain contact
    information about your guests, Punchbowl, Inc. will not use these email
    addresses to send promotional communications, newsletters, or service
    announcements without your explicit permission, nor will we intentionally
    sell or otherwise disclose guest contact information that you submit to any
    third party. If a guest chooses to register with Punchbowl, that individual
    will be considered a Punchbowl member and may receive promotional
    communications, newsletters, and service announcements from Punchbowl, Inc.
    according to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally
    sensitive data through Punchbowl public message boards, this information
    may be collected and used by others. Punchbowl, Inc. does not read any of
    your private online communications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Punchbowl, Inc. encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web
    sites you choose to link to from Punchbowl so that you can understand how
    those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Punchbowl, Inc. is
    not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites
    outside of the Punchbowl and Punchbowl, Inc. family of Web sites.
  </p>

  <h2>
    How We Use Your Personal Information
  </h2>

  <p>
    Punchbowl, Inc. collects and uses your personal information to operate
    Punchbowl and deliver the services you have requested. When you register
    with Punchbowl, you are automatically enrolled in our marketing emails.
    These marketing emails have information about upcoming holidays, new
    features, and useful tips about using the website. If you do not wish to
    receive these marketing emails, simply unsubscribe the first time you
    receive an email. You can quickly and easily unsubscribe by clicking the
    "Unsubscribe" links in the email. When you unsubscribe, you will no longer
    receive the marketing emails. However, you will continue to receive emails
    that are related to your usage of the Punchbowl website. Punchbowl, Inc.
    also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other
    products or services available from Punchbowl, Inc. and its affiliates.
    Punchbowl, Inc. may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about
    your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be
    offered. Punchbowl, Inc. will communicate with you through emails and
    messages posted on Punchbowl.
  </p>

  <p>
    Punchbowl, Inc. may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of carefully
    selected business partners about a particular offering that we believe may
    be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable
    information (e-mail, name, address, zip code) is not transferred to the
    third party. In addition, Punchbowl, Inc. may share data with trusted
    partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal
    mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third
    parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to
    provide these services to Punchbowl, Inc., and they are required to
    maintain the confidentiality of your information.
  </p>

  <p>
    From time to time, Punchbowl, Inc. may enter into strategic partnerships in
    which your personally identifiable information may be provided to a
    carefully selected business partner. These strategic partnerships may
    include private-label, co-branded websites, or other promotional web pages
    for which Punchbowl, Inc. receives financial compensation. Any strategic
    partners to whom we disclose personal information may have their own
    privacy policies, which describe how they use and disclose personal
    information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of
    your personal information once we have shared it with those strategic
    partners as described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Punchbowl, Inc. keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit
    within Punchbowl, in order to determine what Punchbowl, Inc. services are
    the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and
    advertising within Punchbowl to customers whose behavior indicates that
    they are interested in a particular subject area.
  </p>

  <p>
    Punchbowl, Inc. will disclose your personal information, without notice,
    only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such
    action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with
    legal process served on Punchbowl, Inc. or the site; (b) protect and defend
    the rights or property of Punchbowl, Inc.; and, (c) act under exigent
    circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Punchbowl, Inc.,
    or the public.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notwithstanding any other provision, we may allow third parties to monitor
    Site activity using cookies, web beacons and similar technologies for the
    purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, targeted advertisements,
    “click-throughs” and/or other activities. We may also engage a data
    provider who may collect web log data from you (including IP address and
    information about your browser or operating system) through cookies. The
    cookies may reflect demographic or other data linked to data you
    voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may
    share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. Our
    partners may place or recognize a cookie on your computer or device via
    their pixel on our website and in email communications you've opted to
    receive from us. Our partners use this information to recognize you across
    different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics,
    attribution, and reporting purposes. This information is used to help
    select and display targeted advertisements that are believed to be of
    interest to you (sometimes called "online behavioral advertising" or
    "interest-based advertising" or "OBA"). If you would like to "opt-out" of
    being served OBA on the Website by our third-party advertising companies,
    please go to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we or a data partner we have
    engaged may collect and store a unique identifier matched to your mobile
    device, in order to deliver customized ads or content while you use
    applications or surf the internet, or to seek to identify you in a unique
    manner across other devices or browsers. In order to customize these ads or
    content, we or a data partner may connect de-identified demographic or
    other data about you (received from third parties) either to data you
    voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, or to data
    passively collected from you, such as your device identifier or IP address.

  <h2>
    Use of Cookies 
  </h2>

  <p>
    Like most websites, Punchbowl, Inc. uses "cookies" to allow you to bypass
    the login screen ("Remember Me" functionality). A cookie is a tiny data
    file, which resides on your computer and allows Punchbowl, Inc. to
    recognize you as a member when you return to Punchbowl from the same
    computer and browser. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver
    viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can
    only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature
    to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that
    you have returned to a specific page. For example, when you register with
    Punchbowl, a cookie helps Punchbowl, Inc. to recall your specific
    information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording
    your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
    and so on. When you return to Punchbowl, the information you previously
    provided can be retrieved. 
  </p>

  <p>
    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
    automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
    setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies,
    you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Punchbowl
    services.

  <h2>
    Security of Your Personal Information
  </h2>

  <p>
    Punchbowl, Inc. secures your personal information from unauthorized access,
    use or disclosure. Punchbowl, Inc. secures the personally identifiable
    information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure
    environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When
    personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other
    Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the
    Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
  </p>


  <h2>
    How You Can Control Your Personal Information 
  </h2>

  <p>
    You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal
    information in the following ways:
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for
    direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing
    to or emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@punchbowl.com">privacy@punchbowl.com</a>. 
  </p>

  <p>
    If you wish to unsubscribe from receiving marketing emails from Punchbowl,
    Inc. please click the unsubscribe link included in the footer of all of our
    emails.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or
    incomplete, please email at <a href="mailto:privacy@punchbowl.com">privacy@punchbowl.com</a>. We will promptly correct
    any information found to be incorrect. You may also request that we delete
    the information we have collected about you at any time by emailing us at
    <a href="mailto:privacy@punchbowl.com">privacy@punchbowl.com</a>. Please note that in certain circumstances, we may
    not be able to completely remove your information from our systems. For
    example, we may retain your information for legitimate business purposes,
    if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, for account
    recovery purposes, if required by law or as retained in our data backup
    systems or cached or archived pages, or where the burden or expense of
    accommodating your request would, in our good faith judgment, be
    disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or where the rights of
    others may be violated. All retained personal information will continue to
    be subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy to which the User has
    previously agreed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, you may request access to the information we have collected about
    you by sending a request to <a href="mailto:privacy@punchbowl.com">privacy@punchbowl.com</a>.

    protection laws less stringent than or otherwise different from the laws in
    effect in the country in which you are located. Where we transfer your
    personal information out of the country in which you are located, we will
    take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate
    level of protection where it is processed and your rights continue to be
