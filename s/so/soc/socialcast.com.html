Children Under the Age of 13
</h3>
<p>
The Company cares about the safety of children. Since our content and services are not directed towards kids, children under 13 are not allowed to register with our website or to participate in public posting areas on our website. If a child under the age of 13 tries to register, they will be “bumped-out” of the registration process after entering their birth date.   In the event that we discover we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, the Company will delete that information as soon as possible.
</p>
<h5 id="collected-info">
