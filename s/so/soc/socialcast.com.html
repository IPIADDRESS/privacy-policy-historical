<h3 id="children-under-13">
Children Under the Age of 13
</h3>
<p>
The Company cares about the safety of children. Since our content and services are not directed towards kids, children under 13 are not allowed to register with our website or to participate in public posting areas on our website. If a child under the age of 13 tries to register, they will be “bumped-out” of the registration process after entering their birth date. In the event that we discover we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, the Company will delete that information as soon as possible.
</p>
<h3 id="collected-info">
Collection and Use of Personal Information
</h3>
<p>
Upon registration with the Company, a user profile is developed to further customize the user’s experience. We collect the following personal information from you:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Contact Information such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number, Company Name
</li>
<li>
Unique Identifiers such as user name, account number, password
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once you use the service, we may also collect other information from you, if you provide such information while using the service.  The information may include, but is not limited to:
</p>
<p>
Demographic information such as age, education, job title, business unit, department, start date, usernames, application usage, gender, location, interests and zip code.  Because user privacy is important to us, access to the raw user data is restricted within the Company to our data scientists and authorized employees.    After the data is scrubbed of personally identifiable information, we use this information internally to analyze general usage patterns and determine how users are using different aspects of the service in order to improve it and provide a better experience to our users.
</p>
<p>
As is true of most Web sites, we automatically gather information about your computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system. We use this information to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Send you requested product or service information
</li>
<li>
Respond to customer service requests
</li>
<li>
Respond to your questions and concerns
</li>
<li>
Display content based upon your interests
</li>
<li>
Provide a customized experience
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We enable you to create a profile, and share information such as messages, photos, and videos with others. Please note that we cannot control the actions of others with whom you may choose to share your pages and information.
</p>
<p>
In addition, tracking information may be collected as you navigate through our site. To help us serve your needs better, we use "cookies" to store and sometimes track user information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your browser.
</p>
<h3 id="how-we-use-info">
How We Use Your Information
</h3>
<p>
Among our primary goals in collecting information is to provide you with a customized experience when visiting our site and to make our site more valuable to you. We use this information to closely monitor which areas of the site are used most and to determine which areas we need to focus on improving. As indicated above, access to identifiable information is restricted, and information in aggregate form is used by the Company so that we may continue to improve the value of the services and information on our website for our members as a whole.
</p>
<p>
The Company uses your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our computer server, and to administer our web site(the "Website"). Your IP address is used to help identify you, and to gather broad demographic data. Your IP address contains no personal information about you.
</p>
<p>
Users of our website should be aware that non-personal information and data may also be automatically collected by virtue of the standard operation of the Company’s computer servers or through the use of “cookies”. Cookies are files a website can use to recognize repeat users, and allow a website to track web usage behavior. Cookies take up minimal room on your computer and cannot damage your computer’s files. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website. Users should be aware that the Company cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by third-parties. If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. There may, however, be some features on the website which require the use of cookies in order to customize the delivery of information to you.
</p>
<h3 id="disclosure">
Information Sharing
</h3>
<p>
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. The Company does not sell or rent personal information about its customers to any third parties. In the event the Company does engage in such commerce in the future, notice will be given and you will have an opportunity to remove yourself from any such lists prior to your inclusion therein by emailing us at
<a href="mailto:%73%75%70%70%6F%72%74%40%73%6F%63%69%61%6C%63%61%73%74%2E%63%6F%6D">support@socialcast.com</a>. The Company may, however, perform statistical analysis of customer usage in order to measure interest in, and use of, the various parts of the Website, and the Company may share that information in the course of its business, but such shared information shall be in aggregated form only (statistics, etc.), and will contain no personally identifiable information whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
</p>
<p>
We may also disclose your personal information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
</li>
<li>
when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
</li>
<li>
if Socialcast is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information;
</li>
<li>
to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Company cooperates with all law enforcement inquires and with all third parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights.
</p>
<p>
You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information in public chat areas, on public bulletin boards, or in public classified advertisement areas within the Website, that information might be collected and disseminated by third-parties, and result in, among other things, unsolicited inquiries, messages, and offers from third-parties. Please understand that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and this third-party conduct is out of the control of the Company. Please also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information in private chat areas, on private bulletin boards, or in private classified advertisement areas within the Website, all users who are authorized to access such areas will have access to such personal information, and that information might be collected and disseminated by those users, and result in, among other things, unsolicited inquiries, messages, and offers from such users. The Company urges you to please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information on the Website, in either public or private areas of the Website.

Web beacons
</em>
</h5>
<p>
Our Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients.

<p>
 The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>
<p>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet, and any information you transmit to the Company you do at your own risk. We recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone.
