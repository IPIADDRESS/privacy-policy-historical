Since our content and services are not directed towards kids, children under 13 are not allowed to register with our website or to participate in public posting areas on our website. If a child under the age of 13 tries to register, they will be "bumped-out" of the registration process after entering their birth date. In the event that we discover we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, the Company will delete that information as soon as possible.</p><h3 id="collected-info">Collection and Use of Personal Information</h3><p>Upon registration with the Company, a user profile is developed to further customize the user's experience. We collect the following personal information from you:</p><ul><li>Contact Information such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number, Company Name</li><li>Unique Identifiers such as user name, account number, password</li></ul><p>Once you use the service, we may also collect other information from you, if you provide such information while using the service. The information may include, but is not limited to:<br>Demographic information such as age, education, job title, business unit, department, start date, usernames, application usage, gender, location, interests and zip code. Because user privacy is important to us, access to the raw user data is restricted within the Company to our data scientists and authorized employees. After the data is scrubbed of personally identifiable information, we use this information internally to analyze general usage patterns and determine how users are using different aspects of the service in order to improve it and provide a better experience to our members.</p><p>As is true of most Web sites, we automatically gather information about your computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system.</p><p>We use this information to:</p><ul><li>Send you product, service, and new feature information</li><li>Respond to customer service requests</li><li>Respond to requests for pricing information</li><li>Respond to your questions and concerns</li><li>Display content based upon your interests</li><li>Provide a customized experience</li><li>Send you newsletters and other promotional communications to enhance your experience with our products and services</li></ul><p>We enable you to create a profile, and share information such as messages, photos, and videos with others. Please note that we cannot control the actions of others with whom you may choose to share your pages and information.</p><p>In addition, tracking information may be collected as you navigate through our site. To help us serve your needs better, we use "cookies" to store and sometimes track user information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.

Cookies are files a website can use to recognize repeat users, and allow a website to track web usage behavior. Cookies take up minimal room on your computer and cannot damage your computer's files. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website.
