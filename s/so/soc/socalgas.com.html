			<p><a href="privacyCh.html"><em>中 文 版 </em></a></p>
			<p><em>Effective November 7, 2006<br>
                  <br>
              </em>Thank you for visiting SoCalGas's Web site. We are committed to
			  protecting the reasonable expectations of privacy of the visitors to
			  our Web site. </p>
			<h2><strong>Traffic Data</strong></h2>
			<p>To improve the usefulness of our Web site for our visitors, we automatically
			  collect and maintain statistical information from our Web site's
			  data logs that concern network traffic flow and volume ("Traffic Data"). Traffic Data
			  consists of the:</p>
			<ul>
              <li>name of the domain, or URL, from which the visitor accesses the
                Internet (e.g.,  "a company.com"; "a school.edu";
                or "an agency.gov"); </li>
			  <li>Internet Protocol Number; </li>
			  <li>type of Web browser used; and </li>
			  <li>date and time this Web site is visited. </li>
	    </ul>
			<p>Traffic Data does not identify individual visitors. Traffic Data
			  is, however, helpful in permitting us to improve our Web site and
			  to maintain its accessibility.</p>
			<h2>General Visitors</h2>
			<p>For general visitors not using applications requiring an authenticated
			  log-in, SoCalGas may use cookies for purposes of gathering Traffic
			  Data. Cookies are files placed on a visitor's hard drive that allow
			  the Web site to monitor the individual's use of the site. No attempts

			<ul>
              <li>individual services are requested; </li>
			  <li>application is made regarding possible employment;</li>
			  <li>inclusion on a SoCalGas mailing list is requested; </li>
			  <li>illegal behavior or unauthorized activities are suspected; or </li>
			  <li>user identification is required under law. </li>
	    </ul>
			<p>SoCalGas will not disclose the information you give us with any
			  third party except to the extent such third party requires such information
			  in order to perform services for SoCalGas related to SoCalGas’s
			  own business purposes, unless required by law, or when necessary
			  to protect the Web site or SoCalGas. We will not collect or sell
			  your information for commercial purposes with third parties.</p>
