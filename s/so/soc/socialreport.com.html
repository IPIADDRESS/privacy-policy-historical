                                We at Social Report (SocialReport.com) are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to both our Website (www.socialreport.com) and our Subscription Service (the Subscription Service), including our associated mobile applications (Mobile Apps) owned and controlled by Social Report. This Privacy Policy governs our data collection, processing and usage practices. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We periodically update this Privacy Policy. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice by sending you an email notification, or if you subscribe to the Subscription Service, through the Notification app in your Social Report portal.

                            <p>
                                While we will notify you of any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.

                            <h3>Use of the Subscription Service by Social Report and our Customers</h3>

                            <h4>The Social Report Subscription Service</h4>

                            <p>Our online Subscription Service allows any company that uses it (our customers and Social Report itself) to create and share marketing, sales and customer service content. The Subscription Service can also be used to help organize sales data about a company’s sales pipeline (e.g., leads, customers, deals, etc.). The information added to the Subscription Service, either by site visitors providing their contact information or when a Subscription Service user adds the information, is stored and managed on our service providers' servers. This information is then used to contact visitors about their interest in the company's goods or services and interact with the company. Social Report provides the Subscription Service to our customers for their own marketing, lead generation, and customer service needs, and we use it to meet Social Report’s related needs.</p>

                            <h4>Use by Social Report</h4>

                            <p>We use our own Subscription Service to build webpages that people can visit to learn more about Social Report. Information that we collect and manage using the Subscription Service for our own marketing belongs to us and is used, disclosed and protected according to this Privacy Policy.</p>

                            <h4>Use by Our Customers</h4>

                            <p>Our customers use the Subscription Service to build webpages that people can visit to learn more about their business. Social Report does not control the content of these webpages or the types of information that our customers may choose to collect or manage using the Subscription Service. That information belongs to them and is used, disclosed and protected by them according to their privacy policies and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Social Report processes our customers' information as they direct and in accordance with our agreements with our customers, and we store it on our service providers' servers, but we do not have control over its collection or management. Our agreements with our customers prohibit us from using that information, except as necessary to provide and improve the Subscription Service, as permitted by this Privacy Policy, and as required by law. We have no direct relationship with individuals who provide Personal Information to our customers. Social Report acknowledges that you have the right to access your Personal Information. Our customers control and are responsible for correcting, deleting or updating information they have collected from you using the Subscription Service. If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. We may work with our customers to help them provide notice to their visitors about their data collection, processing and usage. Our agreements with our customers prohibit them from using the Subscription Service to collect, manage, or process Sensitive Information. We are not responsible for our customers' use of information they collect on the Subscription Service.</p>

                            <p>Social Report collects information under the direction of its customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Information it processes. If you are a customer of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customer that use our Subscription Service, please contact the customer that you interact with directly. We may transfer Personal Information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.</p>

                            <h4>"Sensitive Information"</h4>

                            <p>This refers to credit or debit card numbers, personal financial account information, Social Security numbers, passport numbers, driver's license numbers or similar personal identifiers, racial or ethnic origin, physical or mental health condition or information, or other employment, financial or health information.</p>

                            <p>We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, we do not transfer your Personal Information to the third party.</p>

                            <p>We use the information collected through our Subscription Service by our customers for the following purposes:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>to provide the Subscription Service (which may include the detection, prevention and resolution of security and technical issues);</li>
                                <li>to respond to customer support requests; and</li>

                            <p>If you are a visitor/customer located in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), Social Report Ireland Limited is the data controller of your personal information. Social Report's Data Protection Officer can be contacted at privacy@socialreport.com.</p>

                            <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.</p>

                            <p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>

                            <h4>Use of Navigational Information</h4>

                            <p>We use Navigational Information to operate and improve the Websites and the Subscription Service. We may also use Navigational Information alone or in combination with Personal Information to provide you with personalized information about Social Report.</p>

                            <p>We post customer testimonials and comments on our Websites, which may contain Personal Information. We obtain each customer's consent via email prior to posting the customer's name and testimonial.</p>

                            <h4>Use of Credit Card Information</h4>

                            <p>If you give us credit card information, we use it solely to check your financial qualifications and collect payment from you. We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.</p>

                            <h4>Security of your Personal Information</h4>

                            <p>We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We secure the Personal Information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. All Personal Information is protected using appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures.</p>

                            <h4>Social Media Features</h4>

                            <p>Our Websites include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites.
