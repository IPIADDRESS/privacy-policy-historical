(“<strong>SOCIALMEDIA</strong>”) has developed a set of technologies and processes to allow advertisers to deliver targeted content across the social networking websites (“Network Sites”) who wish to display such content (the “<strong>Network</strong>”).</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal">We consider the protection of your privacy to be of utmost importance in how we conduct our business and provide our services. This Privacy Policy applies to our website and our services provided through our Network and describes what data we collect, how we use this data to provide our services, when and to whom we disclose such data, and how you can opt out of the data collection we perform as well as our advertising services.</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal"><b>DATA COLLECTION AND USE</b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal"><b>Use of Personally Identifiable Information:&nbsp;SOCIALMEDIA Site</b><br>Advertisers and application developers (“<b>Publishers</b>”, collectively “<b>Network Participants</b>”) on various social networking platforms participating in our Network are required to register with us through our website at <a href="http://www.socialmedia.com" title="www.socialmedia.com">www.socialmedia.com</a> (the “<b>SOCIALMEDIA Site</b>”). During registration and after, Network Participants will provide SOCIALMEDIA certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to, their name, email address, and postal mailing address.</div><p>We use the personally identifiable information of our Network Participants mainly to provide the SOCIALMEDIA services, including but not limited to administering inquiries, processing, validating and verifying registrations, making contact, and processing, remitting and/or charging fees. We will use the email addresses of our Network Participants to send service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send our Network Participants a notification email. Generally, Network Participants may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If Network Participants do not wish to receive these types of service related email notifications they have the option of deactivating their account. We may also use their email address to provide notification of promotional events being offered by us. Network Participants may opt-in to these emails when they register and may later opt-out through the emails themselves. If a Network Participant's personally identifiable information changes, or if a Network Participant no longer desires&nbsp;our service, they may update or deactivate their account by making the change&nbsp;on our account information page or by contacting customer support at <a href="mailto:info@socialmedia.com">info@socialmedia.com</a> with the details of what needs to be updated.</p><p>If you contact us by email or through the SOCIALMEDIA Site (for example, as a prospective customer who requests that a SOCIALMEDIA representative contact you), we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you. This information will not be shared with other companies and is not used for purposes other than contacting or reaching out to you.</p><ul><li>We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name.&nbsp;We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>The SOCIALMEDIA Site contains a blog for which anyone can comment on postings. Any personally identifiable information submitted as comments to blog postings on the SOCIALMEDIA Site can be read, collected, or used by other users of this blog and could be used to send unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit as comments to this blog<b>.</b></li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul><div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal"><b>Use of Personally Identifiable Information:&nbsp;SOCIALMEDIA Service</b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal">SOCIALMEDIA will access your picture and first name voluntarily provided by you to your Network Site – provided that your profile is not marked “private” – to display in advertisements shown to others within the Network Site for which you have provided this information. This information is accessed through SOCIALMEDIA tags utilized by third party Publishers in their own Applications on Network Sites.</div><ul><li>When an advertisement is delivered to a user our advertisement server finds relevant friends of that user, which may include you, and may display your first name and/or picture to that user within the advertisement. SOCIALMEDIA also may also access your age and gender information provided by you to your Network Site for demographic targeting purposes. If you do not wish to have your name and picture displayed in advertisements delivered by SOCIALMEDIA or your demographic data used to deliver targeted advertisements to you, you may change the privacy settings of your public Network Site profile to disable access to this information or you may opt-out of SOCIALMEDIA’S ability to access your first name and photo by <u><a href="http://www.socialmedia.com/facebook/optout.php">clicking here</a></u>.</li><li><br>SOCIALMEDIA does not otherwise collect or use personally identifiable information about people who interact with the SOCIALMEDIA content found on any of the Network Sites serving SOCIALMEDIA content.</li></ul><div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal">&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal"><b>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information:&nbsp;SOCIALMEDIA Service</b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal">Publishers may place a SOCIALMEDIA tag in an Application on a Network Site to help us ensure advertisements served are correctly targeted. These tags are used to match visitor browsing behavior to the correct audience profile for advertisement targeting purposes (that is, to permit advertisers to deliver advertisements that are appropriate for their products or services). See the “Log Data” section below to see what information SOCIALMEDIA receives from such tags and how we use it. Check the privacy policies of Applications tagged with SOCIALMEDIA tags for information regarding how they use such information.</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal">In addition, when you visit a Network Site, such Network Site may access and collect certain information from you. This may include, but is not limited to, your Network Site ID for which that Network Site resides within, non-personal profile data you disclose to the Network Site such as gender, age, photo, city location, other Network Site IDs you communicate with as part of your interaction with the Network Site, advertisements that were delivered to you and that you clicked on, and other click-stream data. This data may be shared with SOCIALMEDIA and we will use such data to deliver more targeted content to you while visiting Network Sites.</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal"><b>Use of Behavioral Data:&nbsp;SOCIALMEDIA Service</b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal">SOCIALMEDIA will assemble non-personal behavioral, demographic and location data to create audience segments. These audience segments represent large amounts of information that have been aggregated into anonymous groups. When an advertisement is served, our advertisement server accesses this data to match the target audience with the appropriate audience segment, with only aggregate data retained by SOCIALMEDIA. This aggregate behavioral data is associated to the browser’s cookie as well as the user’s social network ID assigned by the Network Site the Application resides within.</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; line-height: normal"><b>Use of Cookies:&nbsp;SocialMedia Site</b></div><ul><li>A cookie is a small data file containing a string of alphanumeric characters that uniquely identifies your browser.</li><li><br>Like many websites, we use cookies on the SOCIALMEDIA Site (by placing or reading them via your browser) to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the SOCIALMEDIA Site.

A persistent cookie remains on your computer’s hard drive once your browser is closed and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. SOCIALMEDIA utilizes persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with Network Sites and to aggregate interactions with advertisements delivered by SOCIALMEDIA. We also utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the SOCIALMEDIA Site, to better understand how you interact with SOCIALMEDIA Site and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the SOCIALMEDIA Site. You can remove persistent cookies by following your web browser help file directions. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser.
