             <p>
              Information about your computer hardware and  software may be automatically collected by SociBuzz. This information can  include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and  referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the  service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics  regarding use of the SociBuzz website.</p>
              <p>SociBuzz encourages you to review the privacy  statements of websites you choose to link to from SociBuzz so that you can  understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. SociBuzz  is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites  outside of the SociBuzz website. </p>
  <h2>Use of  your Personal Information </h2>
              <p>SociBuzz collects and uses your personal  information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested. <br>
              SociBuzz may also use your personally  identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available  from SociBuzz and its affiliates. SociBuzz may also contact you via surveys to  conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new  services that may be offered. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
              SociBuzz does not sell, rent or lease its  customer lists to third parties. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
              SociBuzz may, from time to time, contact you  on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be  of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable  information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the  third party. SociBuzz may share data with trusted partners to help perform  statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support,  or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using  your personal information except to provide these services to SociBuzz, and  they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. </p>
              <p>SociBuzz may keep track of the websites and  pages our users visit within SociBuzz, in order to determine what SociBuzz  services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content  and advertising within SociBuzz to customers whose behavior indicates that they  are interested in a particular subject area. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
              SociBuzz will disclose your personal  information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good  faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the  law or comply with legal process served on SociBuzz or the site; (b) protect  and defend the rights or property of SociBuzz; and, (c) act under exigent  circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of SociBuzz, or the  public. </p>
  <h2>Use of  Cookies</h2>
              <p>The SociBuzz website may use  "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is  a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies  cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are  uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain  that issued the cookie to you. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
              One of the primary purposes of cookies is to  provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to  tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you  personalize SociBuzz pages, or register with SociBuzz site or services, a  cookie helps SociBuzz to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.  This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as  billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same  SociBuzz website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so  you can easily use the SociBuzz features that you customized. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
              You have the ability to accept or decline  cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually  modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to  decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive  features of the SociBuzz services or websites you visit.</p>
  <h2>Security  of your Personal Information</h2>
              <p>SociBuzz secures your personal information  from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.</p>

BY CONNECTING YOUR SOCIBUZZ ACCOUNT TO YOUR  THIRD PARTY ACCOUNT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE  CONTINUOUS RELEASE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU TO OTHERS (IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR  PRIVACY SETTINGS ON THOSE THIRD PARTY SITES).
