This COPPA Policy also explains how a parent or guardian (“parent” or “you”) can restrict the collection, use and/or disclosure of your Child’s (as defined below) information and how you can request deletion of your Child’s information.</p> <p>The Socrative Services are a classroom tool and resource that teacher end users (“Teachers”) can use as part of their classroom activities to identify levels of student understanding around their instruction on a real-time basis. To use the Services, Teachers may collect personal information from their students, including children who are under 13 years old (“Students”).

Teachers and the schools or other academic institutions with which the Teachers and the Teachers’ Students are affiliated (“Schools”) are also responsible for providing parents with notice about how personal information from their Child(ren) is collected and used by us.</p> <p>Children’s personal information will be handled only as described in this COPPA Policy.

We can be contacted at:</p> <p>Showbie<br>#403, 10113 104 Street NW<br>Edmonton, AB T5J 1A1 Canada<br><a href="mailto:legal@socrative.com">legal@socrative.com</a></p> <h4 class=" h--4">What Information Do We Collect About Children?</h4> <p><strong>How Information is Collected.</strong>&nbsp;We may collect information about Children&nbsp;<strong>directly</strong>&nbsp;from Children and/or their Teachers, as well as&nbsp;<strong>automatically</strong>&nbsp;through a Child’s use of our Site, Apps, and/or Services. We will not require a Child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to use our Services. Further, as explained below, we will not collect a Child’s name, contact information, or other personal information directly unless a Teacher or School requests it. We provide Teachers and Schools with a notice regarding our privacy practices.</p> <p><strong>Information We Collect Directly.</strong>&nbsp;Socrative does not require Children to submit name, contact information, or other personal information to us to register for our Site, Apps or Services. To log on to the Services, Children are prompted to enter either a unique and anonymous assessment ID, which will be provided to the Student by a Teacher, and/or a unique and anonymous student ID generated either by the School or by Socrative.</p> <p>We may collect a Child’s name and other limited personal information directly from a Child’s Teacher or School. Through our Services, Teachers can create assessments and track their Students’ learning progress. In doing so, Teachers may require the Child’s personal information in order to track and archive evidence of learning. Teachers are responsible for ensuring that their collection and use of personal information from Children complies with applicable laws, including COPPA and FERPA. If you are a parent and you have questions about your Child’s Teacher’s use of our Services and any information collected, you should discuss your questions with your child’s Teacher or School.</p> <p>A Teacher has the option of creating an account on behalf of their Students which allows those Students to view their learning progress and access learning resources provided by their Teacher. If a Teacher chooses to register a Child for an account, Socrative will generate a user name and temporary password and provide directly to the Teacher who may then share with the Child. The only information we collect directly from the Child is a permanent password for their account.</p> <p>We collect information about Children’s performance and activities on our Site, Apps, and Services, including the assessments taken, questions answered, and other evidence of learning. This information is made available to Teachers in personally identifiable form; we do not use this information in personally identifiable form for our own commercial purposes. If we analyze or use any activity data for our own commercial purposes, we will de-identify and/or aggregate such information.</p> <p>Parents can tell us to stop collecting personal information from their Child(ren); however, in such cases the Child(ren) will not be able to use our Services, as they are intended to be controlled by a Teacher. If you direct us to stop collecting and using your Child’s personal information, we must disable his or her use of our Services to ensure that no information is collected via the Teacher’s use of Socrative as a classroom tool.</p> <p><strong>Information We Collect Automatically.</strong>&nbsp;We may automatically collect the following information about a Child’s use of our Site, Apps, or Services through our servers and in log files: domain name; browser type and operating system; web pages viewed; links clicked; the length of time spent on our Site or Apps; the length of time our Services are used; the referring URL, or the webpage that led a user to our Site; language information; device name and model; operating system type, name, and version; and activities within our Site and Apps. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. Except as noted in this COPPA Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to a Child’s personal information.</p> <p>We may also collect IP address, device identifier or a similar unique identifier from users of our Apps and Site; we only use such identifiers to support the internal operations of our Site and Apps in the same manner as described above.</p> <p>We may also collect information from any mobile devices that a Child uses if the Child has downloaded one or more of our Apps to the device. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to the Child. Examples of information that may be collected and used include how the Child uses the App(s) and information about the type of device the Child is using. In addition, in the event our App(s) crash on a mobile device, we will receive information about the mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our App(s). This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.</p> <h4 class=" h--4">How We Use Children’s Information</h4> <p>We use the personal information that we collect from Children for the following general purposes:</p> <ul class="ul"><li>To provide our Services;</li><li>To respond to customer service and technical support issues and requests;</li><li>To identify the Child as a user in our system;</li><li>To provide improved administration of our Site, App and Services; and</li><li>To tailor the content and information that we may display to Children, to offer personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize a Child’s experiences while using the Site, Apps, or Services.</li></ul><p><strong>As Requested by Teachers.</strong>&nbsp;When a Teacher or School provides a Child’s name and other personal information, we use that personal information for the following additional purposes:</p> <ul class="ul"><li>To provide Children and Teachers with information and reports about a Child’s performance and use of the Site, Apps, and Services;</li><li>If requested, to facilitate creation of a Child’s account;</li><li>We do not use or disclose this personal information for our own commercial purposes.</li></ul><p><strong>Unique Identifiers.</strong>&nbsp;As noted, with the exception of unique identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers), our Site, Apps, and Services will not collect personal information from Children.

We never use unique identifiers to track users across third party apps or websites.</p> <p><strong>Aggregate or De-identified Information.</strong>&nbsp;We may use aggregate or de-identified information about Children for research, analysis, and similar purposes. When we do so, we strip out names, email, contact information, and other personal identifiers.

The Child’s Teacher(s) may share the Child’s scores, academic progress data or other academic information (“Academic Data”) with other Children in the Child’s class or school and with other Teachers. Parents may request information about the information we have collected from their Child(ren) by contacting us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@socrative.com">legal@socrative.com</a>.</li><li><strong>Third Party Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp;We may disclose a Child’s personal information to third-party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf and/or at the request of a school or district customer in order to: provide the Child and the Child’s Teacher with the Services that we offer through our Site and Apps; conduct quality assurance testing; facilitate creation of accounts; provide technical support; and/or provide other services to us.

We may use both session Cookies (which expire once a user closes a web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on a computer until a user deletes them). Some Cookies allow us to make it easier for a Child to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track a Child’s activities, but only as those activities relate to a Child’s use of our Site and Service.</p> <p><strong>Third-Party Analytics.</strong>&nbsp;We may also use third party analytics tools and technologies, such as Google Analytics, to track and analyze data from our Site, Apps, or Services. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the data collected by such third party analytics tools only to help us administer and improve the quality of our Site, Apps, and Services and to analyze Site and Apps usage. These third parties are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf, except to help us conduct and improve our business. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to a user on the date the user visits the Site, rather than a user’s name or other personally identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on a user’s web browser to identify the user as a unique user the next time the user visits the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about a user’s visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. For more information on Google’s privacy practices, please&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/learn/privacy.html">click here</a>. For information about how to opt out of Google Analytics, please&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">click here</a>.</p> <h4 class=" h--4">Third-Party Links</h4> <p>Teachers may provide Children with links to third-party educational and learning resources located on third party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this COPPA Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.</p> <h4 class=" h--4">Your Rights to Review, Delete, and Control Our Use of Children’s Personal Information</h4> <p>Parents and Teachers have a right to review and correct the information we have collected about their Child(ren) and Students, respectively, and to delete it, and to tell us to update it or stop using it. To exercise these rights, you may contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@socrative.com">legal@socrative.com</a>. You will be required to authenticate yourself as the Child’s parent or Teacher to receive information about that Child. Please note that we cannot delete copies of information that a Child’s Teacher has already collected and/or copied, and copies of information that you have deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site or Apps for a period of time.</p> <h4 class=" h--4">Additional Choices Regarding Children’s Personal Information</h4> <p><strong>Disabling Cookies.</strong>&nbsp;Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not be available to you.</p> <p><strong>Applications.</strong>&nbsp;You can stop all collection of information by the App(s) by uninstalling the App(s). You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p> <h4 class=" h--4">Changes to this COPPA Policy</h4> <p>This COPPA Policy is current as of the Last Updated date set forth above. We may change this COPPA Policy from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically.
