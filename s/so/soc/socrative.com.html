        <strong>Cookies.</strong>  We use cookies to track information about your use of our Sites, Apps, or Services. “Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).  Some Cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Sites and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities but only as those activities relate to your use of our Sites and Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Third-Party Analytics.</strong> We may also use third party analytics tools and technologies, such as Google Analytics, to track and analyze data from our Sites, Apps, or Services. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Sites, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Sites. We use the data collected by such third party analytics tools only to help us administer and improve the quality of our Sites, Apps, and Services and to analyze usage. These third parties are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf, except to help us conduct and improve our business. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other personally identifying information.  Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Sites, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.  Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

          <li>Once displayed publicly, the information you post in your Profile and Newsfeed can be collected and used by others.  We cannot control who reads your Newsfeed, postings or what other users may do with the information that you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you exercise caution with respect to any Personal Data that you include in your posts.

This COPPA Privacy Policy ("COPPA Policy") is designed to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and contains important information about how we collect, use, and disclose the personal information we collect from children under thirteen years old who use our websites, <a href="https://masteryconnect.com">https://masteryconnect.com</a> or <a href="https://socrative.com">https://socrative.com</a> (the "Sites"), our mobile applications (the "Apps"), and the services available through our Sites and Apps (collectively, the "Services"). This COPPA Policy also explains how a parent or guardian (“parent” or “you”) can restrict the collection, use and/or disclosure of your Child’s (as defined below) information and how you can request deletion of your Child’s information.

      </p>
      <p>
        The MasteryConnect Services are a classroom tool and resource that teacher end users (“Teachers”) can use as part of their classroom activities to identify levels of student understanding around their instruction on a real-time basis. To use the Services, Teachers may collect personal information from their students, including children who are under 13 years old (“Students”). For the purposes of this Policy,&nbsp;"Child"&nbsp;or&nbsp;"Children"&nbsp;means a Student under 13 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a Teacher uses our Services in the classroom or an educational setting, such as to sign Students up for the Services, or to assign response activities to Students and track their progress, the Teacher is required to provide consent to the collection and use of personal information from and about Children as required under applicable laws, including but not limited to COPPA and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”).  Teachers and the schools or other academic institutions with which the Teachers and the Teachers’ Students are affiliated (“Schools”) are also responsible for providing parents with notice about how personal information from their Child(ren) is collected and used by us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children's personal information will be handled only as described in this COPPA Policy. Any personal information we collect about other users (e.g., Students over 13 years old, Teachers, and parents) will be treated in accordance with the MasteryConnect Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy").

      <p><strong id="coppa-what">What Information Do We Collect About Children?</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>How Information is Collected.</strong>&nbsp;We may collect information about Children <strong>directly</strong> from Children and/or their Teachers, as well as <strong>automatically</strong> through a Child's use of our Sites, Apps, and/or Services. We will not require a Child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to use our Services. Further, as explained below, we will not collect a Child’s name, contact information, or other personal information directly unless a Teacher or School requests it. We provide Teachers and Schools with a notice regarding our privacy practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Information We Collect Directly.</strong>&nbsp;MasteryConnect does not require Children to submit name, contact information, or other personal information to us to register for our Sites, Apps or Services. To log on to the Services, Children are prompted to enter either a unique and anonymous assessment ID, which will be provided to the Student by a Teacher, and/or a unique and anonymous student ID generated either by the School or by MasteryConnect.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may collect a Child's name and other limited personal information directly from a Child's Teacher or School. Through our Services, Teachers can create assessments and track their Students’ learning progress. In doing so, Teachers may require the Child’s personal information in order to track and archive evidence of learning. Teachers are responsible for ensuring that their collection and use of personal information from Children complies with applicable laws, including COPPA and FERPA. If you are a parent and you have questions about your Child's Teacher's use of our Services and any information collected, you should discuss your questions with your child's Teacher or School.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Teacher has the option of creating an account on behalf of their Students which allows those Students to view their learning progress and access learning resources provided by their Teacher. If a Teacher chooses to register a Child for an account, MasteryConnect will generate a user name and temporary password and provide directly to the Teacher who may then share with the Child.  The only information we collect directly from the Child is a permanent password for their account.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect information about Children's performance and activities on our Sites, Apps, and Services, including the assessments taken, questions answered, and other evidence of learning. This information is made available to Teachers in personally identifiable form; we do not use this information in personally identifiable form for our own commercial purposes. If we analyze or use any activity data for our own commercial purposes, we will de-identify and/or aggregate such information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parents can tell us to stop collecting personal information from their Child(ren); however, in such cases the Child(ren) will not be able to use our Services, as they are intended to be controlled by a Teacher. If you direct us to stop collecting and using your Child's personal information, we must disable his or her use of our Services to ensure that no information is collected via the Teacher's use of MasteryConnect as a classroom tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Information We Collect Automatically.</strong>&nbsp; We may automatically collect the following information about a Child’s use of our Sites, Apps, or Services through our servers and in log files: domain name; browser type and operating system; web pages viewed; links clicked; the length of time spent on our Sites or Apps; the length of time our Services are used; the referring URL, or the webpage that led a user to our Site; language information; device name and model; operating system type, name, and version; and activities within our Sites and Apps. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users’ movements around the Sites, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.  Except as noted in this COPPA Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to a Child’s personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also collect IP address, device identifier or a similar unique identifier from users of our Apps and Sites; we only use such identifiers to support the internal operations of our Sites and Apps in the same manner as described above.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also collect information from any mobile devices that a Child uses if the Child has downloaded one or more of our Apps to the device.  This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to the Child. Examples of information that may be collected and used include how the Child uses the App(s) and information about the type of device the Child is using.   In addition, in the event our App(s) crash on a mobile device, we will receive information about the mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our App(s).  This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.

      <p><strong id="coppa-use">How We Use Children’s Information</strong></p>
      <p>
        We use the personal information that we collect from Children for the following general purposes:

      <p>
        </p><ul>
          <li>To provide our Services;</li>
          <li>To respond to customer service and technical support issues and requests; </li>
          <li>To identify the Child as a user in our system;</li>
          <li>To provide improved administration of our Site, App and Services; and</li>
          <li>To tailor the content and information that we may display to Children, to offer personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize a Child’s experiences while using the Sites, Apps, or Services.</li>
        </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <strong>As Requested by Teachers.</strong>&nbsp;When a Teacher or School provides a Child’s name and other personal information, we use that personal information for the following additional purposes:
        </p><ul>
          <li>To provide Children and Teachers with information and reports about a Child’s performance and use of the Sites, Apps, and Services;</li>
          <li>If requested, to facilitate creation of a Child’s account;</li>
          <li>We do not use or disclose this personal information for our own commercial purposes.</li>
        </ul>
      <p></p>

      <p>
        <strong>Unique Identifiers.</strong>&nbsp;As noted, with the exception of unique identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers), our Sites, Apps, and Services will not collect personal information from Children. We only collect and use unique identifiers as necessary to operate our Sites, Apps, and Services, including to maintain or analyze their functioning; perform network communications; authenticate users or personalize content; and protect the security or integrity of users and our Site, App, and Services. We never use unique identifiers to track users across third party apps or websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Aggregate or De-identified Information.</strong>&nbsp;We may use aggregate or de-identified information about Children for research, analysis, and similar purposes. When we do so, we strip out names, email, contact information, and other personal identifiers. For example, we may use aggregate or de-identified information for one or more of the following purposes, among other purposes:
      </p>
      <p>
        </p><ul>
          <li>To better understand how users access and use our Sites, Apps, and Services;</li>
          <li>To improve our Sites, Apps, and Services and respond to user desires and preferences; and</li>
          <li>For other research and analytical purposes.</li>

      <p>
        <strong>Cookies.</strong>  We use cookies to track information about a Child’s use of our Sites, Apps, or Services. “Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to a computer’s hard drive through a web browser for record-keeping purposes. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once a user closes a web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on a computer until a user deletes them).  Some Cookies allow us to make it easier for a Child to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track a Child’s activities, but only as those activities relate to a Child’s use of our Sites and Service.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Third-Party Analytics.</strong> We may also use third party analytics tools and technologies, such as Google Analytics, to track and analyze data from our Sites, Apps, or Services. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Sites, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Sites. We use the data collected by such third party analytics tools only to help us administer and improve the quality of our Sites, Apps, and Services and to analyze Sites and Apps usage. These third parties are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf, except to help us conduct and improve our business. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to a user on the date the user visits the Sites, rather than a user’s name or other personally identifying information.  Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on a user’s web browser to identify the user as a unique user the next time the user visits the Sites, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.  Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about a user’s visits to the Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
