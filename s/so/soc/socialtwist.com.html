            <p>When you access our website/services, we, or companies we hire to track how our website/service is used, may place small data files called "cookies" on your computer.</p>

            <p class="subheading">Cookies for customers accessing the SocialTwist configuration/analytics dashboard</p>
            
            <p>We set a few cookies to on your browser when you log in to your SocialTwist account. This is done to ensure you are authenticated in all the screens you interact with and so we do not need to ask you for your password on each page. We also use cookies to ensure integrity of data across accounts.<br>Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect.</p>
            
            <p class="subheading">Cookies for consumers using SocialTwist services</p>

            <p>We also use longer-lasting cookies for purposes such as to pre-fill your e-mail address when you return to a SocialTwist program registration form or to uniquely count you as a user of the program.</p>

            <p>We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website and Services.</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialtwist.com/">SocialTwist</a> website and services and we are not responsible for the privacy policies, practices or contents of any third party websites. Please refer to the privacy policies of such third party websites for information on what kinds of personal information such websites collect and their respective privacy practices, terms, and conditions.</p>

            <p>The use of cookies by our customers/partners/affiliates is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Web Beacons / Gifs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We employ [or our third party advertising partner employs] a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Analytics / Log Files</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>

            <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>

            <p>We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.</p>

            <p>However, when a user submits a form on our website or in any of our social programs, we capture all the above information and map it to the user. This is done to learn more about the user, to prevent any abuse/fraud/spam and to support the user if the user reports an issue.</p>
            
            
            <p class="subheading">Comments posted in public forums</p>
            <p>If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this website, you should be aware that any personal information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:support@socialtwist.com">support@socialtwist.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
            
            <p>We have no obligation to keep the information posted to our public website or blog private or protected in any way. All such content may be published by us in any media in our discretion. SocialTwist, its members, officers, employees and agents assume no liability or responsibility for your use of the public website or blog to post comments or other information, or for any person's use of any information you post.</p>

            <p class="subheading">Social Media Services</p>

            <p>Our website and service widgets may include social media features, enabling you, for example, to choose a social media service such as Facebook to share content with your contacts. We have programmed these features to comply with this Privacy Policy to the extent these features are hosted and operated by us. Your interactions with social media services at websites or within applications not hosted and operated by us are governed by the privacy policies of such third party services, website and applications.</p>
            
            <p class="subheading">Disclosure of information as required by law or to protect people</p>
            <p>If we are required by law, regulation or legal process (e.g. subpoena) to disclose information about you, we will notify you to the extent permitted by law but we reserve the right to disclose such information as legally required in our judgment. We also may disclose information about your use of the Services if we have reason to believe you have used Services for purposes prohibited in our Terms of Use or that it is necessary to avoid injury, damage to property or violation of someone's rights.</p>
            
            <p class="subheading">Security</p>
            <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card information) on your online registration we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
            <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about security on our website, you can email us at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:support@socialtwist.com">support@socialtwist.com</a></p>
