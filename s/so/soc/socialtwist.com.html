<p><span class="privacyHeading">Cookies and Other Sites</span> When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called "cookies" on your computer.</p>

<p>We send a "session cookie" to your computer when you log in to your account. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don't need to ask you for your password on each page. Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect.</p>
<p>We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't need to retype the e-mail address each time you log in to your account.</p>
<p>We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="http://www.socialtwist.com">www.socialtwist.com</a> and we are not responsible for the privacy policies, practices or contents of any third party websites. Please refer to the privacy policies of such third party websites for information on what kinds of personally identifiable information such websites collect and their respective privacy practices, terms, and conditions.</p>
<p><span class="privacyHeading">Third Party Cookies</span>The use of cookies by our partners/affiliates is not covered by our privacy statement.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
<p><span class="privacyHeading">Widgets</span> Widgets support functions that require that you disclose certain personally identifiable information given the user's choice of participation. This information is collected in many different ways such as: forms, surveys, contests, forums, subscribing or unsubscribing to mailings and correcting or updating personally identifiable information and are only used for the purpose in which they were collected. Forms which require sensitive information such as financial information (credit card) to process purchases for products or services are SSL encrypted to protect your sensitive information.</p>

<p><span class="privacyHeading">Security</span>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card information) on your online registration we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
