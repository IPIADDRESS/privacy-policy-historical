<h1>Socialcam Privacy Notice</h1>
<p><i>Effective: Feb 1, 2012</i></p>
<p>Thank you for using the services
available through the Socialcam mobile application and the website at the domain
name Socialcam.com, each, that are provided by Socialcam, Inc. (the
“Socialcam Service”). At Socialcam, we strive to make your
online experience with us secure and satisfying. This Privacy Notice
describes and governs what information we gather from you, how we use that
information, and what we do to protect it. By using the Socialcam Service,
you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this
Policy. If you do not want information about you to be used in the manner
set forth in this Privacy Notice, please do not use the Socialcam Service.
This Privacy Notice is expressly incorporated into our Terms of Use.
Your use of the
Socialcam Service and any personal information you provide through the Socialcam
Service are subject to this Privacy Notice and the Terms of Use at all
times. </p>

<h2>Changes and Updates </h2>

<p>We may periodically revise this Privacy Notice. &nbsp;Please
revisit this page to stay current with
any changes. The most recent version of this Policy will always be
available on the Socialcam Service. The effective date of any changes will
be posted at the top of this page. For changes to this Privacy Notice that
may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal
information you have provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent
before implementing the change. Your continued use of the Socialcam
Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Notice and any future
revisions. </p>
<h2>Information Socialcam Collects</h2>
<p>Socialcam collects two types of data about users: (1)
information that you or others voluntarily submit to us (described below under
“User-Supplied Information”) and (2) technical data automatically
collected from all visitors to the Socialcam Service (described below under
“Automatically Collected Data”).</p>

<p><b>User-Supplied Information:</b> In using the
Socialcam Service, for example when you register with us, or if you send us an
email, you will provide Socialcam with data generally called “personally
identifiable” information. If you choose to provide such
information, you are giving Socialcam permission to use and store that
information consistent with this policy. Additionally, please know that
when you register or sign in to the Socialcam Service, you are not anonymous to
us. </p>
<ol>
<li><b>Mobile device information:</b> We may store your phone number,
as well as information
regarding your mobile device, including your mobile phone number, device type
and operating system and information in your mobile phone’s address book
or in other applications as permitted by the functionality of such mobile
device.</li>
<li><b>Profile Information:</b> To register for the Socialcam Service,
you will need to
provide access to the information on your Facebook account through Facebook
Connect. By doing so, you understand and authorize us to use all the information
exposed to us through Facebook Connect pursuant to this Privacy Notice,
including your status updates, photos, videos, name, email address and
information regarding your friends on Facebook. You should check your Facebook
settings to change the information sent to us through Facebook
Connect.</li>
<li><b>Location:</b> You may allow the
Socialcam mobile application to have access to your location to provide helpful
information and services based on where you are located (i.e., by allowing your
mobile device to send us your location).</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Automatically Collected Data:</b> The Socialcam Service
operating on a website automatically logs non-personally
identifiable information such as Internet Protocol address (“IP
Address”), a unique user ID, the content and pages that you access on the
Socialcam Service and the dates and times that you visit the Socialcam Service.
In addition, if you come to the Socialcam Service via a link from another
site, we may also track the source of that link.</p>

<p><b>Information Regarding “Cookies”:</b> Like many other
websites, the Socialcam Service may send one or more
cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters
– to your computer. Socialcam may use cookies to track user traffic
patterns as described above. Socialcam may use both session cookies and
persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your
browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may
be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Socialcam Service.
Persistent cookies can be removed. You can refuse cookies by turning
them off in your browser, however, some features on the Socialcam Service may
not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Please review your web
browser “Help” file to modify your cookie settings.</p>

<h2>Information we Obtain from Other Sources.</h2>
<p>We may collect information about you from other sources,
including from partners, and from commercially available sources (such as data
aggregators and public databases). The following are examples of information we
may collect from other sources:</p>

<ol>
<li>Data you authorize us to access through your use of
Facebook Connect.</li></ol>
<p>In general, the types
and amount of personally identifiable information we collect vary depending on
the activity. Socialcam endeavors to limit the collection of personally
identifiable information to information we believe is minimally necessary to
achieve our stated collection purposes. </p>
<h2>The Way Socialcam Uses Information</h2>

<p>Socialcam uses personally identifiable information
to establish and enhance our relationship with you. &nbsp;Socialcam may use the
information that you provide, or that we collect, to operate, maintain, enhance,
and deliver the various features and services found on the Socialcam Service; as
well as to track user-generated content and users to comply as a service
provider with the DMCA and other applicable laws.</p>

<p>Socialcam uses all of the information that we collect from users to
understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve
the way the Socialcam Service works and looks, and to create new features and
functionality.Further, Socialcam may use automatically collected data to:
(a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during
your visit or the next time you visit Socialcam; (b) monitor your participation
in various sections of the Socialcam Service; (c) customize our service to you,
including by providing you with recommendations and (c) monitor aggregate site
usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.
</p>

<p>We may use your e-mail address for administrative
communications such as notifying you of major Socialcam Service updates, for
customer service purposes, and to send privacy or security-related notices.</p>

<h2>How Socialcam May Disclose Information</h2>
<p>Socialcam does not
share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for
their marketing or promotional uses without
your prior consent.</p>

<p>We may share your
personally identifiable information with companies that provide services to us,
including outside vendors, contractors, or agents who help us manage our
business activities. Such entities only use your personal information in
accordance with this Privacy Notice and for no other purpose than to provide us
with necessary services.</p>

<p>Socialcam may
disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or
under the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state
and federal laws (including, without limitation, U.S. copyright or trademark
laws) or respond to a court order, subpoena, judicial or other governmental
requirement or warrant in a manner required by the requesting entity.
</p>
<p>Socialcam also reserves the right to disclose
personally identifiable information that we believe, in good faith, is
appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our
Terms of Use; protect
Socialcam from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to initiate, render, bill
and collect for amounts owed to Socialcam; to investigate and defend ourselves
against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement
agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Socialcam Service; or to
protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Socialcam, our Users, or
others. </p>

<p>In the event that Socialcam is acquired by, merged
with, or our assets are transferred to, another entity, such entity may be able
to use your personal information under the terms of this Privacy
Notice.</p>

<h2>Access to Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>If you register as a member of Socialcam, you may
update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time
by e-mailing us privacy-sc@Socialcam.com. To protect your privacy and
security, we take reasonable
steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making
corrections to your information. You are responsible for maintaining the
secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.
</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>Socialcam does not
knowingly collect or retain personally identifiable information about persons
under 13 years of age. Any person who provides their personal information
to Socialcam through this
website represents that they are 13 years of age or older. If Socialcam
learns that personally identifiable information of persons under the age of 13
years has been collected on the Socialcam Service without verifiable parental
consent, then Socialcam will take the appropriate steps to delete this
information. </p>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian and discover that
your child under the age of 13 has obtained a Socialcam Service account, then
you may alert Socialcam at privacy-sc@Socialcam.com and request that Socialcam
delete that child’s personal information from its systems.
</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>Socialcam uses commercially reasonable physical,
managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of
your personal information. However, no data transmissions over the
Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot, therefore, ensure
or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Socialcam, and you do
so at your own risk.  Please know that although we make our best efforts to
keep your information secure, this is not a guarantee that such information may
not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our
physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

<p>If Socialcam learns of a security systems breach, then we may
attempt to notify you
electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using
this website or providing personal information to us you agree that we can
communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and
administrative issues relating to your use of this website. Socialcam may
post a notice on the Socialcam Service if a security breach occurs.
Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice
of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a
security breach, or to opt out of receiving electronic notice you should notify
us at privacy-sc@Socialcam.com.</p>

<h2>International Visitors</h2>

<p>The Socialcam Service
is hosted in the United States. If you visit the Socialcam Service from
the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data
collection and use that may differ from laws of the United States, then please
understand that you are transferring your personally identifiable information
outside of those jurisdictions to the United States for the uses identified
above in accordance with this Privacy Notice. By providing your personally
identifiable information on the Socialcam Service you consent to that
transfer.</p>

<h2>Third Parties</h2>
<p>Except as expressly provided otherwise, this
document addresses only the use and disclosure of information that the Socialcam
Service collects from you or that you disclose to us. If you disclose your
information to others besides Socialcam different rules may apply to their use
or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Socialcam does not
control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the
privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you
to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>
