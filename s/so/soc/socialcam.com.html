Your continued use of the Socialcam Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Notice and any future revisions. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Information Socialcam Collects</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Socialcam collects two types of data about users: (1) information that you or others voluntarily submit to us (described below under “User-Supplied Information”) and (2) technical data automatically collected from all visitors to the Socialcam Service (described below under “Automatically Collected Data”).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c7">User-Supplied Information:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;In using the Socialcam Service, for example when you register with us, or if you send us an email, you will provide Socialcam with data generally called “personally identifiable” information. If you choose to provide such information, you are giving Socialcam permission to use and store that information consistent with this Privacy Notice. Additionally, please know that when you register or sign in to the Socialcam Service, you are not anonymous to us. </span></p><ol class="c3" start="1"><li class="c2 c6"><span class="c0 c7">Mobile device information:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;We may store your phone number, as well as information regarding your mobile device, including your mobile phone number, device type and operating system and information in your mobile phone’s address book or in other applications as permitted by the functionality of such mobile device.</span></li><li class="c2 c6"><span class="c0 c7">Profile Information:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;To register for the Socialcam Service, you will need to provide information through the online registration form on our website at Socialcam.com or to provide access to the information on your Facebook account through Facebook Connect.
