<font face="Verdana" color="#000000">


<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left">PRIVACY POLICY </p>
<p align="left">Social Bookmarking 101("SB101") strives to offer its visitors 
the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and 
personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your 
name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of 
this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to 
any unauthorized third party. Period."</p>
<p align="left">How we gather information from users</p>
<p align="left">How we collect and store information depends on the page you are 
visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services 
provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register 
for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as 
newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you 
participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and 
other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, SB101 also collects 
information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be 
transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet 
Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information 
from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and 
password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you 
visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular 
advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may 
also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose 
not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to 
refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain 
portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, 
and we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your 
preferences.</p>
<p align="left">What we do with the information we collect</p>
<p align="left">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance 
your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect 
your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p align="left">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally 
identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information 
about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to 
help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most 
or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally 
be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information 
does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow 
anyone to identify you individually.</p>
<p align="left">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on 
SB101 to communicate with you about your registration and customization 
preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products 
offered by SB101 and other topics we think you might find of interest.</p>
<p align="left">Personally Identifiable Information collected by SB101 may also 
be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, 
troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of 
sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third 
parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web 
hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your 
information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we 
continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other 
companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the 
transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court 
order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by 
law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to 
law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please 
note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
<p align="left">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</p>
<p align="left">SB101 expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to 
respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, 
including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers 
accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection 
policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link 
to, or view as part of a frame on a SB101 page, certain content that is actually 
created or hosted by a third party. Also, through SB101 you may be introduced 
to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or 
sweepstakes offered by other parties. SB101 is not responsible for the actions 
or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy 
policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page 
operated by a third party</p>
<p align="left">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or 
other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify 
some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of 
our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable 
the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement 
before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by 
third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. 
SB101 does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the 
resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of 
such third parties.</p>
<p align="left">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose 
Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that 
information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third 
parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other 
individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of SB101 
and this policy.</p>
<p align="left">Children</p>
<p align="left">SB101 does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally 
Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by 
law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in 
violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you 
believe SB101 has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact 
us at the address listed below.</p>
<p align="left">Contacting Us.</p>
<p align="left">We can be reached by contacting:</p>

<p align="left">Changes to this Policy</p>
<p align="left">SB101 reserves the right to change this policy at any time. 
Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site 
following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those 
changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be 
used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information 
was collected.</p>
<p align="left">Governing law</p>
<p align="left">This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Florida 
law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it 
with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: 
Crestview, Florida. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with 
the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</p>
<p align="left">If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory 
solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding 
arbitration at the following location: Crestview, FL under the rules of the 
American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the 
arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p align="left">SB101 is controlled, operated and administered entirely within 
Florida. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and 
do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any 
party.</p>
