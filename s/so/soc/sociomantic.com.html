<p><em>sociomantic labs</em> takes the privacy and security of your data very seriously. This policy outlines the privacy practices of our web domain, <a href="http://www.sociomantic.com,/">www.sociomantic.com,</a> as well as the privacy practices associated with our online advertising technologies. As a company located in the Federal Republic of Germany, we comply with some of the most stringent web privacy laws in the world. We also adhere to the industry’s <em><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising</a></em>.</p>
<p>This policy is effective as of 1 August, 2010.<br>
Last updated: 8 November, 2010</p>
<p><strong id="website-privacy-policy">Website Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>This section outlines the privacy practices with regards to our website, <a href="../" target="_blank">www.sociomantic.com</a> and all related domains.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)</strong><br>
We collect PII (such as your name, email address, or phone number) when      you provide it to us for the purposes of communication with the company      (e.g., by using our <a href="../contact/" target="_blank">contact form</a> or commenting on <a href="http://blog.sociomantic.com/">our blog</a>). When we receive this information, we use it to      respond to your inquiry, request, or comment, and then we store the      information for a reasonable time to complete correspondence and keep a      record of communications.We do not combine your PII with the non-PII data we store in our <em>sociomantic</em> Sonar or third party cookies      (more below). We will never share your PII with non-affiliate third      parties unless obligated by the national law of the Federal Republic of Germany      or international governance.<p></p>
<p>If you would like to update or delete the PII we have on file, please feel      free to <a title="privacy email" href="javascript:Transpose_Email('privacy','sociomantic.com','');">email us.</a></p></li>
<li><strong>Anonymous data (non-PII)</strong><br>
Our website, <a href="../" target="_blank">www.sociomantic.com</a>, places small text files on your internet      browser called <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">cookies</a>. Cookies      store non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) about your web      browsing behaviors both on our site and after you leave our site. We use cookies      for three purposes:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">I) <em>Website Customization:</em> these cookies can remember your preferences (e.g., your login status on our customer pages) to make your experience with our website more personalized and streamlined.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">II) <em>Website Analytics:</em> these third party cookies help us analyze our web traffic to improve the effectiveness of our website. They collect information such as your browser type, when you came to our site and which pages were visited, and what country you’re browsing from.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">III) <em>Online Advertising:</em> these are our <em>sociomantic</em> Sonar cookies, which enable us to serve you more relevant advertisements as you surf the web. They collect information such as the websites you visit after you leave our site and your clickstream activity on those sites. (More details in the following section.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In all three cases, we may share this anonymous data with third parties. Read the “Controlling the use of your information” section below to learn about how you can manage your cookie preferences.</p>
<p><strong id="online-advertising-privacy-policy">Online Advertising Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Our technology helps our clients to deliver more relevant online advertisements using a range of ad targeting methods that depend on cookies to aggregate data about user behaviors on the web. If you’re interested in learning more about how these technologies work, we’d recommend starting at these sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>IABEurope’s <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">Your Online Choices</a> site (EU)</li>
<li>IAB’s <a href="http://www.iab.net/privacymatters/" target="_blank">Privacy Matters</a> site (learn about online behavioral advertising)</li>
<li>Digital Advertising Alliance’s <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/" target="_blank">AboutAds</a> site (U.S.-based self-regulatory initiative)</li>
</ul>
<p>The information we aggregate is never attached to or combined with any PII without user consent, and is delivered anonymously and securely to our partners and clients for the purposes of online advertising. If you are not interested in seeing more relevant online advertisements delivered by our technology, please scroll down to the “<strong>Cookie Control</strong>” or “<strong>Opt Out</strong>” sections below to learn about how you can control the collection and use of non-PII for your browser.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Types of anonymous information collected<br>
</strong>Our targeting technology      collects only non-PII data. &nbsp;This anonymous data is stored as small      files (<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">cookies</a>) that are      saved to your web browser to help us collect information such the websites      visited by your browser, the advertisements clicked, items viewed in an      online shop or added to an online shopping basket, etc. We also collect      information on the performance of the ads delivered, for example how many      times an ad was shown, whether or not it was clicked, or if that click      resulted in an online purchase.</li>
<li><strong>How is information used?</strong><br>
The information we collect is used to help make the ads you see more      relevant to you. We do this by showing you ads based on your previous      online actions and other dimensions we have assigned to your browser based      on the non-PII we have collected. This helps to reduce the amount of      “spam” advertisements you see as you browse the web, and it enables      advertisers to connect to people who would be most interested in their      offering. It also helps web publishers to make more money from the ad      spaces they have to sell, so they can continue to offset their production      costs and provide valuable content to you – many times for free.</li>
<li><strong>Storage and retention of data<strong> </strong></strong><em><br>
sociomantic labs</em> has taken reasonable measures to encrypt and keep secure the all of the data we collect. This data is stored for a finite amount of time within the bounds of German law and in compliance with international standards.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong id="controlling-the-use-of-your-information">Controlling the Use of Your Information</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Disclosure of information to third parties </strong><br>
We will never share your PII with non-affiliate third parties without your      consent. Non-PII data collected by our technologies may be shared with our      clients and partners for the purposes of delivering targeted online      advertisements or aggregated user insights.&nbsp; The provision of your      personal data to government institutions is only possible within the      framework of the national law of the Federal Republic of Germany or in      compliance with international governance.</li>
<li><strong>Children</strong><br>
We never knowingly collect personal information about users under the age      of 13 or from pages targeted to users of this age group. In the event that      it is brought to our attention that personal information about a person under the      age of 13 has been collected, we will take reasonable measures to remove      this information from our system.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive information<br>
</strong>We never collect sensitive      information such as financial account numbers, Social Security numbers,      pharmaceutical prescriptions, or medical records.</li>
<li><strong>Cookie Control</strong><br>
Most modern web browsers give users the option to control the placement of      cookies and/or to delete cookies which have been acquired while browsing      the web. You can access these options in the preferences or options      section of your web browser.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong id="how-to-opt-out">Opt-out</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to opt-out of <em>sociomantic</em>’s Sonar tracking you can do so by selecting the checkbox below. This places a new cookie on your browser that tells our technology to refrain from collecting any further non-PII data about you. Please take note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict your cookies via browser controls, or if you use another browser or another computer, you may need to renew your opt-out decision.</p>
