			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Other than as set out in this privacy policy, we will not disclose, sell or rent personal data about you or your users to any third party unless you have consented to this. If you do consent but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, if a third party acquires all (or substantially all) of our business and/or assets, we may disclose personal data about you and your users to that third party in connection with the acquisition.
