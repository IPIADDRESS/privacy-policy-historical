          <p>We (or third party data processors acting on our behalf) may collect, store and use personal data listed above relating to you and your users for the following purposes:</p>
          <p>to make the Services available to you and to provide you and your users with content which is tailored to your or their individual tastes; to complete any purchases you or your users make through the Services and to provide services that you or they request; to further develop and improve the Services; to maintain and support any customer account that you have with us; to include (or to permit the inclusion of) advertising within the Services of our own and third party products, services and promotions that we or they think may interest you; where we have obtained consent from you or your users, to contact you or them (as applicable) with products, services and promotions (including by SMS and e-mail) which we think may interest you or them; and where we have obtained consent from you or your users, to disclose your or their (as applicable) personal data to carefully chosen third parties so that they may contact you or them with products, services and promotions (including by SMS and e-mail) which they think may interest you or them.</p>
          <p>Other than as set out in this privacy policy, we will not disclose, sell or rent personal data about you or your users to any third party unless you have consented to this. If you do consent but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity.</p>
          <p>However, if a third party acquires all (or substantially all) of our business and/or assets, we may disclose personal data about you and your users to that third party in connection with the acquisition.</p>
          <p>We may also disclose personal data about you and your users where we are required to do so by applicable law, by order of a court, by a governmental body or by a law enforcement agency. We may also disclose personal data about you and your users in the context of investigating or reporting any issue arising in connection with activity by you or them or content supplied or purporting to be supplied by you or them, to you or them or on your or their behalf that we reasonably believe could be unlawful or otherwise in breach of our terms of service.</p>
