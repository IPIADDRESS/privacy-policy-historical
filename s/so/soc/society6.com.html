European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact us at [**legal@leafgroup.com**](mailto:legal@leafgroup.com).\n\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the  **BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD** , a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by BBB National Programs, Inc. (BBB NP). If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [**http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/**](http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/) for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.\n\nIf your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.  See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at [https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction)\n\n**7. California Residents**\n\nIf you are a California resident under the age of 18 and are a registered user of the Services, you may request that we remove content or information about you that you posted on the Services by: (a) submitting a request in writing to [**legal@leafgroup.com**](mailto:legal@leafgroup.com); and (b) clearly identifying the content or information you wish to have removed and providing sufficient information to allow us to locate the content or information to be removed. However, please note that we are not required to, and may not be able to, erase or otherwise eliminate content or information if: (i) other state or federal laws require us or a third party to maintain the content or information; (ii) the content or information was posted, stored, or republished by another user; (iii) the content or information is anonymized so that you cannot be individually identified; (iv) you do not follow the instructions posted in this Privacy Policy on how to request removal of your content or information; or (v) you have received compensation or other consideration for providing the content. Further, nothing in this provision shall be construed to limit the authority of a law enforcement agency to obtain the applicable content or information.\n\n**8. The Privacy of Children**\n\nThe Services are not intended for children under age 16. We do not knowingly collect or distribute personal information from or about children under the age of 16. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [**legal@leafgroup.com**](mailto:legal@leafgroup.com).\n\n**9. Security Measures and Storage Limits**\n\nWe provide industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal data we process and maintain. For example, we take reasonable measures to limit access to this data to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for data we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches. As a result, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Services and you do so at your own risk.\n\nOur retention periods for personal data are based on our business needs and legal requirements. We retain personal data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was collected, and any other permissible, related purpose. For example, we may retain certain transaction details and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. When personal data is no longer needed, we either irreversibly anonymize the data (and we may further retain and use the anonymized information) or securely destroy the data.\n\n**10. Updates to this Privacy Policy**\n\nWe will notify you of material changes to this Privacy Policy by at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes. If you do not agree to such changes following such notice, you should discontinue your use of the Services prior to the time the modified privacy policy takes effect. If you continue using the Services after the modified privacy policy takes effect, you will be bound by the modified privacy policy.\n\n**11. Contact Us**\n\nIf you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at [**legal@leafgroup.com**](mailto:legal@leafgroup.com) or send a letter to:\n\n**Leaf Group Ltd.**\n\n**Attn: Legal Department**\n\n**1655 26th Street**\n\n**Santa Monica, CA 90404**\n\nWe will do our best to respond to you in a timely and professional manner to answer your questions and resolve your concerns.","id":"75d0deed-be68-4ba2-83bd-af32ed5b2a08"}],"auxiliaryFields":[{"name":"Single Column Textarea","fields":[{"type":"textAreaInput","key":"singleColumnTextArea","label":"Markdown
