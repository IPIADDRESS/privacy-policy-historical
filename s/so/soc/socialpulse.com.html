  <p class="text1">About 
              AlstraSoft E-Friends and the Information We Collect <br>
              AlstraSoft E-Friends is an online social networking community that connects 
              people through networks of friends for dating or making new friends. 
              To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles which are 
              shown to the people in their personal network. A personal network 
              consists of a user?s friends as well as the extended group of people 
              that a user is connected to via chains of mutual friends. To fulfill 
              the purpose of this site, some personal information we ask for is 
              displayed to people within these personal networks. </p>
            <p class="text1">Information Collected/Tracked 
              by AlstraSoft E-Friends </p>
            <p class="text1">Information submitted to AlstraSoft E-Friends </p>
            <p class="text1">AlstraSoft E-Friends collects user-submitted

            AlstraSoft E-Friends 
              also collects user-submitted profile information such as gender, 
              age, occupation, location, etc. </p>
            <p class="text1">Information not Directly Submitted 
              by Users to AlstraSoft E-Friends </p>
            <p class="text1">This is information we collect 
              that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP

              community where users can meet new people through their friends.

              via email to join the service, when a user requests to add another 
              user to their friend list, and when we send notifications to a user 
              related to their use of the service. Except when inviting or adding 
              friends, a user's email address is not shared or displayed with 
              people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal 
              network communicate on AlstraSoft E-Friends with each other through the 
              AlstraSoft E-Friends service, without disclosing email addresses. We may 
              also use a user's email address to send weekly updates or news regarding

            <p class="text1">Use of Cookies </p>
            <p class="text1">A cookie is a piece of data 
              stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. 
              We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session 
              ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. 
              A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard 
              drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be 
              removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Cookies 
              are used to manage sessions on our site. Users must enable cookies 
              to use our site. Also, users may optionally use a cookie to remember 
              their password in order to automatically log in to our site. We 
              do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from 
              any user which they did not intentionally submit to us. </p>
            <p class="text1">Correcting/Updating or Removing 
              Information </p>

            <p class="text1">If we change our privacy policy, 
              we will post those changes on our web site so our users are always 
              aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
              circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use users' 
              personally identifiable information in a manner different from that 
              stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. </p>
            <p class="text1">Invite a Friend </p>
            <p class="text1">If a user elects to use our 
              Invite feature to invite a friend to our site, we ask them for the 
              friend's email address. AlstraSoft E-Friends will automatically send the 
              friend an email inviting them to join the site. AlstraSoft 
            E-Friends stores 
              this email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondant 
              to the friends list of the user sending the invitation, and also 
              to send reminders of the invitation. AlstraSoft E-Friends does not sell 
              these email addresses or use them to send any other communication 
              besides invitations and invitation reminders. The friend may contact

              database. </p>

              can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal
