<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your “personal data” (as defined in such applicable laws).  To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To honor our contractual commitments to you:  Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users’ requests in anticipation of entering into a contract with them.  For example, we handle personal data on this basis to provide you access to or a an account to the SoundBetter Platform.</li>
  <li>To enable and facilitate transactions and agreements between SoundBetter members</li>
  <li>Consent:  Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of your implied or express consent.</li>
  <li>Legitimate interests:  In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in commercial activities in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals.  This includes: operating our business and the Platform; providing security for the Platform, products, software, or applications; marketing; making and receiving payments; and preventing fraud.</li>
  <li>Legal compliance:  We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations (such as our obligation to share data with tax authorities).</li>
</ul>

For users who are EU residents or may otherwise be covered by GDPR, we are in the process of finalizing an “opt in” procedure and will update this policy once that procedure is in place.  In the meantime, if you are an EU resident and you receive a communication which you believe we should not have sent to you, please immediately notify us through the procedure set forth in the preceding sentence and we will not contact you with offers, promotions or marketing materials in the future.

<p>Note that if you choose not to receive offers, promotional materials or marketing communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as security alerts and notices related to your access to or use of our Platform or related services, or those about your online account or our ongoing business relations.</p>

If you use our Platform, you are responsible for restricting access to your computer or connected devices, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, or remove or edit content in our sole discretion.</p>

<p>We use reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help us protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of data stored on our system that are designed reasonably to protect information contained within our systems from loss, misuse or alteration, although information you submit on or through the Platform may not be encrypted. Access to your information and account activity is restricted to those providing required credentials and who have a need for access, such as our system administrators, support staff or contractors. Payment processing is provided through third parties who are responsible for the protection of your payment information.

If there is information that you wish to protect from disclosure to others, do not provide it to us.</p>

<h3>Data Subject Rights</h3>

<p>Residents of the EU can exercise certain data subject rights available to them under applicable data protection laws.  Where such rights apply, we will comply with requests to exercise these rights in accordance with applicable law.  Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation.  If these rights apply to you, they may permit you to request that we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Obtain access to or a copy of certain personal data we hold about you</li>

  <li>Restrict the way that we process and disclose specific personal data about you</li>
  <li>Transfer your personal data to a third-party provider of services</li>
  <li>Revoke consent that you previously provided for the processing of your personal data</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on how to exercise these rights, contact us using the information in the “Contacting Us” section below.  If applicable, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the country where you are based. Alternatively, you may seek a remedy through local courts if you believe your rights have been breached.</p>

<h3>Retention of Your Information</h3>

<p>We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.</p>

<h3>Consent to Processing</h3>

<p>Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the country where it was collected as well as other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding data protection may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By using the Platform and by providing any Personal Information to us or by posting Personal Information on or through the Platform, all users, including without limitation users in Canada and the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in the United States.</p>

<p>SoundBetter is currently in the process of self-certifying to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Protocols.  We will post a new policy including all mandatory Privacy Shield terms and conditions as soon as we receive approval from the Federal Trade Commission.  Until then, we will follow the principles and terms of Privacy Shield when it comes to your personal information and how we use it.</p>

<p>Where required, we will use appropriate safeguards when transferring your data outside of EU.  For more information about these safeguards, please contact us as detailed in the “Contacting Us” section below.</p>

<h3>GDPR Compliance</h3>

<p>If you are a user residing in the EU and covered by GDPR, we will provide a systematic approach to managing your personal information through our people, management processes and information systems by applying a risk management methodology that is consistent with and in furtherance of the fundamental principles of GDPR.  For more information on our GDPR compliance program, feel free to contact us at privacy@soundbetter.com</p>

<h3>Protecting Children’s Privacy</h3>

<p>The Platform is not designed nor intended for use by children under the age of 18 (“Minors”). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from Minors. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any information to us.</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect data from European Union residents under the age of consent set by applicable data protection law. If we learn that we are processing data of such an individual, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable data from our records.</p>

<h3>Do Not Track</h3>

<p>Our Site, Services, applications or other offerings do not respond to Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations, and solutions.</p>

<h3>Contacting Us</h3>
