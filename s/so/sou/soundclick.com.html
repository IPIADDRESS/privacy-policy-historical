<div class="contentH1">Privacy Statement</div>
<div class="content">
	SoundClick is committed to protecting your privacy online. We are also committed to providing you with the very best experience we can on our Web site. In order to enhance your experience at our site we gather 
	certain personal information about you that helps us customize our content to your tastes and preferences. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make 
    full use of our Web site. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.
</div>
<div class="contentH2">What information do we collect?</div>
<div class="content">
	SoundClick collects information in several ways from different parts of our Web site. SoundClick collects some personal information when you initially sign up for some of our services. We may ask for your name, 
	e-mail address, zip code, and country. The more information you share with us (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to enhance and customize your experience on our site.
</div>
<div class="content">
	In addition to the former information, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you make a purchase through our online store, when you enter promotions 
	or contests and when you respond to a survey. For example, when you make a purchase through our online store, we collect several items of personal information, including your billing and shipping address, 
    telephone number, credit card information, PayPal account email, and any other information necessary to complete the transaction. For your security, we never store credit card information on our servers. 
    We transmit credit card information directly to the third party credit card processor through secure connections, and PayPal-related information directly to PayPal. You may find out more about
    <a href="https://www.paypal.com/va/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">PayPal's privacy policy</a> on their linked privacy policy page.

    how you've used our site or services, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, your browser type and operating system, device information, device event information (e.g., crashes, browser type), 
    and the page you've viewed or engaged with before or after using our site or services.
