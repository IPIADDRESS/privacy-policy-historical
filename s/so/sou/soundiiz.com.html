                <p class="text-default-2 text-justify">
                    This privacy policy is for this website <a href="https://soundiiz.com">Soundiiz.com</a> and served by BRICKOFT and governs the privacy of its users who choose to use it.

                    The policy sets out the different areas where user privacy is concerned and outlines the obligations &amp; requirements of the users, the website and website owners. Furthermore the way this website processes, stores and protects user data and information will also be detailed within this policy.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-turquoise">The Website</h2>
                <p class="text-default-2 text-justify">
                    This website and its owners take a proactive approach to user privacy and ensure the necessary steps are taken to protect the privacy of its users throughout their visiting experience.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-turquoise">About the converter</h2>
                <p class="text-default-2 text-justify">
                    When you log on the streaming platform of Soundiiz, we ask you some questions to collect information.<br>
                    To convert your playlists, <b>we need to access to your playlist (public and private) and, sometimes, to your identification information</b> such as your email (to call API).<br>
                    We also need to have <b>your approval to rename or delete your playlist</b> because Soundiiz can directly do it via the converter.<br><br>

                <b>We do not keep any information about you</b> in our database when you use the playlists converter. We only keep <b>some figures</b> about the conversion in order to improve our service (numbers of tracks, titles ...).<br>
                And when we ask you to give your user name to access to a service, <b>we do not keep it either</b>. This is why you need to rewrite it when you come back.<br><br>
