<h3>
<a name="information-from-other-sources"></a>Information from Other Sources</h3>

<p>SoundCloud allows you to sign up and log in using your Facebook account.  If you sign up using Facebook, Facebook will ask your permission to share certain information from your Facebook account with SoundCloud.  This includes your first name, last name, gender, general location, a link to your Facebook profile, your timezone, birthday, profile picture, your "likes" and your list of friends.</p>

<p>This information is collected by Facebook and is provided to us under the terms of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">Facebook’s privacy policy</a>. You can control the information that we receive from Facebook using the privacy settings in your Facebook account.</p>

<p>If you sign up to SoundCloud® using Facebook, your SoundCloud® account will be connected automatically to your Facebook account, and information regarding your activity on SoundCloud®, specifically any new public sounds that you post on SoundCloud® and any new favourites, will be shared with Facebook and will be published in your timeline and your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds.  If you do not wish to share your SoundCloud® activity with your Facebook friends, you can control this from the Settings page on the Website – for more information, see the <a href="#choice-and-control">Choice and Control</a> section below.  If you signed up using Facebook by mistake, you can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings at any time, or you can email us at <a href="mailto:&lt;a%20href='mailto:privacy@soundcloud.com'&gt;privacy@soundcloud.com&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="mailto:privacy@soundcloud.com">privacy@soundcloud.com</a>.</p>

<p>We use the information that we collect about you for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your email address and password are used to identify you when you log into the Platform.</p></li>
<li><p>Any additional information that you provide as part of your public profile, such as your real name, and links to your website and other social media profiles (but not your email address), will be published on your profile page.

<li><p>If you are a Facebook user and sign up using Facebook, we may also use the information we receive about you from Facebook to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on SoundCloud®.  It will be up to you if you choose to follow these users and you can unfollow them at any time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your personal information is also used for the following general purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of the Apps and any Services that you may request from time to time.</p></li>
<li><p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other contributions that you make to the Platform.</p></li>

<h2>
<a name="sharing-of-your-personal-information"></a>Sharing of your personal information</h2>

<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy (including our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">Cookies Policy</a>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages.  If you listen to any sounds uploaded by a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they can track the popularity of their sounds.  Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments will be available to all users of the Platform.</p></li>
<li><p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so.  We will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p></li>
<li><p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform.  These third parties will have access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide their services to us.  Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p></li>
<li><p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the Platform into exciting new apps.  Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic Area.  Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers.  Please bear this in mind when deciding what information to publish on your profile.  For information on how to limit the information that is available over the API, please see the <a href="#choice-and-control">Choice and Control</a> section below.</p></li>
<li><p>Other networks and connected apps:  If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social networks such as Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or networks.  In the case of Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post on SoundCloud® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and friends on those networks.  In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or repost sounds from within the app.  This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private sounds.  SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or services that you trust.  For information on how to control the information that your share, and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the <a href="#choice-and-control">Choice and Control</a> section below.</p></li>
<li><p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third parties or make publicly available.

<h2>
<a name="cookies-and-similar-technology"></a>Cookies and similar technology</h2>

<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the Website and the Apps and Services we provide.  We have included information about our use of cookies and similar technology in a separate <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">Cookies Policy</a> that forms part of this Privacy Policy.  The Cookies Policy also includes information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>

<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar technology.  <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other technologies as described in our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">Cookies Policy</a>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>

<h2>
<a name="choice-and-control"></a>Choice and Control</h2>

<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to us, and the control you have over that information.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above).  However, if you do decide to register a SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>

<h3>
<a name="email-preferences"></a>Email preferences</h3>

<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website.  When you are logged in to your account, you can access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop down menu.</p>

<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>

<ul>
<li>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</li>
<li>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings.  This will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>

<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications) at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>

<h3>
<a name="sharing-with-other-apps-and-networks"></a>Sharing with other apps and networks</h3>

<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other networks and applications.  As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>

<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook account will be connected automatically, and information regarding the public sounds that you post or favourite on SoundCloud®, will be shared with Facebook and will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. <br><strong>If you do not want this information shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>

<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the activities of those sites or applications.  You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or applications.</p>

<h3>
<a name="sharing-with-other-users"></a>Sharing with other users</h3>

<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website.  By checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>

<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds).  By setting your sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>

<h3>
<a name="sharing-with-app-developers"></a>Sharing with app developers</h3>

<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of the Platform.  If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload.  Click on the pencil icon in the waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page.  Please note that your public profile information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>

<h3>
<a name="cookies"></a>Cookies</h3>

<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">Cookies Policy</a>.  Further information is available at <a href="http://aboutcookies.org"></a><a href="http://aboutcookies.org">http://aboutcookies.org</a></p>

<h3>
<a name="app-preferences"></a>App preferences</h3>

<p>You can use the settings within our iOS and Android apps to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting.  Simply go to the settings screen on your iOS or Android device, and disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting information being sent from the app.  Further information is available in our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="deleting-your-account"></a>Deleting your account</h3>

<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time.  Please bear in mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable.  You are therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>

<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages.  Search engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>

<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account.  If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account tab in your Settings on the Website.  Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app.  You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third party app.</p>

<h2>
<a name="access-to-your-data"></a>Access to your Data</h2>

<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings page of your SoundCloud® account.  If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:&lt;a%20href='mailto:privacy@soundcloud.com'&gt;privacy@soundcloud.com&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="mailto:privacy@soundcloud.com">privacy@soundcloud.com</a>, or the address provided below.</p>

<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>

<h2>
<a name="international-data-transfers"></a>International data transfers</h2>

<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance with European laws.  However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the United States.  You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>

If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information as quickly as possible.  If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:&lt;a%20href='mailto:privacy@soundcloud.com'&gt;privacy@soundcloud.com&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="mailto:privacy@soundcloud.com">privacy@soundcloud.com</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="changes-and-updates-to-this-privacy-policy"></a>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out below.  Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information.  Please be sure to check back here from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy.  Any material changes to this Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of the change on the Website.</p>
