<p>When using the Services, we may ask you to provide us with Personal Information. SoundExchange may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information. If we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected by Automated Means</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We collect certain usage information about our website, such as the number and frequency of visitors to certain parts of the website (“Usage Information”). Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if SoundExchange associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, SoundExchange treats it as Personal Information.<br>
SoundExchange may provide aggregate statistics about Usage Information or demographic information with third-parties, but this information will not include Personal Information.<br>
In the course of collecting Usage Information, SoundExchange also may automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “Device”) you use to access the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. When you visit the Services, we may view your Device Identifier. We use this information to improve your experience on the Services, to enhance our Services, and to protect the Services.<br>
The technologies used on the Services to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include without limitation, cookies. Cookies are data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Services. SoundExchange may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to tell us whether you have visited the Services before, if you are a new visitor or to otherwise facilitate site navigation, and to personalize your experience while visiting our Services. Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our Services, and pages visited. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular Service. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) to disable existing cookies; or (iii) to set your browser to automatically reject any cookies.  However, please be aware that if you disable or reject cookies, some features and services on our Services may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your profile.<br>

<b>Use of Personal Information</b></p>

From time to time, SoundExchange participates in political advocacy regarding important intellectual property ownership and performance rights. We may send you emails to seek your involvement and assistance in campaign activities, such as signing petitions or surveys, or sending emails including your information to political representatives. If you have questions about, or would like to opt out of, one or more of the ways SoundExchange plans to use your Personal Information or keep you up to date about its operations, activities and services, please send an email to: account_services@soundexchange.com.

In any of these circumstances, we disclose Personal Information only to the extent it is necessary, and we further require that the third party maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information. SoundExchange does not otherwise share, nor does it sell, trade or rent, your Personal Information to third parties.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<strong>Links to Other Sites</strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Services may provide links to other websites that we do not own or operate.  To the extent that any linked websites are not part of the Services, we do not control, recommend or endorse and are not responsible for these websites or their content, products, services, or privacy policies or practices.

<b>Visitors Under the Age of 13</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SoundExchange does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13.

<p>&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Consent to Processing and Transfer of Information</strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Services are operated in the United States. Given that we are an international business, our use of your information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Services or providing us with any information, you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be comprehensive as or equivalent to, those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In addition, Personal Information collected and processed by SoundExchange will also be transferred to third parties that operate performer databases (e.g., the International Performers Database (“IPD”), operated by the Societies’ Council for the Collective Management of Performers’ Rights (“SCAPR”) on behalf of its members). The IPD will be accessible for the purposes of the identification of performers necessary for an effective administration of neighboring rights and other intellectual property rights of performers.  Such data will also be transferred inside and outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and countries outside the EEA may employ a level of data protection which is different or less than the level of data protection within the EEA. The processing of personal data in the context of the IPD is subject to the data protection laws of Belgium, and affected individuals have the legal rights conferred to them by the data protection laws of Belgium.<br>
