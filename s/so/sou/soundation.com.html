<p>1. Introduction<br>
Thank you for choosing to use our service and a special thanks for taking the time to thoroughly read through this Privacy Policy. We would like to begin with a short summary explaining why we have created this policy. Our fundamental objectives are to:<br>
Give you a brief introduction to personal data;<br>
Explain why we handle certain kinds of personal information;<br>
Ensure that you understand what information we gather and what we actually do with said information;  <br>
Show you how we work to protect your rights and your integrity.<br>
Our goal is that you, after having read this policy, will feel secure in that your personal integrity is respected and that your personal data is treated in a correct manner. We therefore also work on a continuous basis with securing that our treatment of personal data is completely in compliance with current legislation, especially the General Data Protection Regulation (<span class="caps">GDPR</span>) which will be in effect as of May the 25th, 2018.</p>
<p>2. What is personal data and what does the processing of personal data mean? <br>
2.1 Personal data consists of all information that directly, or indirectly together with other information, can be connected to a living (physical) person. A non-exhaustive list with examples of personal data consists of, among others:<br>
Name<br>
Personal ID number<br>
Email-address<br>
IP-address<br>
Pictures and video</p>

<p>3. For whom is this policy applicable? <br>
This Privacy Policy shall in the first instance be applicable to individuals who are users of our Services and from whom we collect and process personal data (”Data Subjects”). Different parts of this Privacy Policy may also be relevant to you depending on your relationship with us. All in all, this policy is relevant for persons who: <br>
are customers or users of ours – when handling your account in order to provide you with the best possible user experience<br>
visit our website or our social media platforms<br>
otherwise communicate with us, for example through our customer service<br>
By agreeing to this Privacy Policy you agree to our processing of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>4. For what areas is this policy applicable? <br>
This Privacy Policy regulates how we may collect and process personal data to be able to continue delivering and developing our Services.</p>
<p>5. What does it mean to be a Data Controller?<br>
A Data Controller is a legal person or other entity that determines the purpose and means for the processing of personal data. A corporation is a Data Controller in regards to personal data it has for its own benefit in regards to its employees, customers, partners, users and others.</p>
<p>6. Soundation as a Data Controller<br>
We, Soundation AB (company reg. no. 556561-6629) are the Data Controller and therefore accountable in accordance with applicable legislation, for the processing that occurs with your personal data, within the scope of our Services.</p>
<p>7. Why are we allowed to process personal data?<br>
7.1 For it to be permissible for us to process personal data there must always be support for said treatment within the <span class="caps">GDPR</span>, so-called lawful basis. Such lawful basis may include: <br>
Consent from the Data Subject.<br>
That the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill the terms of an agreement with the Data Subject, for example in relation to the use of the Services.<br>
Fulfilling a legal obligation, for example storing certain information due to legislation regarding certain accounting standards and practices. This could also be the case when handling opt-out settings requests concerning your rights as a Data Subject in accordance with <span class="caps">GDPR</span>.<br>
A weighing of interests when we have a legitimate interest in using your data, for example for statistical purposes and to market our services, and to secure payment and prevent fraud.<br>
7.2 It may occur that the same personal data is processed both through support in terms of fulfilling an agreement as well as in terms of specific consent or in terms of the processing of that specific information is necessary to fulfill other legal obligations. This means that even though you may revoke your consent and the treatment based on said consent ceases, that specific personal data may remain with us for separate reasons.</p>

<p>10. Our actions to protect personal data<br>
10.1 We have ensured that we have taken all necessary and appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal data against loss, misuse or unauthorized access. <br>
10.2 To technically ensure that personal data is processed in a safe and confidential manner we use digital networks that are breach protected through for example encryption, firewalls, and password protection. In any instance where a breach may occur we have created routines to identify, assess and minimize any damage that may occur as well as inform said damage to all affected parties.<br>
10.3 To ensure an adequate knowledge level regarding the processing of personal data we will arrange ongoing educational efforts regarding <span class="caps">GDPR</span>, both for our employees as well as the consultants that may from time to another be contracted to do work for us.</p>
<p>11. When do we share personal data? <br>
11.1 We will not sell, make available or spread personal data to third parties with the exception of what is stated throughout this Privacy Policy. Within the scope of the Services, personal data may be shared with subcontractors or partners, if this is necessary for the fulfillment and performance of our Services, for example, to process your payments. In any instance where we choose to share personal data we will enter into a Data Processing Agreement to ensure that the recipient of the personal data processes said information in accordance with applicable legislation as well as to ensure that the recipient has taken the necessary technical and organizational actions to, in a satisfactory fashion, be able to protect the rights and freedoms of you as a Data Subject.<br>
11.2 Furthermore we may share personal data if we are required to do so by law, court order or if withholding such personal data would hinder an ongoing legal investigation.</p>
<p>12. Your rights<br>
12.1 We are responsible for your personal data being processed in accordance with applicable legislation. <br>
12.2 Upon your request, or at our own initiative, we will correct, de-identify, delete or complete any information that has been found to be wrongful, incomplete or misleading. <br>
12.3 You have the right to demand access to your personal data. This means that you have the right to demand transcripts regarding the processing that we have maintained over your personal data. You also have the right to receive a copy of the personal data that are being processed. You have the right to, once a year and through written application, without cost receive a transcript regarding what personal data is stored in regards to you, the purpose of the storage and processing as well as to whom said information has been made accessible. You also have, within the transcripts, the right to be informed of the period of time in which the personal data will be stored and what criteria we have used to determine that period of time. <br>
12.4 You have the right of correction of your personal data. We will, upon your request and as quickly as possible correct the incorrect or incomplete personal data we process in regards to you. <br>
12.5 You have the right to demand deletion of your personal data. This means that you have the right to demand that your personal data is removed if it is no longer necessary for the objectives for which it was gathered. There may exist legal requirements stating that we may not immediately delete personal data (for example in terms of auditing and taxation related legislation). We will in any such case cease the processing being done for any other reasons than to adhere to the legislation of <span class="caps">GDPR</span>.<br>
12.6 You have the right to object to any processing of personal data that is carried out on a lawful basis of weighing of interests. If you object to such processing we will only continue the processing if there are legitimate reasons for the processing that outweigh your interests.<br>
12.7 You have the right to report our processing of your personal data to any public authority responsible for monitoring the application of the <span class="caps">GDPR</span>, for example, The Swedish Data Protection Authority in Sweden. However, we do recommend that you contact us first so that we can try solving the matter in a more efficient and timely manner.</p>
