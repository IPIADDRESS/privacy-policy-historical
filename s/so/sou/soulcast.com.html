<h3>SoulCast Privacy Policy Notice</h3>
  <p>At SoulCast, we respect the privacy of the users of our website and services
 and are committed to protecting it. We have created this policy to demonstrate
      our commitment to you and to help you understand it.</p>
  <p>Because protecting the privacy of the very young is important to us. Therefore,
      you must be at least 13 years of age to use this website. </p>
  <p>We do not collect personal information, including email addresses. We do not
      collect or maintain logs of our users' IP addresses and information regarding
      our users' use of our website and services.</p>
  <p>While SoulCast commits to protecting your privacy and doing everything we can
      to help you remain anonymous, third party associations may decrease your
      level of anonymity. For example, if you are associated with a third party
      ad service such as Google AdSense or other service, or if you voluntarily
      visit third party ad links on user pages or browse pages on which such
      ads exist, those third party services may track visits or collect IP addresses
      beyond the realms of SoulCast policies. SoulCast is not responsible for
      these third party logs nor does SoulCast endorse any action of this nature.
      To take extra steps to remain anonymous, you may wish to surf the website
      using a Proxy Server. <u>Learn more about surfing using proxies.</u></p>
  <p>In order to offer and provide optimized and personalized services, we use cookies.
      A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a user's browser from
      a web server and is eventually stored on a user's computer hard drive.
      Cookies are not associated with any individual user since each account
      is anonymous.</p>
  <p>Visit your Settings to edit your profile and other information. When you're signed
      in, SoulCast page headers will include a link to Settings. You can delete
      your SoulCast account from our website through your Settings. </p>
  <p>If you want to visit a site without leaving any trace of the visit, and not generate
      a record in the log file, you may wish to visit these options. </p>
  <p><strong>Anonymizer</strong></p>
  <p>You can surf anonymously with the help of a service called the Anonymizer x (<a href="http://www.anonymizer.com/3.0/index.shtml">http://www.anonymizer.com/3.0/index.shtml</a>). Check their site and just type a URL you want to visit -- the Anonymizer does
      the job for you, securing you from many potential dangers. When you follow
      a link on a page viewed via the Anonymizer you get there via the Anonymizer
      again, so you don't have to type a new URL. You can choose between pay
      or free service, but free service implies certain limitations such as 30
      seconds delay before pages are loaded, and only HTTP (pay service allows
      FTP and HTTPS). There are a few sites that are inaccessible via the Anonymizer,
      like some Web-based free email services. </p>
  <p>The Anonymizer is probably one of the most popular tools for anonymous surfing,
      but definitely not the only one. A good alternative is JANUS (<a href="http://www.rewebber.de/">http://www.rewebber.de/</a>) located in Germany. Janus is free, fast and can also encrypt the URL. Here
      is a quotation from their FAQ: </p>
<blockquote style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      "JANUS is able to encrypt URLs (uniform resource locator) in a way that these
      can be used as reference for a server. If a request with an encrypted URL
      occurs, JANUS is able to decrypt the URL and forward it to the server,
      without enabling the user to get knowledge about the server address. All
      references in the servers response are again encrypted before the response
      is forwarded to the client."
</blockquote>
  <p><strong>Proxy Servers</strong></p>
  <p>You can also anonymize one's web surfing by using a proxy server. Proxy servers
      are similar to the Anonymizer in that web pages are retrieved by the proxy
      server rather than by the person actually surfing. But there are several
      important distinctions: proxy servers don't help with cookies, hostile
      applets or code. In most of the cases their main purpose is to conceal
      your actual geographic location. Most proxy servers restrict access
      based on the IP address from which a user connects to them. </p>
  <p><strong>How to find your own proxy server</strong></p>
  <p>You can find a proxy server using just about any search engine and they will
      usually generate a list of Web pages where ISPs give complete instructions
      to their users of how they should configure their browsers. Try every proxy
      address and after 5 or 7 failures you will surely find a proxy server that
      works for you. </p>
  <p><strong>Is My Proxy Anonymous?</strong></p>
  <p>Not all proxy servers are truly anonymous. Some proxy servers may allow the system
      administrator of the site that you visit via a proxy server find out the
      IP address from which the proxy server is accessed, i.e. your real IP address.
      You can perform an anonymity check test at <a href="http://www.tamos.com/bin/proxy.cgi">http://www.tamos.com/bin/proxy.cgi</a>.</p>
  <p>If you get the message: "Proxy server is detected", then there is a security
      hole in your proxy, and information about your real IP address will be
      listed. If the message is Proxy server is not detected, it should be a
      secure proxy. </p>
  <p><strong>Final word on Proxies</strong></p>
  <p>Use proxies only when it's necessary. Surfing via proxy servers tends to slow
      down a site and is an additional load on the network and the servers. In
      addition, please use proxies for legal purposes only.</p>
  <p><strong>What if the government insists on obtaining info?</strong></p>
  <p>We do everything to ensure privacy. The only information that we will make available
      if required by law is what's already public on our website, such as the
      username and blog content.</p>
  <p>SoulCast reserves the right to modify all or some of this Privacy Policy at any
      time without notice. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post a notice
      on our website so our users are aware of what information we collect, how
      we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will
      use information only in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which
      the information was collected unless we have received explicit authorization
      from the appropriate user(s) to do otherwise.</p>
  <p><strong>Questions?</strong></p>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this website
      or your dealings with this SoulCast, you can send us a post using the tag:
      SoulCastPrivacy.</p>
