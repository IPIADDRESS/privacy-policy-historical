      <h1 class="h2 fw-500">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy will tell you what
information SouthBeach ("SouthBeach," "we," or "us") collects when you and
others visit and interact with our website at SouthBeach.com ("Site") and use
our mobile application ("Application," or "App") (the Site and App are collectively
referred to as the "Properties")how we use it and what choices you have about
how that information is used. We collect information from you and other users
in connection with the provision of our weight loss services and programs
(collectively, "Services").</p>



<p>We urge you to read our
entire Privacy Policy so that you will understand both our commitment to you
and your privacy, and how you can participate in that commitment.</p>



<p><strong>I. <u>Information You
Voluntarily Provide</u></strong></p>



<p><b>Personal/Contact Information</b></p>

<p>When
you interact with our Propertiesfor example, placing an order, or creating a
profile, we may request and collect certain information about you such as your
name, e-mail address, mailing address, contact numbers, age, height, weight, credit
card number, and expiration date, for the purpose of providing the Services to
you.  The personally identifiable information we collect when you place an
order, create a profile or register for membership on or through our Properties
may be used for the purposes outlined in this policy, including: (1) to fulfill
your requests for products and services; (2) to notify you of order, delivery,
and shipment statuses; (3) to provide you with offers from SouthBeach and its
affiliates; (4) enhance your experience with us; and (4) to contact you when
necessary.</p>

<p>We may
also request and collect your basic health profile information in order to use
certain Services on the Properties. For example, your health and age
information allows us to provide you with dietary options according to your
physical profile and dietary preferences. You will be notified at registration
if your profile excludes you from participation in the App and/or Site.
SouthBeach will not disclose your health and age information (including
self-reported height and weight) to third parties.</p>

<p><b>Credit Card and Payment Information</b></p>



<p>SouthBeach does not share any of your payment
information with third parties (except to its payment processors).</p>



<p><b>Information Provided in Optional
Surveys</b></p>



<p>SouthBeach periodically asks members to
participate in online surveys or fill out online questionnaires concerning
topics such as the effectiveness of the weight loss program, advertising
effectiveness and customer satisfaction.  All surveys and questionnaires are optional
and the information collected will not be associated with any user’s personal
information.  Information gathered for these purposes may be shared with third
parties in aggregated, non-personal form in order to improve customer
satisfaction and program effectiveness.  No personal information of any user
will be connected to survey or questionnaire results.</p>


<p><b>Other Information You May Voluntarily
Provide</b></p>



<p>From time to time, we may request and collect
email addresses or other contact information about friends and family of our
users and customers that they feel may benefit from the SouthBeach Services so
that SouthBeach may send information to such people.  For example, SouthBeach
collects email addresses when a customer provides us with that information so
that we may send out Referral Coupons. We also require the same when users
utilize certain functions such as "email this to a friend" features.</p>



<p><b>Linking
your account with third party applications and devices</b></p>

<p>For some of our Services, you will have
an option to connect your SouthBeach account with third party wearable tracking
application or device that measures or tracks your physical activity, such as
exercise, resting or sleep (a "Wearable Device"). If you connect your
SouthBeach account with an account registered to a Wearable Device, we may
share information with the host or operator of that Wearable Device concerning
your SouthBeach account. At the same time, data collected by your Wearable
Device will be shared with us and used in connection with your SouthBeach
account in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. You may, at any
time, cease this transfer of information. Additional information regarding what
information your Wearable Device collects and uses is available from the host
or operator of the Wearable Device.</p>

<p><strong>II. <u>Information Collected Automatically</u></strong></p>

<p>We
also collect non-personally identifiable information through our Internet log files,
which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and
other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Properties. This
information may be used for our own business purposes.   We may link this information
to personally identifiable information for these and other purposes, including
personalizing your experience on our Properties.  Information is also collected
when you use our App , including the software application needed to utilize the
App. During the installation of the Application and subsequent
synchronizations, we collect non-personally identifiable information concerning
your mobile device (such as the specific type of operating system and hardware
you have, and the amount of free and total memory) and the Application’s files
on your mobile device.</p>

<p>Our App also collects
information about your usage of the Application (such as the dates you last
synced with the Internet or the dates you last used certain features). When you
sync your device with the Site, we store some of this information.  Our App
will also perform frequent synching of information with your Wearable Device</p>

points to a site to retrieve the pixel image, information can be passed along
such as the IP address of the computer that requested the image, the time the
web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that was used, and
previously set cookie values.  Web beacons DO NOT pass or read personally
identifiable information about you.</p>


<p>Web beacons work in conjunction with
cookies set by trusted third parties that are used to assess the effectiveness
of particular promotional campaigns, to manage our advertising on other sites
or to optimize advertising once a user leaves a website.  View your browser’s
help section to determine how to configure your browser to reject or manage
first part (i.e., SouthBeach) and/or third-party cookies.  We share aggregated
information collected through web beacons to vendors for which the beacon was
set to determine the success of marketing campaigns, but do not disclose
personally identifying information to these vendors.</p>


<p>Third-party ad servers may track anonymous
website usage through web beacons on our Site and other websites. They do this
by setting a cookie (or reading a cookie previously placed by them) on users'
computers to track the activities of users who view a web page that contains
web beacons. Third party ad servers may use information about your visits to
this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
services that may be of interest to you. Periodically, upon our request, third
party ad servers may report the anonymous data that they collect on our behalf
back to us for our internal use and analysis and our treatment of this
anonymous data is governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy. To learn more
about targeted advertising, these providers, or how you may opt out, please

Technologies other than http cookies may be used by third parties in a similar
way, to recognize the email recipients’ computer or device and to keep track of
which user identities match to which devices or browsers, and those
technologies may not respond to browser settings that block conventional
cookies. You may opt out of many of these types of technologies by visiting the
NAI’s opt out page at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>



<p><b>How
we respond to "DO NOT TRACK" signals</b></p>

<p>We do not respond to web browser "do
not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide you the ability to exercise
choice regarding the collection of personal information about your online
activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.</p>



<p>We may use cookies and web beacons for
insight with respect to the usage of the Site, and so that we could continually
improve our customer’s experience.  At times, we use third parties to analyze
usage of our Properties . However, we do not disclose your personally
identifiable information to such third parties.</p>


<p><strong>III. <u>What SouthBeach Does
With Your Information</u></strong></p>



<p><b>How does SouthBeach protect customer
information?</b></p>

<p>Protecting your information from
unauthorized disclosure is important to us.  We use the industry standard
technology intended to protect the security of your information.  We have taken
certain physical, electronic, contractual and managerial steps designed to
safeguard the information we collect from you.  Unfortunately, no data
transaction over the Internet or stored on servers can be guaranteed to be 100%
secure.</p>



<p><b>Will SouthBeach disclose the
information it collects to outside parties?</b></p>



<p>We share your information (other than
payment information) with third-party vendors for shipping and billing purposes
and with other third-parties that provide a service for us to help us operate
our business and the Site and administer activities on our behalf.</p>



<p>We may also provide aggregate
statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site
information to reputable third-party vendors.</p>



<p>In addition, from time to time, we may
make customer e-mail addresses and postal addresses available to other third
party businesses whose products or services we believe might be of value to
you. If you do not want us to share your information with other companies or
organizations for their marketing purposes, please let us know by <a href="/jsps_hmr/unsubscribe/updateSubscription.jsp">unsubscribing
here</a>. If you opt-out of promotional or newsletter emails from SouthBeach, we
may continue to send you certain communications such as service announcements
and administrative messages, relating to SouthBeach that are necessary to our
relationship with you and your use of the Services.</p>



<p> In addition to what we have described
above, SouthBeach may also disclose your personal information to third parties
in certain limited circumstances, as follows (1) as necessary if we believe
that there has been a violation of our site Terms and Conditions, of the law,
of our rights or of any third party; (2) to respond to judicial process and
provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an
investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or
otherwise as required by law; and (3)  if you have given permission for us to
share your account information with other members of your household.</p>



<p>SouthBeach may also
sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your
personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information,
in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or
in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any
such transfer if the new entity's planned use or sharing of your information
differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>Mobile
Devices/Third-Party Fees</b></p>



<p>From time to time, we
may make mobile device applications and mobile marketing campaigns available to
you and may allow you to register for services that involve messages and/or
e-mails being sent to your mobile device. You are responsible for costs related
to such services, such as third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text
messaging, or airtime charges. You are solely responsible for those fees,
including any and all fees associated with the use of the applications,
delivery of the messages, e-mails or other materials to your mobile device.
Please consult your mobile service provider's pricing plan prior to purchasing
or downloading any application or registering for any such service to determine
the charges for sending and receiving text messages from/to your mobile device.
You will be given the opportunity to opt-in to receive text messages or emails
to your mobile device at the time you register for the campaign and with each
message or email you receive.</p>



<p>Mobile marketing
campaigns may involve your sending an e-mail from your mobile device to us or a
third-party campaign operator. An e-mail or other response will then be sent to
your mobile device. Opting to participate in a campaign is 100% your choice. 
When you engage in these mobile marketing campaigns, we and the third-party
campaign operator may collect your cell phone number, the name of your wireless
service provider, images that you send using your cell phone as part of the
campaign, and other relevant information.</p>



<p><b>Our Bulletin Boards, Social Media
Pages, Chat Rooms &amp; Blogs</b></p>

<p>As part of our Services, we may provide
support through bulletin boards, chat rooms (support groups), social media
pages, The Palm and blogs (collectively, "Forums").  Forums give our customers
the opportunity to interact with each other.  Forums are moderated to help keep
inappropriate messages from being posted.  You are offered the opportunity to
include your e-mail address with your message, but you are not obligated to do
so.  Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal
information through or on these Forums your information can be viewed, collected
and used by others.  In short, if you post personal information in a Forum that
is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other
parties in return.  We cannot control the actions of any third parties.  By
posting any comments, pictures or other information ("Content") in a Forum
hosted by us, you grant us a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual and
worldwide right to copy and post both such Content within our Site, and those
of our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, assigns, agents and licensees and any
social media outlets and advertising medium through which we are engaged or
elsewhere on our Site, without any further notice to you or any remuneration
therefore.</p>

<p><b>Notice to California Customers –
Your California Privacy Rights</b></p>

Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests
from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to
disclosing personal information to third parties for
the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may
have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to
third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer
has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. Accordingly, as
discussed above, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your information with
third party businesses for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, please
<a href="/jsps_hmr/unsubscribe/updateSubscription.jsp">unsubscribe

relationship with you.</p>
