   <span class="privacyheader">ONLINE PRIVACY STATEMENT</span> 
   <br><br><span class="privacycopy">Comedy Partners ("Comedy Partners", "We" or 
    "Us") has created this Privacy Statement to demonstrate our firm commitment 
    to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination 
    practices for the Comedy Partners web sites (the "Comedy Central Site").<br></span> 
   <br><span class="privacycopy">We gather certain information that you provide 
    to us, some passively and some actively, and we want to ensure that all users 
    of the Comedy Central Site are aware of exactly how and for what purpose that 
    information is being used. Comedy Partners believes that the information you 
    provide to us is essential to your enjoyment and successful use of the Comedy 
    Central Site. Our collection of information enables us to provide you with 
    a personalized web experience, and assists our sales team and advertisers 
    in efficiently reaching an appropriate audience. The information we request 
    is the minimum we believe necessary to achieve this goal.<br></span> 
   <br><span class="privacyheader">1. What data does Comedy Partners collect?<br>
    </span><span class="privacycopy">a. Certain data is automatically collected 
    from all visitors to the Comedy Central Site. This data includes your IP address, 
    your computer's operating system, and the type of browser you use to surf 
    the Internet. Your IP address tells us both your Internet Service Provider 
    (ISP) and the general geographic location you are connecting from. We may 
    also use your IP address to track the date and time you accessed the Comedy 
    Central Site, how long you stayed on the Comedy Central Site, and what pages 
    you visited. If you have configured your browser with your e-mail address, 
    this data may also be available to us.<br></span>
    <br>
    <span class="privacycopy">b. Comedy Partners makes use of cookies on its 
    sites. A cookie is a file transferred from a website to the hard drive of 
    your computer so that the website may track your activities on the website. 
    Cookies, by themselves, do not let a website know any personally identifying 
    information about you, such as your real name, address, etc., unless you previously 
    provided that information at the website or have set your preferences in your 
    browser to provide that information. Comedy Partners is not generally interested 
    in any one individual and does not collect personally identifiable information 
    about any one person using cookies. Cookie technology allows Comedy Partners 
    to keep track of your selections on the Comedy Central Site and to try to 
    make sure that you don't see the same ad repeatedly. Cookies are also used 
    to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so 
    that you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Comedy Central 
    Site.<br></span>
    <br>
    <span class="privacycopy">c. To access the Comedy Central Site, you do 
    not have to provide any personal information. Some features of the Comedy 
    Central Site do request personal information of you before granting access, 
    however.<br></span>
   <blockquote> <span class="privacycopysm">1. If you wish to participate in 
    the chat features offered on the Comedy Central Site, you will be asked to 
    create a nickname and password to be used when logging into the chat room 
    as well as for your e-mail address, gender, certification of age 18+, and zip code. Providing your real name is completely optional and omitting this information 
    in the registration form will still enable you to access the chat features. 
    You will also be asked whether you want to receive information about Comedy 
    Partners and site updates via e-mail. If you opt for this feature, you must 
    provide a valid e-mail address during the registration process.<br>
     2. The Comedy Central Site maintains public message boards. Posting to these 
     message boards requires you to register with Comedy Partners. When 
     posting to these message boards, you can do so under a pseudonym. If you do choose to post this information, please be aware 
     that Comedy Partners cannot control and assumes no responsibility for the 
     collection, use or misuse of this publicly accessible information by other 
     visitors to the Comedy Central Site.<br>
     3. The Comedy Central Site has a newsletter distributed via e-mail. If you 
     choose to subscribe to this feature, you must provide a valid e-mail address. 
     Your e-mail address will be used only by Comedy Partners for the distribution 
     of the newsletter and any promotions or marketing that we feel may be of 
     interest to you and will not be divulged to any third party, except as required 
     by court order. To no longer receive newsletters from us, please review how in our <a href="help.html#unsubnewsletters">help section on newsletters</a>.<br>
     4. Occasionally, Comedy Partners will request you to fill out a user survey. 
     Such surveys are optional to you, the users, but these surveys allow Comedy 
     Partners to better understand the demographics and interests of our users. 
     Your responses in combination with the responses of our other users help 
     Comedy Partners to improve the Comedy Central Site and attract sponsors and 
     advertisers. Should you choose to participate in such a survey, please note 
     Comedy Partners' policies regarding the sharing of user information with 
     third parties as stated in paragraph 3. If and when Comedy Partners does 
     choose to share its user information, it does so only in the aggregate such 
     that the third party will not be able to identify any individual user.<br>
     5. Comedy Partners may, occasionally run contests, sweepstakes, or other 
     promotions sponsored by Comedy Partners or our partners and sponsors. If 
     you are identified as a winner, Comedy Partners may request your name and 
     mailing address. This information is used only to deliver your prize(s) and 
     will not be used for any commercial or unrelated purpose.<br>
     6. If you contact Comedy Partners through the regular mail or via e-mail, 
     Comedy Partners may keep a record of that correspondence. Any personally 
     identifiable information on your communication will not be used for a commercial 
     or unlawful purpose.<br>
     7. Comedy Partners does not control the acts of its users. All users should 
     be aware that, when they disclose personal information such as their actual 
     name, e-mail address, etc., the information may be collected and used by 
     others to send that person unsolicited e-mail from other parties outside 
     Comedy Partners.</span>
   </blockquote>
   <span class="privacycopy">d. The privacy of minors. Comedy 
    Partners believes that it is particularly important to protect the privacy 
    of minors online. Comedy Partners defines a "minor" as any person under 13 
    years of age. Comedy Partners does not share personal information about minor 
    users with third parties, and Comedy Partners does not sell or rent personal 
    information about any of our users, regardless of age. </span> <br><br>
	<span class="privacycopy">e. When you order products from us, we also collect personally identifiable information from you. If you order one of our products or services, we will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, product selections, credit card or other payment information, order number, referring URL, IP address and a password. We collect this, and other information, as disclosed in this policy, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order and to send you promotional materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contains. These changes will be automatically kept for future use. We use good faith efforts not to provide third parties with access to your individual account information, unless stated otherwise on the Site. We reserves the right to provide non-identifiable consumer data to third parties including, but not limited to, general statistics about pages viewed on our site, sales and other shopping information. </span> <br><br>
<span class="privacyheader">2. How does Comedy Partners use your information?<br></span>
    <br>
    <span class="privacycopy">Comedy Partners puts the non-personally identifiable 
    information passively gathered whenever you visit our sites and the personal 
    information that you voluntarily provide to several uses.<br>
    </span><span class="privacycopy">a. Your IP address is used to assist us 
    in diagnosing problems with our server, to administer the Comedy Central Site 
    and to provide information to our sponsors and advertisers.<br>
    b. Comedy Partners may use the information you provide to perform statistical 
    analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our users and to 
    analyze how and where to invest our resources.<br>
    c. Comedy Partners may use personal contact information voluntarily provided 
    by you for promotional and/or marketing purposes.<br>
    d. Demographic and profile data is used to tailor our users' experience at 
    the Comedy Central Site, directing users to content we think may be of interest 
    to that user, and displaying content for which the user may have shown a preference.<br>
    e. Both our internal sales team and outside advertising firms may utilize 
    the information you provide us to better tailor your experience on the Comedy 
    Central Site. Without the data collected, Comedy Partners would not know what 
    the most popular regions of the Comedy Central Site are, Comedy Partners would 
    not be able to provide an effective forum for our sponsors to advertise in, 
    nor would Comedy Partners be able to measure which promotions are successful.<br></span>
   <br><span class="privacyheader">3. What information does Comedy Partners 
    share with third parties?</span> <br>
    <span class="privacycopy">a. User information, including but not limited 
    to demographic information, may be shared on an aggregate basis with affiliates, 
    partners, advertisers or other third parties as may be necessary.<br>
    <br>
    b. At no time will Comedy Partners impart to third parties individual users' 
    e-mail addresses or other individual personal information unless required 
    to do so by law or to protect the rights of Comedy Partners.<br>
    <br>
    c. Companies that place advertising on our sites may have the ability to assign 
    you a separate cookie while you are accessing the Comedy Central Site. 
    We do not control these cookies, nor do we have access to this information. 
    We contract with DoubleClick to sell and manage the advertisements that you 
    see on the Comedy Central Site. DoubleClick makes available both its policies 
    and information practices at www.doubleclick.net. DoubleClick may use information 
    (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about 
    your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements 
    about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information 
    about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information 
    used by these companies, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank" class="privacylink">click 
    here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    d. Comedy Partners encourages all third parties to adhere to our policies 
    regarding the privacy of our users, but Comedy Partners does not assume any 
    responsibility for any actions of third parties.<br>
    <br>
    e. Comedy Partners responds to subpoenas, warrants or other court orders regarding 
    information that is contained within our access logs concerning any user. 
    Comedy Partners also reserves the right to release the information concerning 
    a user who we believe is in violation of our content guidelines, even without 
    a subpoena, warrant, or other court order. Comedy Partners cooperates with 
    law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our servers for illegal 
    activities. We also reserve the right to report any illegal activity to law 
    enforcement for prosecution.<br></span><br>
   <span class="privacyheader">4. Financial information.</span><br>
    <span class="privacycopy">Financial information may be requested of you 
    either as part of an online survey the results of which are to be used for 
    demographic analysis purposes or in conjunction with the purchase of goods 
    and services from the Comedy Central Site. Financial information will not 
    be shared with anyone outside of Comedy Partners other than general information 
    on an aggregate basis.<br></span>
   <br><span class="privacyheader">5. How do I opt-out, remove, change, or 
    modify my information?</span> <br>
    <span class="privacycopy">You have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving 
    communications from us at any time. To change or modify any information 
    you have provided to us from our database please do so through the member profile. To no longer receive newsletters from us, please review how in our <a href="help.html#unsubnewsletters">help section on newsletters</a>.

    <br><span class="privacyheader">6. Kids policy.</span> <br>
    <span class="privacycopy">The safety of children is very important to Comedy 
    Partners, and Comedy Partners recommends that parents review our Privacy Policy 
    before allowing their children to access the Comedy Central Sites, especially 
    the chat and message board areas. Children should always ask a parent for 
    permission before sending personal information to anyone online. They should 
    also be instructed not to fill out any forms or register at any domain without 
    a parent's knowledge and consent. Comedy Partners does not share personal 
    information about users under the age of 13 with third parties.<br></span>
    <br> <span class="privacyheader">7. How does Comedy Partners protect the 
    user data it collects online?</span> <br>
    <span class="privacycopy">Comedy Partners employs a number of physical, 
    electronic and managerial safeguards to protect collected user data.<br></span>
    <br> <span class="privacyheader">8. Disclaimers.</span> <br>
    <span class="privacycopy">a. 
    All users should be aware while using any service where you disclose personal 
    information online voluntarily, including in chat areas, on message or bulletin 
    boards, or through e-mail, that such information can be collected and used 
    by others. If you use these services on the Comedy Central Site and voluntarily 
    provide any information on our bulletin boards or in chat areas, you do so 
    at your own risk. Comedy Partners cannot make any representations regarding 
    the security of such transfer of information.<br>
    <br>

    sites. Comedy Partners is not responsible for the privacy practices or the 
    content of such web sites.<br>
