Except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Site in order for the Site to provide Customized Advertising or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Site, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Site.

<li><strong><u>More Information About Cookie Controls.&nbsp;<br></u></strong>For the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/delete-manage-cookies#ie=ie-11"><strong>Internet Explorer 11&nbsp;</strong></a><a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95647"><strong>Chrome&nbsp;</strong></a><a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/use-of-cookies"><strong>Safari&nbsp;</strong></a><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer"><strong>Firefox</strong></a></p>
<p>If your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be able to access controls to:<br></p>
<p>✓<u>Delete existing browser cookies</u><br> through the “Internet Options”, “Settings”, Preferences”, “Options” or similar menu selection in your browser’s menu or otherwise as directed by your browser’s support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.<br></p>
<p>✓&nbsp;<u>Disable browser cookies&nbsp;</u>through the same browser controls which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted. Additional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser’s support feature. (See the “help” section of your browser for more information.) Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices. If you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.</p>
<p>✓Choose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set. (You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.) This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Site. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser’s support feature.</p>
<p>✓Seek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser’s support features.The above options may cover browser cookies set by the Site, browser cookies not set by the Site (sometimes called third party cookies) and/or both types of browser cookies.<br></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS. ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM DO NOT TRACK OPTIONS THAT MAY ALSO BE OFFERED BY CERTAIN BROWSERS.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Many tools discussed above are “Internet browser cookie based.”&nbsp;</u></strong>This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices. For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described in our Ad Choices link, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.</li>
<li><strong><u>The tools are “Internet browser and Device-specific” or “Device- specific”&nbsp;</u></strong>Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices. This means, for example, that if you block or disable browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9. Further, you may need to separately exercise your options for other platforms, such as mobile platform (as described below). See&nbsp;<a href="http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.html">our Ad Choices link here&nbsp;</a>for more information about this Site and other options you may have regarding Customized Advertising across Devices.</li>
<li><strong><u>Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs.&nbsp;</u></strong>Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and,&nbsp;<strong>if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.&nbsp;</strong>For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.</li>
<li><strong><u>You shall still receive advertisements.&nbsp;</u></strong>Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers’, Advertisers’ or the Site’s Tracking Technologies does not mean that you shall no longer receive online ads. If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Site to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes as described in the “Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies” section.</li>
<li><strong><u>Limitations Regarding Web Beacons&nbsp;</u></strong>. Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities.</li>
<li><strong><u>How to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies).&nbsp;</u></strong>CONTROL OF FLASH LSOS (SOMETIMES KNOWN AS FLASH COOKIES) MUST BE HANDLED SEPARATELY. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER. Deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options shall not remove Flash LSOs. For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, please visit<a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee 8.html&nbsp;</a>. If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services may not function properly.</li>
<li><strong><u>Other Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies.&nbsp;</u></strong>In addition to the above, if you delete or disable Tracking Technologies set by the Site, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain features or functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, saving your player settings or other purposes described in “&nbsp;<a href="https://html-cleaner.com/#4.2">Other Information Collected By Us&nbsp;</a>”above, and some of our other services may not function properly. In addition to the above, if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), the Site may no longer be able to offer certain functionality to you, such as enabling SMN login or saving your player settings and certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.</li>
<li><strong><u>Mobile Platforms.&nbsp;</u></strong>Certain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be browser cookie based. We encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide to you regarding these Identifiers.</li>
<li><strong><u>Certain Identifiers.&nbsp;</u></strong>Certain Identifiers we set may not be deleted, blocked or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such Identifiers rely on, or are associated with, browser cookies or other Tracking Technologies.</li>
<li><strong><u>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.&nbsp;</u></strong>Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.</li>
</ul>
<p>We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for Customized Advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in this Section 5.2.3 and in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.</p>

<p><strong>7.1 Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information.</strong><br> We may disclose your Personal Information within the VII family or to third parties under the circumstances described below.&nbsp;<strong>7.1.1 Disclosure to VII.&nbsp;</strong>We may disclose Personal Information to VII for marketing, administrative and/or other purposes. You can choose to opt-out of certain such uses as described in the “&nbsp;<a href="https://html-cleaner.com/#5.1">Opting-Out of Certain Uses of Personal Information” Section above.&nbsp;</a><strong>7.1.2 Disclosure of Certain Information in Postings Intended to Be Disclosed.&nbsp;</strong>Certain Personal Information associated with a Posting may be intended for disclosure (&nbsp;<u>“Posting Information”&nbsp;</u>), such as username. We shall disclose Posting Information in connection with the display of, and other services relating to, such Posting.&nbsp;<strong>7.1.3 Disclosure In Connection with Co-Branded Services and Features.</strong>The Site may also offer services and features, such as events and Promotions, that we put together with another company (&nbsp;<u>“Co-Branded Partner”&nbsp;</u>) and that may be hosted on the Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner’s or a Promotion-specific website, application or other interactive service. The Co-Branded Partner shall be identified on the co- branded feature or service and you shall be given the opportunity to opt into any disclosure by VII to the Co-Branded Partner for marketing purposes of Personal Information VII collects as part of the co-branded service or feature and be provided with a link to the Co-Branded Partner’s privacy policy. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of such Personal Information for marketing purposes, you shall need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly and the use of such information by Co-Branded Partner is subject to Co-Branded Partner’s privacy policy. Please note that your Information may be shared with Co-Branded Partners for purposes of administering or conducting the co-branded services and features (but not for marketing purposes) without a separate opt in (for example, if the Co-Branded Partner is administering a Promotion you have entered, your Information may be shared with the Co-Branded Partner so that the Co-Branded Partner can verify your eligibility and/or contact you if you are a potential winner).&nbsp;<strong>7.1.4 Disclosure to Operational Service Providers.&nbsp;</strong>We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site’s services, features, functions and operations. We shall refer to these third parties as&nbsp;<u>“operational service providers”&nbsp;</u>. We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we disclose your Personal Information to operational service providers for the purpose of providing services to us.&nbsp;<strong>7.1.5 Disclosure to Certain Other Third Parties.&nbsp;</strong>In addition to the above, we make your Personal Information available to certain third parties in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process) or if requested by a governmental agency or other authority as part of an investigation;</li>
<li>If we believe your actions violate any law, rule, regulation and/or the&nbsp;<a href="http://southpark.cc.com/about/legal/terms-of-use">Terms of Use Agreement&nbsp;</a>, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy or Additional Terms;</li>
<li>In connection with Promotions, as necessary to administer the Promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (for example, to provide winners’ lists or make required filings as appropriate);</li>
<li>If you agree to have your Personal Information shared with or otherwise disclosed to a third party for marketing or other purposes, in which case the third party’s use of your Personal Information is subject to the third party’s own privacy policy;</li>
<li>If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate: to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries; to protect our business and assets or the rights, property or safety of the Channel, VII, or any of its or their operational service providers, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party; to limit our legal liability; to defend our interests; to enforce this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use Agreement and/or to comply with our legal, regulatory, audit and compliance obligations or requests by law enforcement or other governmental authorities and/or</li>

<p><strong>8.5 Children or Ineligible Teenagers.&nbsp;</strong>If we, or VII, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of the Site or certain features of this Site (&nbsp;<u>“Ineligible Teenagers”&nbsp;</u>), the child or Ineligible Teenager, or parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager (the&nbsp;<u>“Parent”&nbsp;</u>), may unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a Parent of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state). In addition, Parents who wish to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership must either (i) use their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the “Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use” Section of the&nbsp;<a href="http://southpark.cc.com/about/legal/terms-of-use">Terms of Use Agreement&nbsp;</a>to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership or (ii) send an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@viacom.com?Subject=SouthPark:%20Deactivationof%20Ineligible%20Accounts">privacy@viacom.com&nbsp;</a>(or, if available, contact us by using the Site’s ContactUs tool) and provide us with your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, the URL of the Site and request to terminate your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration or (iii), if a Parent does not have his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, send an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@viacom.com?Subject=SouthPark:%20Deactivationof%20Ineligible%20Accounts">privacy@viacom.com&nbsp;</a>(or, if available, contact us by using the Site’s ContactUs tool) that includes the Parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s name and/or email address as registered on the Site, and the URL of the Site. If a Parent sends an email under subsections (ii) or (iii), the Site may send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration and may provide or request additional information (for example, requesting that the Parent provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager) before terminating the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and, upon or prior to termination, may notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>

<li><strong>PROTECTION OF INFORMATION.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While the Internet and data transmission over the Internet is not 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information. However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions, private communications or Information. While the Internet and data transmission over the Internet is not 100% secure from intrusion, we conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions. We also limit our employees’ access to Information collected by the Site to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such Information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality shall be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong><u>Phishing&nbsp;</u></strong>. Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity data and financial account credentials. “Phishers” use ‘spoofed’ emails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites, or otherwise respond in a manner that is, designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers.&nbsp;<strong>WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!&nbsp;</strong>If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@viacom.com?Subject=South%20Park%20-Phishing">privacy@viacom.com&nbsp;</a>, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.</p>
