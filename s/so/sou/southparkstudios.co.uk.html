When we plan to disclose your Personal Information to Advertisers, we ask for you to opt in to do so, in which case their use of your information is subject to the Advertisers' own privacy policies. <p></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><b><p></p>Operational Service Providers <p></p></b> We have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site's services, features, functions and operations. We will refer to these third parties as "<u>operational service providers</u>". We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with this Site or the Comedy Central Channel. Additionally, such providers are not permitted to use your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes. </li><p></p>
<li><b></b><p><b>Other Non-Affiliated Third Parties.</b></p> We will make your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties in the following limited circumstances: 
 
<ul>
<li>When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); </li>
<li>If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, the Terms of Use Agreement, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, or any of our other terms and conditions, Rules, offerings or any other services, features or functions of the Site, or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of the Site, the Comedy Central Channel, the Parent Companies, the Affiliates, or any of its or their operational service providers, suppliers, Advertisers, customers or registered users, or any other party;  </li>
<li>If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations; or </li>
<li>In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates </li><p></p>
</ul>
</li></ol>
</li>
         <li><b>Security &amp; Protection of Personal Information</b><p></p>  We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the site. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy. </li><p></p>
         <li><b>Phishing</b><p></p>  Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. "Phishers" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Sensitive Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator at privacy-admin@comedycentral.com, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer</li><p></p>
        <li><b>Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information</b><p></p>  Generally, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by this Site. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. Deletion or attempted deletion of certain Personal Information, such as your user name, may not be permitted and/or may result in suspension of your account or termination of any registration you may have made. To review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by the Site,  click to http://www.southparkstudios.co.uk/about/contact-us/ and sending a request or click your user name to get to the account update page. <p></p> 
  
      <p>Children under the age of 18 that are unknowingly registered on the Site are in violation of the Terms of use Agreement. Parents (including legal guardians) of children that registered on the Site in violation of the Terms of Use Agreement who wish to terminate their child's membership must send their child's user name in an email to the Site's Privacy Administrator and request to terminate your child's account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person without the user's User ID. (Please see above for how to change your preferences or the information associated with your account.) If a parent does not have his or her child's User ID, the parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's date of birth. The parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent of the ineligible child. Comedy Central will send a confirming email to the parent via the email address provided to verify that the parent wishes to terminate his or her child's account and registration. The parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. Comedy Central will then terminate the child's account but will notify the child of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>
  
    
      <p>We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation a registered user of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user's account or any services, features or functions. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.</p></li>
    <li><b>Questions</b> <p></p> If you have questions about our Privacy Policy or if you do not understand any information about how we collect, maintain, use or share your personally identifiable information, you may contact us directly by sending an email to privacy-admin@comedycentral.com. </li><p></p>
    <li><b>Sole Statement</b><p></p> This document is the sole statement of the Site's Privacy Policy with respect to this Site, and no summary, restatement or other version thereof, or other privacy statement or policy, in any form, including, without limitation, machine-generated, is valid. </li>
