(Please see above for how to change your preferences or the information associated with your account.) If a parent does not have his or her child's User ID, the parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's date of birth. The parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent of the ineligible child. Comedy Central will send a confirming email to the parent via the email address provided to verify that the parent wishes to terminate his or her child's account and registration. The parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. Comedy Central will then terminate the child's account but will notify the child of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>
  
    

      <p>We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation a registered user of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user's account or any services, features or functions. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.</p></li>

    <li><b>Questions</b> <p></p> If you have questions about our Privacy Policy or if you do not understand any information about how we collect, maintain, use or share your personally identifiable information, you may contact us directly by sending an email to privacy-admin@comedycentral.com. </li><p></p>
