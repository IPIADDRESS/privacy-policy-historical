<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome!&nbsp; You have arrived at a website that is provided by Participant Media, LLC (“<strong>Company</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”).&nbsp; This “<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>” governs your use of <a href="http://www.participantmedia.com">www.participantmedia.com</a>, <a href="http://www.participant.com">www.participant.com</a>, <a href="http://www.soulpancake.com">www.soulpancake.com</a>, and also applies to your use of all features, applications, content, downloads, websites and other online services that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, referred to herein as the “<strong>Services</strong>”), regardless of how you access or use the Services, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of our Services (unless otherwise stated below).</p>
<p>The privacy of each and every user matters to us, and we strive for transparency in all of our data privacy practices, especially when it comes to identifying the information we collect, use, share, and disclose, as well as the ways we help keep your information safe.&nbsp; Unless we have obtained your permission or otherwise disclosed it in this Privacy Policy, Company does not sell your personal information for our own financial gain, nor will we share your personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes without first offering you an opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of such sharing.&nbsp; We take our responsibility to protect your information very seriously.&nbsp; Please remember, we are always here to answer any questions you have, and we look forward to serving you for years to come.&nbsp; <strong>To the extent we provide you notice on our Services of different or additional privacy policies or practices (<em>e.g.</em>, at the point of our collection), those additional terms shall govern such data collection and use.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, please review the Service’s <a href="http://www.participantmedia.com/terms-use"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></a>, which governs your use of the Services.&nbsp; <em>By using our Services</em>,<em> you consent to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service and our collection, use and sharing of your information and data, and other activities, as described below.</em></p>
<p><u><strong>Collection of Information</strong></u></p>
<p>Company collects information from users in two ways.</p>
<p>First, we may collect names, email addresses, home addresses, telephone numbers, and any other information that may be used to identify you personally as an individual.&nbsp; This type of data is often referred to as PII (personally identifiable information), and is most commonly collected when you submit information to us through a form on the Services.&nbsp; We only collect PII from you when you use certain Services.&nbsp; For example, if you sign up for a newsletter, participate in our brand ambassador program, or submit a customer service form, we may collect your name, address, telephone number, email, or other PII.</p>
<p>The other type of information we collect is more generic in nature and tells us about your online habits and preferences, like when you browse our Services.&nbsp; These collection processes can also be used to help us offer a more entertaining and engaging experience.&nbsp; This type of information doesn’t tell us who you are exactly, but it can tell us things like the pages you’ve viewed, how long you spend on our Services, what links you’ve clicked on, the time in which you view content, and where you are located.&nbsp; This type of information is sometimes referred to as non-PII (non-personally identifiable information).&nbsp; The type of non-PII we may collect from you includes information about what you look at on our Services, when you visit our Services, what advertisements you respond to, the types of devices you use (computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.), your IP address, links you follow from other websites, and content you engage with.&nbsp; This type of information is sometimes combined to form aggregate data, which helps us summarize and analyze our customers’ experiences.&nbsp; We also allow this type of information to be collected by ad networks.&nbsp; An ad network is a company that connects advertisers to websites for the purpose of hosting advertisements.&nbsp; We also employ the use of analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, that may gather this same type of information.&nbsp; Aggregate data like this will not identify you individually and cannot be used to pinpoint any one specific person.</p>
<p><u><strong>Use of Information</strong></u></p>
<p>We may use your information for various purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>to provide you with information such as to send you electronic newsletters or to provide you with special offers or promotional and marketing materials on behalf of us or third parties, including to let you know about upcoming events;</li>
<li>to enable you to participate in a variety of the Services’ features such as to enable you to participate in online surveys, loyalty programs, entry sweepstakes, contests or other promotions;</li>
<li>to improve the Services, marketing endeavors or our Services offerings;</li>
<li>to customize your experience on the Services or to serve you specific content that we believe is relevant to you;</li>
<li>to provide customer support;</li>
<li>to contact you with regard to your use of the Services and, in our discretion, changes to the Services and/or Services’ policies;</li>
<li>to improve the overall experience at the Services;</li>
