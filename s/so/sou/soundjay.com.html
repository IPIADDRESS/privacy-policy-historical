              privacy of our visitors to SoundJay.com is important to us. At SoundJay.com, 
              we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. 
              Here is information on what types of personal information we receive 
              and collect when you use visit SoundJay.com, and how we safeguard your 
              information. We never sell your personal information to third parties.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Log Files</strong><br>
              As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained 
              in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet 
              protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as 
              AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such 
              as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site 
              and which pages you visited throughout our site. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong><br>
              We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences 
              when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup 
              once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, 
              such as forums.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Third Party Advertising</strong><br>
              We also use third party advertisements on SoundJay.com to support 
              our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies 
              and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also 
              send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense 
              program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser 
              you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have 
              Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes 
              (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) 
              or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as 
              showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).<br>
              <br>
            <strong>DoubleClick DART Cookies</strong><br>
                We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google's DoubleClick, 
                which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and 
                visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense 
                advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your
                interests ("interest based targeting"). The ads served will be targeted 
                based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been 
                viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel 
                advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about 
                hockey). DART uses "non personally identifiable information". It does NOT 
                track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, 
                physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account 
                numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all 
                sites using this advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a>              <br>
                <br>
              	You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party 
                cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such 
                as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to 
                interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the 
                inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or 
                accounts.
                <br><br>
                Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising 
                program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit 
                a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
