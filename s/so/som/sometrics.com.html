The foregoing is anonymous information that does not contain any Personal Information about you.  We use this information to improve our website and Services.</p>
        <p>Sometrics, Inc. (or our service providers) may place a temporary or persistent "cookie" on your computer's hard drive for purposes of (1) allowing our customers the convenience of not having to remember their login information when accessing our website, (2) gathering and aggregating statistical data about the usage of our website and Services for customers, and (3) sending targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you.  Cookies are simple, harmless text files that remember the internet browser you use to access the internet.  These cookies do not track, retain, or store any Personal Information, and they are used to gather the same general internet information that is available to all internet service providers, search engines, and websites.  Examples of this information include, without limitation, a visitor's general location based on IP address, information from the visitor's browser such as browser type, type of operating system, keywords used while searching, websites visited, monitor resolution settings.

However, by adjusting your browser settings, you can choose to automatically block cookies from specific web sites, from all web sites, from web sites without a privacy policy, or from all third parties. Consult the help manual for your browser for detailed information.  Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict Cookies, but later you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to restrict Cookies on that device as well.  Deleting a Cookie does not mean you will no longer see online advertising; it does mean that Sometrics will not be able to target an advertisement to you based on information derived from the Cookie.</p>
