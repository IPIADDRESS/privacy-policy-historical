          <strong>Browser Log Files:</strong> Our servers automatically log each visitor to the Web Properties and collect and record certain Browsing Information about each visitor.  The Browsing Information reveals nothing personal about the user and includes only the generic information described in the definition of “Browsing Information.”  We may use this information to examine our traffic in the aggregate, but we do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals.

          <strong>Cookies:</strong> From time to time, we and/or our advertisers or other third parties may send a “cookie” to your computer.  A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive and that can be re-sent to the serving website on subsequent visits.  A cookie, by itself, cannot read other data from your hard disk or read other cookie files already on your computer.  A cookie, by itself, does not damage your system.  We, our advertisers and other third parties may use cookies to identify and keep track of, among other things, those areas of the Web Properties and third party websites that you have visited in the past in order to enhance your next visit to the Web Properties.  Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times that you have seen an advertisement and obtain similar analytical information.  You can choose whether or not to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser, but some functionality of the Web Properties may be impaired or not function as intended if you choose not to accept cookies.  See the “Third Party Opt Out” section below.

          <strong>Web Beacons:</strong> Some of our web pages and electronic communications may contain images, which may or may not be visible to you, known as Web Beacons (sometimes referred to as ‘clear gifs’). Web Beacons collect only limited information that includes a cookie number; time and date of a page view; and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides.  We may also carry Web Beacons placed by third party advertisers.  These Web Beacons do not carry any Personal Information and are only used to track usage of the Web Properties and activities associated with the Web Properties. See the “Third Party Opt Out” section below.

          <strong>Unique Identifier:</strong> We may assign you a unique internal identifier to help keep track of your future visits. We use this information to gather aggregate demographic information about our visitors, and we use it to personalize the information you see on the Web Properties and some of the electronic communications you receive from us.  We keep this information for our internal use, and this information is not shared with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Third Party Opt Out:</strong> Although we do not presently do so, in the future we may allow third-party companies to serve advertisements and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit the Web Properties.  These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (including, but not limited to, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the Web Properties in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.  These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information, as further described above.  Through these technologies, the third party may have access to and use such non-personalized information about your online usage activity.
