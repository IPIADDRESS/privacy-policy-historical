We also want our users to be aware that we collect data about their use of our site. This data is used to help us understand what our customers do on our site so that we may refine our site appropriately. Depending upon what you do on our site we collect different kinds of information about you in order to make sure that the site works efficiently, completes transactions that you request, and is customized to your needs.<br><br>
We request specific information from you in order to facilitate a transaction that you initiate (for example, bidding in our Auctions Online section). Your financial information is handled by reputable third-party banking institutions and credit card authorization and payment facilitation companies.  They receive only the information required to verify and authorize your credit card and to process payments. They are under strict obligation to keep your credit card information and transaction records private and secure.<br><br>
By answering "yes" to our data privacy release question on our registration page, you agree that we may share your "personally identifiable information" (as defined in the next sentence) with our affiliated companies (other members of the Sotheby's group of companies) and partners located throughout the world. Your "personally identifiable information" consists of your name, email address, billing address (including zip or postal code) and your telephone number. Members of the Sotheby's group of companies may be able to provide you with notice of special events and opportunities in your collecting areas of interest. As noted below, if you visit our site from a link provided on Amazon.com or an email or other communication sent to you by Amazon.com, we may share with Amazon.com your personally identifiable information (that you provide to us and only if you have consented to our data privacy release) and aggregate transaction information. In addition, we may share aggregated statistics, not linked to any individual, about browsing, bidding and buying patterns with our marketing partners. These statistics are not and cannot be linked by our marketing partners to you as an individual. We will not share any of your personally identifiable information with any other third party - other than to carry out a transaction that you initiate - unless you provide your consent in advance.<br><br>
If you wish to correct or update any personally identifiable information in your account, you may do so at any time by following the directions in the "Edit Profile" section of "Your Auctions".

We collect the information necessary to effect your purchase. That information is delivered directly to the Sotheby's order department.

We will send you periodic notices about upcoming sales and events related to collecting category preferences that you indicated, as well as other products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.  In order to provide the most relevant and personalized information about items up for auction, the content of the email updates you receive may be based upon your past bidding activity. If you decide you do not want to receive these notices anymore, you can unsubscribe at any time.

<u>When you register to bid on Auctions Online.</u><br><br>
In order to bid in our Auctions Online service, you must complete the required fields of our registration/log-in page. Your bidder name will never be disclosed to any third party other than the seller of an item that you purchase, and, if you have permitted it, to the sellers of items on which you bid but are not the winning bidder. If having given permission you do not want a particular authorized SOTHEBYS.COM seller to contact you about items that may be of interest to you, please contact that seller directly. Each seller is obligated to honor your requests regarding marketing.<br><br>

During the registration process you may indicate particular collecting areas of interest and provide us with some demographic information about yourself. This information is not required. We use this information to create special offers and programs for you. We may notify you of these offers and programs by email. If you wish to edit the preferences you have selected, you may do so by going to the "Edit Profile" section of "Your Auctions" and following the instructions. If you do not wish to be contacted by SOTHEBYS.COM about special items or events, and other products and services that we believe may be of interest to you, or if you have any concerns about an authorized seller's use of your personal information, please email us at <a href="mailto:onlineprivacy@sothebys.com" class="gbllink">onlineprivacy@SOTHEBYS.COM</a>.<br><br>

In order to verify and authenticate your use of your credit card, we have engaged a third party to perform a number of security confirmations during the browsing, bidding and buying process. Our payment and fraud prevention partners will confirm information that you provide to us in order to protect our sellers and you - by confirming that your credit card information has not been misappropriated. If you are the winning bidder on an item, our partners will confirm that your credit card company will accept the charge and effect the payment.<br><br>

While we do personalize your screen to greet you and let you know that you are logged-in, neither your name nor your username are displayed to any other bidder. For each separate item on which you bid, you will be assigned a new paddle number. When you review your account, including open and closed auctions, your bids will be highlighted for you. This information is not visible to other bidders unless you share your computer with others. If you do share a computer, we recommend that you close your browser after visiting the site in order to protect the confidentiality of your bidding history. Please note that because you must re-enter your username and password in order to bid, unless you share your username and password, no one other than you should be able to place bids in your name. If your computer system does not accept cookies, our system will generate a unique URL (uniform resource locator) that will permit the bidding and personalization applications necessary to use the Auctions Online service to function solely for the duration of your visit.<br><br>

SOTHEBYS.COM will never use your credit card information or any other financial information that you may provide for any purpose other than to authenticate, verify and complete your purchases. We will not share, sell or license this information with or to any third party except to complete a purchase.</td>
