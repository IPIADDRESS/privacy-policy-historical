					<p class="font14Bold">What You Should Know</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						We at Sotheby's International Realty Affiliates, Inc. and the family of companies at Cendant Corporation, our owner, 
						(referred to as "we," "us," or "our") recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of certain information ("Information") 
						collected about our customers and prospective customers (referred to as "Customers," "you" or "your").  This privacy statement 
						discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.  It is our intention to give you an 
						understanding about how we collect your Information and the use we make of it in the course of our business.
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						To that end, we gather two types of information about Customers: data that Customers provide through optional, voluntary 
						registration on our sites; and data we gather through aggregated tracking, mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites.  
						Such information enables us to tailor our content to fit Customers' needs better. Providing such aggregated data is essential 
						to keeping our service free to Customers.  However, be assured that we will not disclose personal Information to third parties 
						without your consent, except as may be noted in this Privacy Policy or disclosed to you when the Information is submitted.
					</p>
					<p class="font12Bold">
						How do we collect Information?
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						<i>Optional registration</i>
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						We collect information by specifically requesting it from you. Generally this occurs when you register at a site or request 
						information or a service. Usually, our sites and service partners use your information to operate the sites and to deliver 
						services. Our sites also use your information to inform you about other products or services available from us.
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						<i>Usage tracking</i>
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						<u>Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses:</u>
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet so 
						that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" Web pages.  We collect 
						IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to audit the use of our site. When Customers request pages from 
						our sites, our servers log the Customers' IP addresses.  We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally 
						identifiable, which means that a Customer's session will be logged, but the Customer will remain anonymous to us.  We can 
						and will use IP addresses to identify a Customer when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our site terms of 
						use or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						<u>Use Of Cookies</u>
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						What are cookies?  Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site sends to yours computer for record-keeping purposes, 
						which information is stored in a file on your computer. Cookies make Web surfing easier for you by saving your preferences so 
						that we can use the saved information to facilitate your use of our Web site when you return to the site.  Cookies do not tell 
						us your individual identity unless you have chosen to provide it to us.  We never save passwords or credit card information in 
						cookies.  The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, you'll find that most major Web sites use them.
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						By showing how and when Customers use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not.  Many improvements 
						and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed.  This information is most easily 
						tracked with cookies.  We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our Customers' needs.  Most 
						cookies expire after a defined period of time, or you can delete your cookie file at any time.  Most browsers are initially set 
						up to accept cookies.  You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, note 
						that some parts of our services will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies.  For example, 
						without cookies, you will have to log into the web site every time you use your personalized settings.
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						We have two primary uses for cookies.  First, we use them to specify a Customer's preferences.  For example, Customers can save 
						their log in information so that they do not have to log into the website every visit.  Second, we use cookies to track Customers' 
						Web site usage trends and patterns.  This helps us understand our Customers' needs better and improve areas of services that our 
						Customers find valuable.  While both of these activities depend on the use of cookies, you have the option of disabling the cookies 
						via your browser preferences.
					</p>
					<p class="font12Bold">
						With whom do we share your Information?
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						As a general rule we will not disclose any specific personal information that you submit to us about you ("Personal Information") in 
						a manner that connects you with the Personal Information, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as 
						when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the 
						ways that your Personal Information may be disclosed.
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						Business Partners &amp; Sponsors: We may disclose some or all of your Personal Information to business partners or sponsors, but this use 
						will be specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data.  Many promotions offer opportunities 
						to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give us permission to transfer your Personal 
						Information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your e-mail address will be shared.  If more 
						Personal Information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						Third Party &amp; Aggregate Data: From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third 
						parties.  If you opt to receive information from these third parties, we will (with your permission) share your name and e-mail address 
						with such third parties.  Under confidentiality agreements, we may match Personal Information with third party data.  Also, we may keep 
						track of what portions of the Web site Customers are visiting and other Customer statistics, and aggregate this information to help us 
						create a better experience for users of our Web site.  This is all done without knowing your name or other Personal Information in order 
						to describe our viewers and services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						Other: We may also disclose account Information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this Information is 
						necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our terms of use or terms of service, or may 
						be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of our rights or property, other Customers, or 
						anyone else.  We may disclose or access account Information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative 
						and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.
					</p>
					<p class="font12Bold">
						How can you control the usage of Information?
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						In case you change your mind or some Personal Information changes (such as your zip code or e-mail address), we will try to provide a way 
						to correct, update or remove the Personal Information that you give us. We also give you the opportunity to control the communications we 
						direct to you.  We offer Customers the opportunity to "opt out" of having Personal Information shared with parties outside of our company 
						or our affiliated companies.  If a Customer wishes to update Personal Information or objects to any usage provided herein for any reason, 
						he/she may update the information via the <a href="MyAccount.aspx">"My Account"</a> interface or if he/she has problems doing that he/she may 
						e-mail the requested change to:  <a href="mailto:realty.webmaster@sothebysrealty.com">realty.webmaster@sothebysrealty.com</a>
					</p>
					<p class="font12Bold">
						What happens when you link to a third party site?
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						You should be aware that when you are on our sites you could hyperlink or be directed to other sites that are beyond our control and/or 
						outside our service.  For example, if you "click" on an affiliate's local website link, the "click" will transfer you off the sothebysrealty.com 
						site.  These other sites may include sites of advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use our affiliates' or our logo as part of a 
						co-branding agreement.  These other sites may send their own cookies to Customers, collect data, or solicit Information.
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						We do not control such sites, and, therefore, are not responsible for their contents or the hyperlinks or advertising they choose to place 
						on such sites.  Our inclusion of hyperlinks to these sites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such sites or any association 
						with their operators.  Our policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, which is beyond our control.
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						Please keep in mind that whenever you give out information online (for example, via message boards or chat) that information can be collected 
						and used by people you don't know.  While we strive to protect our Customers' information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any 
						information you disclose online, and you disclose such information at your own risk.
					</p>
					<p class="font12Bold">
						Is your Information secure from others using our site?
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						The importance of security of all information associated with our Customers is an important concern to us.  Unfortunately, no data transmission 
						over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we can't ensure or warrant the 
						security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your 
						transmission, we use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, such as firewalls.  However, "perfect 
						security" does not exist on the Internet.
					</p>
					<p class="font12Bold">
						YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS
					</p>
					<p class="font11Regular">
						By using this site, you signify your agreement to our Privacy Policy. <b>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SITE.</b> 
						Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
