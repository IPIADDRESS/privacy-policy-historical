    <h2>Sorenson Media, Inc. Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy and Agreement ("Privacy Policy") will tell you what
    information we collect about you and about your use of our Web site. It
    will explain how we protect that information and what choices you have
    about how it is used. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully so
    that you will understand clearly how Sorenson Media may collect and use
    information provided by you because, by using the Sorenson Media Web site,
    you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h4 class="mmt">Sorenson Media will inform you of the following in this
      privacy policy:</h4>

    <ul class="list mb">
      <li>What personally identifiable information of yours is collected;</li>
      <li>What organization is collecting the information;</li>
      <li>How the information is used;</li>
      <li>With whom the information may be shared;</li>
      <li>What choices are available regarding collection, use, and distribution
        of the information;</li>
      <li>What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss,
        misuse, or alteration of information under our control; and, how you can
        correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please remember that any information (including information of a
    financial and/or other personal nature) that you reveal in a Sorenson
    Media public forum (such as a bulletin board, posting, chat room/event) is
    not protected by this Privacy Policy and that such postings will be seen
    by third parties not related to Sorenson Media. Also, what you've written
    in a Sorenson Media public forum could be used by others in ways we are
    unable to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized
    purposes. Also, if you access a third party site from a link on Sorenson
    Media, please be aware that any information you reveal on that site is not
    subject to this Privacy Policy and, therefore, you should consult the
    privacy policies of each site you visit.</p>

    <h4 class="mmt">I. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY SORENSON MEDIA OR ON SORENSON
      MEDIA'S BEHALF.</h4>

    <h5>A. In General</h5>

    <p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII or Personal Information) is
    information that can be used to identify or contact you. We collect the
    Personal Information that you provide to us in two general and distinct
    ways: (1) when you choose to purchase various services or products offered
    by Sorenson Media and/or its affiliated business partners, or (2) when you
    choose to participate in surveys or send e-mails to Sorenson Media. We
    also collect non-personal information from you and about your use of our
    Web site, e-mails, special promotions and newsletters that we may send to
    you, and Web sites of selected sponsors and advertisers. To no longer
    receive e-mails or other electronic communications from Sorenson Meda, you
    must elect to opt-out.</p>

    <h5>B. Registration And Other Information.</h5>

    <p>You may view or use our Web site without registering or submitting any
    Personal Information. In that case, the only information we collect will
    be non-personal information collected through the use of cookies or web
    beacons (see details below).</p>

    <p>However, in order to have access to certain products and services
    available on Sorenson Media's Web site, you are required to complete a
    registration form and provide other information reasonably necessary for
    us to provide the products and/or services for you. Some examples of the
    information we collect in the Registration form are:</p>

    <ul class="list mb">
      <li>Your Name</li>
      <li>Your Address(es)</li>
      <li>Your Phone Number(s)</li>
      <li>Your E-mail Address(es)</li>
      <li>Your Login Name</li>
      <li>Your Password</li>
      <li>Pages Viewed</li>
      <li>Your Credit Card Number(s)</li>
      <li>Your Customers' IP Address(es)</li>
      <li>Your Operating System/Machine Type</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>C. Cookies</h5>

    <p>We also collect anonymous, non-confidential, and non-personal
    information when you use our site, send us e-mails, or respond to special
    promotions or newsletters that we may send to you from time to time. For
    example, cookies are small computer files that we transfer to your
    computer's hard drive that allow us to know how often someone visits a
    site and the activities they conduct while on that site (such as the
    chatrooms you visited, whether you submitted orders for services or
    products, etc.). Every computer is assigned a different cookie by Sorenson
    Media. The information collected by cookies helps us dynamically generate
    advertising and content on web pages or in e-mails specifically designed
    for you and also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are
    using our site and selected affiliated business partners sites, or are
    opening our e-mails. We may use cookie information to target certain
    advertisements to your browser or to determine the popularity of certain
    content or advertisements. It may be possible to link non-personal cookie
    information to Personal Information collected.</p>

    <h5>D. Web Beacons</h5>

    <p>In limited circumstances we also may use "web beacons" to collect
    anonymous, non-personal information about your use of our Web site and the
    sites of selected affiliated partners, and your use of e-mails, special
    promotions or newsletters we may send to you from time to time. Web
    beacons are tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or e-mail that
    provide a presence on the web page or e-mail and send back to its home
    server information from the Users' browser. The information collected by
    web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using
    our site and selected affiliated business partners sites, or are opening
    our e-mails, and for what purposes. It may be possible to link
    non-personal web beacon information to Personal Information collected.</p>

    <h5>E. E-mails and Newsletters</h5>

    <p>As noted in the discussions of cookies and web beacons (see above), we
    collect anonymous, non-personal information about your use of e-mails and
    newsletters that we may send to you from time to time. In some cases, when
    you click on a link or an advertisement in an e-mail or newsletter, your
    browser may be momentarily directed to the site of a third party which,
    acting on Sorenson Media's behalf (see Disclosure to Web site Service and
    Content Contractors, below), notes or "counts" your response to the e-mail
    or newsletter before re-directing your browser to its proper destination.
    This re-direction process will not be apparent to you.</p>

    <h5>F. Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on Sorenson
      Media's Behalf.</h5>

    <p>Sponsors, business partners or advertisers on the Sorenson Media's site
    or in e-mails, special promotions or newsletters we may send to you from
    time to time may also use their own cookies or web beacons when you click
    on their advertisement or link to their site or service, or even if the
    advertisement simply appears on a page or in an e-mail that you are
    viewing. Some advertisers use companies other than Sorenson Media to serve
    their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad
    Servers") may also collect non-personal information through the use of
    cookies or web beacons on our Web site. In certain situations, information
    collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the
    site of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the sponsor,
    business partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its
    proper destination (e.g., back to Sorenson Media to show the ad, or to the
    advertiser's Web site); this re-direction process will not be apparent to
    you.</p>

    <p>We do not control these third parties' use of cookies or web beacons,
    or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through them.
    However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect
    cookie or web beacon information through our Web site to agree that they
    will not collect any Personal Information from our site without your
    consent. They have promised us they will not link any non-personal cookie
    or web beacon information collected by them on our site to Personal
    Information they or others collect in other ways or from other sites.
    However, you should review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or
    link to from our site to understand how these other sites use cookies and
    how they use the information they collect through the use of cookies or
    web beacons on their own sites.</p>

    <h5>G. Public Forums</h5>

    <p>This Privacy Policy does not protect you when you use Sorenson Media's
    public forums if and when they become available. As a service to our
    users, Sorenson Media may feature chat rooms and bulletin boards where
    users can share information and support one another or where users can
    post questions for other users to answer. You should be aware that any
    information shared in a chat room, bulletin board, or other type of
    posting is public information and may be seen, disclosed to or collected
    by third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy. You should
    think carefully before disclosing any personal information in any public
    forum.</p>

    <h5>H. E-mails to Sorenson Media</h5>

    <p>This Privacy Policy does not protect you when you send business
    information, resumes, ideas, concepts or inventions to Sorenson Media by
    e-mail to the various Sorenson Media's departments listed on the Sorenson
    Media's Web site. If you want to keep business information, resumes,
    ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in
    an e-mail to Sorenson Media. We try to answer every e-mail in a timely
    manner, but are not always able to do so.</p>

    <h4 class="mmt">II. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION.</h4>

    <p>A. Except as set forth in this paragraph II, or as specifically agreed
    to by you, Sorenson Media will not use, disclose, or store any Personal
    Information it gathers from you on our Web site unless reasonably required
    in order to answer your questions, to provide products and/or services you
    may request or purchase from our Web site (such as, information we need to
    share with our credit card internet gateway), or unless reasonably
    required in order to comply with a governmental or Sorenson Media company
    record-keeping requirement.</p>

    <p>We may release Personal Information to third parties: (1) to comply
    with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant,
    subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as a financial
    threat to you or others. In the event that we are legally compelled to
    disclose your Personal Information to a third party, we will notify you
    unless doing so would violate the law or court order.</p>

    <h5>B. Disclosure to Sorenson Media's Subsidiaries/Affiliated
      Entities.</h5>

    <p>Sorenson Media may disclose Personal Information to its corporate
    subsidiaries or entities affiliated with Sorenson Media. Any Personal
    Information provided to Sorenson Media's subsidiaries or entities
    affiliated with Sorenson Media will be treated by those subsidiaries and
    affiliated entities in accordance with the terms of this Privacy
    Policy.</p>

    <h5>C. Disclosure to Sorenson Media's Operations and Maintenance
      Contractors</h5>

    <p>Sorenson Media's operations and maintenance contractors may sometimes
    have limited access to your Personal Information in the course of
    providing products or services to Sorenson Media. These contractors
    include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services,
    and/or content related to better operation and maintenance of our Web
    site. These contractors also may have access to your e-mail address to
    send newsletters or special promotions to you on our behalf or to send
    e-mails to you for purposes such as conducting market research on our
    behalf. Access to your Personal Information by these contractors is
    limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the
    contractor to perform its limited function for Sorenson Media. We also
    contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors (1)
    protect the privacy of your Personal Information, and (2) not use or
    disclose your Personal Information for any purpose other than providing us
    with products and services.</p>

    <h5>D. Disclosure to Web site Service and Content Contractors</h5>

    <p>Certain content and products and services offered to you through our
    Web site are served on Web sites hosted and operated by a company other
    than Sorenson Media ("Third Party Contractor Web sites"). Therefore, if
    you purchase services or products through one of these Third Party
    Contractor Web sites, you will be purchasing it from the Third Party
    Contractor and not from Sorenson Media. Further, you should be aware that
    any information you disclose once you access these other sites is not
    subject to this Privacy Policy. Sorenson Media does not endorse and is not
    responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Contractor Web
    sites and, therefore, you should review the privacy policy posted on the
    other site to understand how that Third Party Contractor Web site collects
    and uses your Personal Information. Also, if you have reason to believe
    that you may be leaving our Web site and entering a Third Party Contractor
    Web site, you should be cautious about providing any personal information
    until you have reviewed the privacy policy posted on the other site.</p>

    <h5>E. Disclosure To Or By Co-branded Channel Partners</h5>

    <p>Sorenson Media is a contractor and provides co-branded products and/or
    services to Web sites hosted and operated by companies other than Sorenson
    Media ("Channel Partner Web sites"). You can only access these co-branded
    content and products and/or services through the Channel Partner Web site.
    The co-branded Sorenson Media pages that you may access through a Channel
    Partner Web site have different registration processes and opportunities
    for information collection, and Personal Information that you provide on
    these pages may be shared with the Channel Partners. Each of these
    co-branded Sorenson Media sites has its own privacy policy posted on that
    site. Therefore, if you visit one of these co-branded Sorenson Media
    sites, please read the privacy policy that is posted on that site, as well
    as the individual privacy policy of the Channel Partner Web site.</p>

    <h5>F. Disclosure to Linked Sites</h5>

    <p>In addition to the Third Party Contractor Web sites that you may access
    as described above, for your convenience there are links to Web sites
    operated by companies other than Sorenson Media ("Third Party Web sites")
    that are not contractors who provide content, products, and/or services
    through our Web site. These links may be found in advertisements,
    referenced within content, or placed beside the names or logos of sponsors
    or affiliated business partners of Sorenson Media. Sorenson Media does not
    disclose your Personal Information to these Third Party Web sites without
    obtaining your consent. Sorenson Media does not endorse and is not
    responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. If you choose to
    link to one of these Third party Web sites, you should review the privacy
    policy posted on this other site to understand how that Third Party Web
    site collects and uses your Personal Information.</p>

    <h5>G. Disclosure of Aggregate Information</h5>

    <p>Sorenson Media may provide to third parties non-personal information
    about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted and that
    is combined with the non-personal information of other users ("Aggregate
    Information"). For example, we might inform third parties regarding the
    number of users of our site and the activities they conduct while on our
    site. We might also inform a company that performs services or that
    provides products and/or services to Sorenson Media (that may or may not
    be a Sorenson Media business partner or an advertiser on our site) that
    "50% of our users live in the USA" or that "85% of our users have
    purchased products and/or services which can be downloaded from Sorenson
    Media's Web site." Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not
    charge third parties for this Aggregate Information. We also may not limit
    the third parties' use of the Aggregate Information, except that we do
    require third parties to whom we disclose Aggregate Information to agree
    that they will not attempt to make this information personally
    identifiable by combining it with other databases or otherwise.</p>

    <h4 class="mmt">III. HOW SORENSON MEDIA HANDLES PRIVACY AND SECURITY
      INTERNALLY.</h4>

    <p>Sorenson Media wants your Personal Information to remain as secure as
    possible. That is why we have a two-tier security system at Sorenson Media
    that combines leading technical safeguards and a code of conduct for those
    personnel who are permitted to access our customers' Personal Information.
    On the technical side, Sorenson Media uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
    encryption technology in transmitting your Personal Information to our
    servers to help ensure the integrity and privacy of the Personal
    Information you provide to us via the Internet. Encryption involves
    systematically scrambling numbers and letters, so that even if someone
    managed to intercept the information, they would not be able to make sense
    of it. In order to take advantage of this encryption technology, you need
    to have an Internet browser that will support 128-bit encryption, such as
    Netscape or Microsoft Explorer. As an additional security measure, your
    Personal Information is also kept physically separate on a separate server
    where your password is encrypted and stored on a database. On the
    personnel side, only a limited number of Sorenson Media personnel are
    authorized to access your Personal Information. All Sorenson Media
    personnel must abide by our Privacy Policy and those who violate our
    Privacy Policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
    termination. Although we will make every reasonable effort to protect your
    Personal Information from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties,
    you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in
    transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that
    thieves could find a way to thwart our security systems.</p>

    <h4 class="mmt">IV. YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES.</h4>

    <p>When you complete Registration, you will be given the option of
    receiving recurring informational/promotional e-mails from Sorenson Media
    and/or third parties. You may opt out of receiving e-mails from or on
    behalf of Sorenson Media at Registration by removing the automatic check
    mark from the statement that expresses a preference for receiving these
    e-mails and newsletters. You may also opt out of receiving these e-mails
    and newsletters at any time. When you have received a newsletter you wish
    to stop, click on the "reply" button in your mail program, then type in
    the word "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the "Subject" field and send. Sorenson Media's
    Customer Service will unsubscribe you.</p>

    <p>At Registration, you may also have the option of receiving e-mails or
    newsletters from third parties, participating in research or marketing
    surveys and participating in other activities. You may exercise these
    options by placing a check mark beside a statement that expresses a
    preference for receiving these communications or participating in these
    activities. You may change your decision at any time by following the
    directions regarding how to unsubscribe from these e-mails or
    newsletters.</p>

    <p>This privacy statement applies only to the Sorenson Media's Web site.
    The Sorenson Media Web site does contain links to other sites. Once you
    enter another Web site (whether through an advertisement, service, or
    content link), be aware that Sorenson Media is not responsible for the
    privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to look for and
    review the privacy statements of each and every Web site that you visit
    through a link or advertisement on Sorenson Media's Web site or any site
    that collects Personal Information from you.</p>


    <h4 class="mmt">V. UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND CONTACTING
      SORENSON MEDIA.</h4> <p>You can always contact us in order to (1) delete
    your Personal Information from our systems, (2) update the Personal
    Information that you have provided to us, and (3) change your preferences
    with respect to marketing contacts or other activities, by e-mailing us at
    support@sorensonmedia.com. Such changes will not have any effect on other
    information that Sorenson Media maintains. If you have a complaint or
    problem you may e-mail us at support@sorensonmedia.com and the customer
    service department will forward your complaint to the appropriate internal
    Sorenson Media department for a response or resolution. We try to answer
    every e-mail in a timely manner but are not always able to do so.</p>

    <p>You should be aware that it may not be technologically possible to
    remove each and every record of the information you have provided to
    Sorenson Media from our servers. The need to back-up our systems to
    protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your
    Personal Information may exist in a non-erasable form that may be
    difficult or impossible for us to locate. Nevertheless, upon receiving
    your request, we will endeavor to delete all Personal Information stored
    in the databases we actively use for research and daily business
    activities, as well as other readily searchable media.</p>

    <p>Privacy as it applies to the Internet is a dynamic, rapidly developing
    area. Therefore, in the future, we may make significant changes to our
    privacy policy affecting the use of the Personal Information you provide
    to us. Therefore, you need to ensure that you visit our Web site from time
    to time and read our Privacy Policy in effect to see if we have made any
    significant changes concerning our use of your Personal Information.</p>

    <p>We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that
    generally will not affect our use of your Personal Information and,
    therefore, you should also check our posted Privacy Policy for any
    non-significant changes. Further, if you do not agree to the terms of this
    Privacy Policy or any revised policy, you should exit the site
    immediately.</p>
