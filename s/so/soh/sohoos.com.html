If so, SohoOS will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at www.SohoOS.com and we may send registered users an email, so you are always aware of what information, including personally identifiable information, we may collect and how we may use this information.

						<p>
    <b>Cookies</b><br>
		When you use or access the SohoOS Site we may use small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters called cookies to improve overall Site experience, among other things. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you.

		"Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings and to remove cookies. We may also use web beacons on our site and in emails that we send to you. We may collect information regarding pages visited, searches performed, actions made
    </p>
						<p>
    <b>*Automatically Collected Information:* </b><br>
		When you access the Site or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology, including server logs. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique device or user ID, version of software installed, system type, browser used, the content and pages that you access on the Site, the dates and times that you visit the Site, actions that you made and items that you clicked on.<br><br>
		Like most Web sites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These "server logs" typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
    </p>
						<p>
    <b>Aggregate Information</b><br>
		The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, browser type, and IP addresses, and we may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
    </p>
						<p>
    <b>Disclosure</b><br>

(Please note that SohoOS reserves the right to assert that only the court in Israel have jurisdiction, and subpoenas from outside those jurisdictions must be "domesticated," though we are not obligated to do so.)<br><br> 
		We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization; however, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which SohoOS participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of SohoOS's assets to which this Site relates.
