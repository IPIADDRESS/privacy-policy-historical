<p class="style1"><strong>Your privacy is important to  SolarCity. The following Privacy Policy discloses the information practices  followed by SolarCity with respect to your personal information gathered to  help us assess your request for a leased solar panel system and with respect to  SolarCity’s public website, including the type of information that we gather,  the way we use information internally and our policy regarding sharing  information with others.</strong></p>
<p class="style1">We have  implemented these practices for the SolarCity Home Page (www.solarcity.com) and  its dependent pages. We have instructed our website administrator to include  information regarding these privacy practices on each location of the SolarCity  website where personal information is collected.</p>
<p class="style1">Portions of  this privacy policy may be governed by the supplemental MapPoint Web &amp;  Virtual Earth Service Privacy Policy at <a href="http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/maps.aspx" target="_blank">http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/maps.aspx</a> for site content displaying a visual mapping service.</p>
<p class="style1">We  encourage you to read this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Collection and Use of Personal  Information</strong></p>
<p class="style1">Personal  information gathered on our public website means any information that is  related to an identified person, or that may be used to identify an individual,  including, but not limited to: first and last name; email address; a home,  postal or other physical address or other contact information; title, birth  date, gender, occupation, industry, or personal interests; and other  information necessary or useful to provide a product or service that you have  requested. For customers interested in SolarCity’s lease offering, we collect  personal information from you or others on your behalf, on our credit  evaluation request and other forms, including identifying information such as  name, address, telephone number, date of birth, Social Security Number, bank  routing information, and credit related information such as your outstanding  mortgages.  We also receive information  about you from consumer reporting agencies such as credit history and capacity.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Protecting Personal Information  </strong></p>
<p class="style1">Personal  information gathered about customers interested in leasing a solar panel system  is only accessible by appropriate personnel who have a business need for the  information.  We provide training and  communication programs to educate our personnel about the meaning and  requirements of this privacy statement.   We use systems, policies and procedures to maintain the accuracy of  customer information and to protect it from loss, misuse, or alteration.  </p>
<p class="style1"><strong>How We Use Personal Information  </strong></p>

We use personal information to meet your  requests for solar panel system financing, for solar panel system products and  services, and to comply with legal requirements.  In striving to serve you, we sometimes share  customer information with others so they may help us by providing services to  us or by providing services on our behalf or jointly with us to you.  <em>We  do not sell personal information about you to unrelated companies for their  independent use.  </em></p>
