This Privacy Policy forms an integral part of any applicable Terms of Use and End User License Agreements and should be read in conjunction with them. </p>
    
    <h2><b>I. Introduction</b></h2>
    <p>For the purpose of this Policy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“<b>Personal Information</b>” means your name, email address, telephone number, picture, or any other information that may be used to identify You as an individual. </li>
        <li>“<b>Anonymous Information</b>” means technical information from your computer which does not enable identification of You as an individual user. </li>

    </ul>
        
    <h2><b>II. How Soluto Collects and Uses Your Personal Information</b></h2>
    <p>This section is designed to provide You with information on how we collect and store your Personal Information. </p>
    <p>You do not need to provide any Personal Information to Soluto in order to have access to our Site. However, in certain cases, You will be required to create a profile on our Site if You wish to interact with the site, such as in the following ways:</p>
    
    <ul>

        <li> Posting in Soluto’s support forums; and</li>
        <li> Using Soluto’s Service to provide support to another user.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If You create a profile, certain information by default will be viewable by the public (“<b>Public Profile Information</b>”). Certain other information will only be viewable by users who You support using Soluto’s Service (“<b>Limited Profile Information”</b>). Certain profile information will only be viewable by You (“<b>Private Profile Information</b>”). Examples of these three categories of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Public Profile Information: Your profile nickname, your photo and “about me” information. These portions of your profile will be viewable to the public. Any contributions You make to the Soluto Wiki and any of your posts in Soluto’s support forums will be linked to your public profile so You can receive credit to your contributions.</li>

    </li></ul>

    <p>For Supporters: if You invite another user to support through Soluto’s Service, You will need to provide Soluto with the email addresses for any users You wish to support. For Supportees: your Supporter will invite You to the Soluto Service by providing your email address to Soluto. This is necessary for Soluto to send You an invitation to use the service. </p>
    <p>If You sign up for any newsletters, emails, or if You respond to any surveys on the Site, You will need to provide Soluto with your email address so we can respond to You via email.</p>
    <p>If You purchase any products or services from Soluto, You will provide Soluto or a designated third party payment processor with your payment details (such as your credit card number, billing address, etc.) in order for Soluto to complete the transaction with You.</p>
    <p>Any Personal Information provided to Soluto will be collected, used and stored by Soluto in order to provide our Site, Software and Services to You. </p>

    <h2>III. <b>How Soluto Collects and Uses Anonymous Information from Your PC</b></h2>
    <p>When You install and run Soluto’s Software on your PC, the Software collects, aggregates and transmits technical information about your PC to Soluto so Soluto can provide its Service to its users. Soluto uses this Anonymous Information:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>To generate crowdsourced PC support recommendations, based on aggregated support actions performed by other Soluto users;</li>
        <li>To create the PC Genome, a publicly editable database of hardware and software information collected from millions of Soluto users (the “<b>PC Genome</b>”);</li>
        <li>To analyze real-world PC performance and compatibility using aggregated statistical PC information; and</li>
        <li>To provide information regarding PC health and status to Supporters who are performing PC support actions through the Soluto Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This Anonymous Information may include: technical information regarding the hardware and software installed on your PC; PC performance, health, security and update status; technical data regarding PC crashes and user frustration events; information regarding the type of Internet connection, ISP name, country and city; information relating to the installation or uninstallation of hardware and software on the PC and processes running at boot; browser type and configuration; and information regarding the use of Soluto’s Software. </p>

    <p>Anonymous Information from your PC will be collected by Soluto’s Software and transmitted for storage in the PC Genome. In the aggregate, this information will be available in statistical form for other users to view and edit. Soluto also reserves the right to use, share or provide aggregated or statistical Anonymous Information with third parties. Anonymous information will be shared between the Supporter and Supportee who have an active support relationship using the Soluto Service in order to provide support using the Service. </p>
