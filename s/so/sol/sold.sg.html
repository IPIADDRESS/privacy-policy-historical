      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
We  are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.<br>
<br>
sold.sg  collects User Data from you in order to provide you with a safe,  smooth, efficient and customized experience with sold.sg. The  collection of User Data enables sold.sg to provide services and  products that are most likely to meet your needs and requirements.
<br>
As  such, this Private Policy outlines sold.sg’s policy and  responsibility in relation to the collection, processing and  disclosure of your User Data.<br>
<br>
GENERAL  USER DATA PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT<br>
<br>


<br><h4>Types of User Data</h4>

The types of User Data that  sold.sg collects depends on the circumstances of collection and on  the nature of the service requested or transaction undertaken. There  are two broad categories of User Data that we collect at sold.sg:<br>
<br>
Individual  		User Data which is personal information that links back to an  		individual e.g. name, address, phone number and email address etc.,  		; and<br>
<br>
Statistical  		Data e.g. hits to website. This is stored purely for analytical  		purposes and is entirely anonymous. This information will not be  		stored to your User record and will only be aggregated for  		statistical analysis so that we can better understand sold.sg’s  		users profile and improve sold.sg service offering.<br>
<br>
For purposes of this policy  statement, the phrase User Data includes individual and statistical  data.<br>
<br>


<br><h4>PURPOSE  	FOR COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND DISCLOSURE</h4>
<h4>Collection</h4>

<br>

Marketing  	and communicating with you in relation to available products for bid  	and services offered by sold.sg, and our affiliated service  	providers;<br>
Safety,  	security and legal compliance.<br>
<br>

<br><h4>Processing  and Disclosure</h4>

We do not sell, trade, or  otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable  information.<br>
<br>
We may process and disclose  your User Data with and to third parties, such as delivery service  providers, products suppliers or business-related parties. sold.sg  shall use its best endeavor to ensure that its employees, officers,  agents, consultants, contractors and such other parties mentioned  above who are involved in the collection, processing and disclosure  of User Data will observe and adhere to the terms of this Privacy  Policy.<br>

Further, sold.sg may disclose User Data as is  necessary to prevent a threat to sold.sg and to investigate suspected  unlawful activities including but not limited to fraud, intellectual  property infringement or privacy.<br>
<br>

<br>

However, if and when required by law,  sold.sg will adopt an “opt-in” policy for attaining users  consent, in which event, express written consent will be sought from  users when collecting your User Data e.g. signing a form or checking  a box.<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
