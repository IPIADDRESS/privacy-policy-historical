<b>Views of the Solar System</b><br>

If this does occur, Views of the Solar System or its advertising agents may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request.

<b>What are cookies and why do we use them?</b><br>
A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time a Views of the Solar System
advertising agent utilising this technology serves you an ad. For example, one of our network
advertising agencies Flycast Communications issues a unique number from its banner engine,
which is stored in a cookie file on your computer. This cookie can help Flycast target ads
to you, reducing multiple ad views. While we believe cookies enhance your Internet experience
by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to
you, they are not required for Views of the Solar System to deliver Flycast advertising banners to you.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="Arial">

If you do not want the benefit of the Flycast network cookie, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="Arial">
