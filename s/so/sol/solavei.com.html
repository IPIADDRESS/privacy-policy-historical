    <h1>Solavei, LLC Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>The effective date of this Solavei, LLC Privacy Policy is November 30, 2011.</p>
    <p> Because we want you to understand the collections and uses of data that are necessary and possible on the Solavei platform, and to show our respect for your privacy, we have established this Solavei Privacy Policy. </p>
    <h2>Collected Information</h2>
    <p>In the registration process, we collect registration information from our users, including name and contact information such as email and mailing address. Each of these different types of information is used to provide users with updates on Solavei’s activities.</p>
    <h2>Shared Information</h2>
    <p>We will not share your personal or business information except as described below:</p>
    <p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may offer you products or services that may be of interest to you. In other situations, Solavei may provide services, or sell services jointly with affiliated businesses. You will be able to easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with a particular opportunity or transaction, and we will share user information that is related to that opportunity or transaction with that affiliated business.</p>
    <p>Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include sending email, analyzing data, and providing user services. Without your permission, Solavei's agents do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>
    <p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Solavei, or substantially all of its assets or capital stock were acquired (via merger or otherwise), or in the event that Solavei goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Solavei may continue to use your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Protection of Solavei and Others: We may release personal and business information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with law; enforce or apply our Privacy Policy, and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Solavei, our employees, our users, or others. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</p>
    <p>With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personally identifiable individual information may be shared with third parties, and will be given the option to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
    <h2>Customer Surveys</h2>
    <p>Solavei may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if a third party conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.</p>
    <p>We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our customer surveys and aggregate it with the responses from other customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally-identifying information may be shared with third parties.</p>
