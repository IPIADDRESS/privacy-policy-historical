        In order to offer some of SolidTrust Pay's services and reduce fraud, SolidTrust Pay
        (SolidTrust Pay or "we") will ask you to provide information
        about yourself and your credit card and/or bank account. This Privacy Policy describes
        the information we collect and how we use that information.<br><br> SolidTrust Pay takes
        the security of your personal information very seriously and will use your information
        only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will not sell or rent
        your personally identifiable information or a list of our customers to third parties.
        However, as described in more detail in Part C below, there are limited circumstances
        in which some of your information will be shared with third parties, under strict
        restrictions, so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy.<br><br> This Privacy
        Policy applies to all services that are hosted on the SolidTrust Pay website,
        whether SolidTrust Pay (or its subsidiaries or one of its affiliates) offers the services.
        By accepting the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use in registration, you expressly consent to
        our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner described in
        this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the
        terms of the SolidTrust Pay Terms of Use.<br><br>
        Your personal information will be stored and processed
        on our computers in Canada. The laws on holding personal data in
        Canada may be less stringent than the laws of your country, but SolidTrust Pay
        will hold and transmit your personal information in a safe, confidential and secure environment.
        If you object to your personal information being transferred or used as described
        in this Privacy Policy, please do not register for the SolidTrust Pay service.<br><br><br>
        <strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
        This policy may be revised over time as new
        features are added to the SolidTrust Pay service or as we incorporate suggestions from
        our customers. If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information
        in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information,
        you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. Any
        material changes will be effective only after we notify you via e-mail with at
        least 30 days notice of the amended Privacy Policy (if you have closed your
        SolidTrust Pay account, you will not be contacted and
        your personal information will not be used or disclosed in this new manner).<br><br>
        We will post the amended Privacy Policy prominently on our website so that you can always
        review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether
        we will disclose it to anyone. Please check the SolidTrust Pay website at <a href="http://solidtrustpay.com">SolidTrust Pay </a>
        at any time for the most current version of our Privacy Policy.<br><br>
        Pages on the SolidTrust Pay website may include links to third party websites. SolidTrust Pay is
        not responsible for their operations, including but not limited to their information
        practices. Their privacy statements govern those sites. Users submitting information
        to or through these third party websites should review the privacy statement of
        these sites before providing them with personally identifiable information.

      <a id="b"><br><strong><u>B. Information We Collect</u></strong></a>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Required Information</strong><br>
        To open a SolidTrust Pay account, you must
        provide your name, company name (if any), address, phone number,
        and e-mail address. In order to make payments through SolidTrust Pay, you may, but are not required to, provide credit
        card, debit card or bank account information. We may also ask you to choose different
        security questions to answer. This required information may be necessary for us to
        process transactions, issue a new password if you forget or lose your password, protect
        you against credit card and checking account fraud, and to contact you should
        the need arise in administering your account.<br><br>
        If you choose to register or apply for certain optional features
        or products offered through the SolidTrust Pay website, you will be required to provide
        additional information to establish that you qualify for such features or products.<br><br>
        <strong>Transaction Information</strong><br>
        When you use SolidTrust Pay to send money
        to someone else or request money from someone else, we ask you to provide information
        related to each transaction, including the amount of the transaction and the
        username of the third party. We retain this information for each of your
        transactions through. We also collect the Internet address (IP address)
        of the computer or device you use to access your SolidTrust account, in order to help
        detect possible instances of unauthorized transactions.<br><br>
        <strong>Information About You From Third Parties</strong><br>
        In order to protect all our customers
        against potential fraud, we verify with third parties the information you provide.
        In the course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable information
        about you from such services. In particular, if you register a credit card or debit
        card with SolidTrust Pay, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services
        to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you
        supplied to SolidTrust Pay, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.<br><br>
        If you send or receive high overall payment volumes through SolidTrust Pay, in some circumstances
        we may conduct a background check on your business by obtaining information about
        you and your business from a credit bureau or a business information service. If
        you incur a debt to SolidTrust Pay, we will generally conduct a credit check on you
        by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, to the extent
        permitted by law. SolidTrust Pay, at its sole discretion, also reserves the right periodically
        to retrieve and review a business or consumer credit report for any account, and reserves
        the right to close an account based on information obtained during this credit
        review process.<br><br>
        <strong>Additional Verification</strong><br>
        If we cannot verify the information that
        you provide, or if you request a withdrawal by cheque to an address other than your
        verified physical address, we may ask you to send us additional information
        (such as your drivers license, credit card statement, and/or a recent
        utility bill or other information linking you to the applicable address), or to
        answer additional questions online to help verify your information.<br>
        <strong>Website Traffic Information</strong><br>
        Because of the way that Internet communication
        standards work, when you arrive at or leave the SolidTrust Pay website, we automatically
        receive the Internet address of the site that you came from or are going to. We
        also collect information on which pages of our website you visit while you are
        on the SolidTrust Pay site, the type of browser you use and the times you access our website.
        We may use this information only to try to understand our customer's preferences
        better and to manage the load on our servers, so as to improve our service and your
        experience with SolidTrust Pay. We do not track the websites that you visit before
        or after you leave the SolidTrust Pay site.<br>
        <strong>Our Use of Cookies</strong><br>
        Cookies are small files
        of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a SolidTrust Pay
        customer if you return to the SolidTrust Pay site using the same computer and browser.
        We send a session cookie to your computer if and when you log in
        to your SolidTrust Pay account by entering your e-mail address and password. These
        cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during
        the same session, so that you do not need to re-enter your password multiple
        times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire
        and no longer have any effect.<br><br>
        In addition, we use cookies to process our referral
        program, described in Section C below. We may share cookie information regarding
        whether or not a certain user is already registered with SolidTrust Pay with certain
        merchants with whom we have an official co-marketing relationship.<br><br>
        <strong>Customer Service Correspondence</strong><br>
        If you correspondence with us via phone, email, LiveChat or through the mail, we may
        retain such information in the records of your account. We may retain
        these records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate
        potential fraud and violations of our Terms of Use. We may, over time, delete
        these records if permitted by law.<br>
        <strong>Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data</strong><br>
        From time to time, we may offer
        optional questionnaires and surveys to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic
        information or assessing user interests and needs. The use of the information
        collected will be explained in detail in the survey itself. If we collect personally
        identifiable information from our users in these questionnaires and surveys, the
        users will be given notice of how the information will be used prior to their
        participation in the survey or questionnaire.<br>
       <!-- <strong>Non-member Recipients and Requests</strong><br />
        When a member either sends a payment to,
        or requests a payment from, an individual who is not a registered member of SolidTrust Pay,
        we will retain the information that the member submits to us, including, for example,
        the other party's email address and/or name, for the benefit of the member
        who is attempting to contact the non-member, so that the member can see a complete
        record of his or her transactions, including uncompleted transactions. Although this
        information is stored indefinitely, we will not market to the non-member in any
        way at any time. Additionally, these non-members have the same rights to access and correct
        information about themselves (assuming that their email addresses were correct
        enough to reach them) as anyone else who uses SolidTrust Pay.-->

      <a id="c"><strong><u>C. Our Use and Disclosure of Information</u></strong></a>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Internal Uses</strong><br>
        We collect, store and process your personal
        information on servers located in Europe. We use the information
        we collect about you in order to provide our services and process your transactions,
        to provide customer service, to determine your eligibility to receive offers for
        special features or products, and to improve our products and services. At your option
        (as indicated in your SolidTrust Pay user settings), we use the information you
        provide to access specific third party services on your behalf and perform the
        actions that you request us to perform.<br><br>
        We give access to individually identifiable information about our users only to those employees
        who require it to fulfill customer service requests.<br><br>
        <strong>Disclosure to Other SolidTrust Pay Customers</strong><br>
        If you are a registered
        SolidTrust Pay user, your name, e-mail address, account type and verification status may be displayed
        to other SolidTrust Pay customers whom you have paid or who are attempting to pay you through
        SolidTrust Pay. Your credit card number, bank account and other financial information will never
        be revealed to anyone whom you have paid or who has paid you through SolidTrust Pay, except if we are
        required to do so pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process.<br><br>
        If you are buying goods or services and paying through SolidTrust Pay, the seller of the goods or
        services may request that you provide a mailing address that SolidTrust Pay has confirmed as matching
        the billing address in the credit card system. You do not have to provide this information. If you
        do not provide the information, however, the seller may choose not to accept your SolidTrust Pay
        payment and not to complete the transaction.<br><br>
        SolidTrust Pay may also disclose to other SolidTrust Pay customers the number of payments you have
        received from Verified SolidTrust Pay customers (as defined in the Terms of Use on the <a class="href" href="http://solidtrustpay.com">SolidTrust Pay</a>
        site), or other aggregate measures that provide an indication of your reputation with other
        SolidTrust Pay customers.<br><br>
        <strong>Disclosure to Third Parties Other Than SolidTrust Pay Customers </strong><br>
        SolidTrust Pay
        will NOT sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. SolidTrust Pay
        will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties except in the limited
        circumstances described below, or with your express permission (and to other SolidTrust Pay customers as
        described above). These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for
        secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is shared. We share information with
        companies that help us process the transactions you request and protect our customer's transactions
        from fraud, such as sharing your credit card number with a service that screens for lost and stolen card
        numbers. See <b>Information About You From Third Parties</b> in Section B above. Additionally,
        if you go into a negative balance and owe us money, we may share information with processing companies
        including collection agencies.<br><br>
        We disclose the information we collect, as described in Section B above, to companies that perform
        marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing
        agreements. These companies may be subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal
        restrictions that prohibit using the information except to market the specified SolidTrust Pay - related
        products or services, unless you have affirmatively agreed or given your prior permission for other
        uses.<br><br>
        We disclose information that we in good faith believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations
        of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use.
        Specifically, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has
        engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information
        (but not bank account or credit card information) to victims who request it.<br><br>
        We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment,
        order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas
        from private parties in a civil action.<br><br>

        We disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney
        that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).<br><br>
        We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For
        example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in British Columbia.
        However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information.<br><br>
        As with any other business, it is possible that SolidTrust Pay in the future could merge with
        or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have
        access to the information maintained by SolidTrust Pay, including customer account information,
        but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless an until it is amended as described in
        Section A above.<br><br>
        We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate
        the services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.<br><br>
        <strong>Our Contacts with SolidTrust Pay Customers</strong><br>
        We communicate with users on a regular
        basis via e-mail to provide requested services, and we also communicate by phone to resolve customer
        complaints or investigate suspicious transactions. We use your e-mail address to confirm your opening
        of a SolidTrust Pay account, to send you notice of payments that you send or receive through
        SolidTrust Pay (including referral payments described below), to send information about important
        changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures required by law.
        Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational
        in nature rather than promotional.<br><br>
        We also may use your e-mail address to send you other types of communications that you can control,
        including tips, newsletters, customer surveys and notice of special third-party promotions.<br><br>
        In connection with independent audits of our financial statements and operations, auditors may
        seek to contact a sample of our customers to confirm that our records are accurate. However, these
        auditors cannot use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br><br>
        <strong>Internet Address Information</strong><br>
        We use IP addresses, browser types and
        access times to analyze trends, administer the site, improve site performance and
        gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.<br><br>
        <strong>Your Use of Information and Our Services</strong><br>
        In order to facilitate the transactions
        between SolidTrust Pay members, our service allows you limited access other user's
        contact information. As a seller you may have access to the User ID, email address
        and other contact information of the purchaser, and as a purchaser you may have access
        to the User ID, email address and other contact information of the seller.<br><br>
        By entering into our Terms of Use, you agree that, with respect to other user's personally
        identifiable information that you obtain through the site or through an SolidTrust Pay-related
        communication or SolidTrust Pay-facilitated transaction, you will only use this information
        for: (a) SolidTrust Pay-related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages,
        (b) using services offered through SolidTrust Pay, and (c) any other purpose that such user
        expressly agrees to after adequate disclosure of the purpose(s).<br><br>
        In all cases, you must provide users with the opportunity to remove themselves from your database
        and review any information you have collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances,
        except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personally identifiable information

        <strong>Information Security</strong><br>
        SolidTrust Pay handles your customer information
        with high standards of information security. We restrict access to your personally
        identifiable information to employees who need to know that information in order
        to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural
        safeguards that comply with national regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.<br><br>
        The security of your SolidTrust Pay account also relies on your protection of your SolidTrust Pay
        password. You should not share your SolidTrust Pay password with anyone. SolidTrust Pay representatives
        will never ask you for your password, so any e-mail or other communication requesting
        your password should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious. If you do share your SolidTrust Pay
        password with a third party for any reason, including third party promises of providing you additional services such as account aggregation, the third
        party will have access to your account and your personal information, and you
        may be responsible for actions taken using your password. If you believe someone
        else has obtained access to your password, please change it immediately by logging
        in to your account at SolidTrust Pay and changing your passwords via your <b>SECURITY ZONE</b> area.
        Contact us right away as described in Section F below.

      <a id="e"><strong><u>E. Accessing and Changing Your Information</u></strong></a>
      <blockquote>
        You can review the personal information you have provided us and make select changes to such
        information, or to the settings for your SolidTrust Pay account, at any time by logging
        into your account on the SolidTrust Pay website and accessing your MY PROFILE area. You
        can also close your account by contacting us. If you close your
        SolidTrust Pay account, we will mark your account in our database as SUSPENDED
        but will keep your account information in our database. This is necessary in
        order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not
        be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account.
        However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will
        not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties,
        except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, or as required
        by law.
