 <h3>Sophos privacy policy</h3>
 
 <h4>General</h4>
 
 <p>This is the privacy policy of Sophos Plc ("Sophos").</p>
 
 <p>We, at Sophos, want to safeguard the privacy of visitors to our website
 ("the Site"). Please read the following policy to understand how we use your
 personal data. Our privacy policy may change from time to time, so please check
 it whenever you give us personal data.</p>
 
 <p>Whenever you give us personal data, you are consenting to its collection and
 use in accordance with our privacy policy. We will not share your personal
 information for marketing or any other purposes without your consent unless
 required by law.</p>
 
 <h4>What personal data does Sophos collect?</h4>
 
 <p>In general you can visit Sophos on the internet without telling us who you
 are or giving any personal information about yourself. However, when you start
 using our products and services, when you enquire about, order or evaluate our
 products or services, when you register for virus information alerts, when you
 register for one of our training programs or when you enter a competition you
 may be required to provide some personal data such as your name, company
 position, address, telephone number, mobile number, fax number, email address,
 credit card/debit card details and age. If you forward information to us
 electronically or as a hard copy, we will collect that information and use it
 for the purposes for which you have provided it. We will never collect
 sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. If you give us
 personal information about somebody else, such as a work colleague, we will
 assume that you have their permission.</p>
 
 <p>Every time you connect to the Site, we store a log of your visit that shows
 the unique number your machine uses when it is connected to the internet - its
 IP address. This tells us what your machine has looked at, whether the page
 request was successful or not and which browser your machine used to view the
 pages. The use of this data is primarily for statistical purposes. This helps
 us to understand which areas of the Site are of particular interest and also
 which pages are not being requested. It also tells how many people are visiting
 the Site in total.</p>
 
 <p>We would also attempt to contact you through these details if necessary
 including without limitation where you are using the wrong paths to access the
 Site or are breaching any restrictions on the use of the Site.  We may use this
 information to block IP addresses where there is a breach of the Terms and
 Conditions for use of the Site.</p>
 
 <h4>Cookies</h4>
 
 <p>A cookie is a piece of text that gets entered into the memory of your
 browser by a website. It allows a website to store information on a user's
 machine and later retrieve it.</p>
 
 <p>Sophos may use cookies from time to time. Some Sophos pages use cookies so
 that we can better serve you when you return to our site. You can set your
 browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to
 decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies.
 If you do so, however, some pages on Sophos website may not work properly.</p>
 
 <p>We do not use cookies to collect personal data about you.</p>
 
 <h4>How does Sophos use my personal data?</h4>
 
 <p>We use your personal data to provide goods and services to you, provide you
 with virus information alerts and to let you know about other goods and
 services in which you may be interested including alerting you to product
 upgrades, updates and renewal information. Your personal information may be
 used to improve the content of our website, provide goods and services, for
 marketing purposes, as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market
 research purposes or for other ancillary purposes.</p>
 
 <p>If you are making a job application or inquiry, you may provide us with a
 copy of your CV or other relevant information. We may use this information
 throughout Sophos for the purpose of consideration of your application or
 inquiry. Except where you tell us not to, we may keep this information on file
 for future reference.</p>
 
 <p>We may also use your personal data to carry out research about our users'
 demographics, interests and behaviour. We do this to better understand our
 users and potential users. This research is compiled and analysed on an
 aggregated basis. At no point is our users' personal identification information
 used in this research.</p>
 
 <p>Partners of Sophos may visit a specially allocated website. We may use
 information provided on that site to administer and develop our business
 relationship including the sharing of certain information (where permitted to
 do so) with associate companies other business partners, customers or
 prospects.</p>
 
 <p>As a global company, we have international sites and users all over the
 world. When you give us personal data, that data may be sent electronically to
 servers anywhere in the world and may be used, stored and processed anywhere in
 the world, including countries outside the European Economic Area. Whenever and
 wherever we collect, process or use personal data, we take steps to ensure that
 it is treated securely and in accordance with our privacy policy.</p>
 
 <h4>With whom might we share your personal data?</h4>
 
 <p>If you have registered your interest with Sophos or any of our associated
 companies, and thereby given your consent, you may be contacted with relevant
 promotions, offers or information that you have expressed an interest in or
 that might be of interest to you. There may also be other companies involved in
 the fulfilment of any request you make of Sophos. With Sophos you are always in
 control of your personal information, if at any time you wish us to stop
 contacting you then simply email us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@sophos.com">customerservice@sophos.com</a>
 providing us with your name and the information you wish to unsubscribe.</p>
 
 <p>We may pass your personal data to our group or associated companies or to
 our authorised resellers, partners and resellers some of whom may be located
 outside the European Economic Area, to provide you with goods and services
 which you have requested and to provide you with information about our group
 and associated companies' other products and services.</p>
 
 <p>We may also provide your personal data to companies (which are not companies
 in our group, associated companies, our partners or authorised resellers) which
 may be located outside the European Economic Area in order to provide you with
 information about other products or services. However, you may opt out of your
 personal data being used in this way when we ask for your data.</p>
 
 <p>Except as set out above, we will not disclose your personal information
 except where we are obliged to do so or allowed to do so, by law, or where we
 need to do so in order to run our business (for instance where we outsource
 services or other people process data for us). If you do not wish us to pass
 your information to any other carefully selected companies, please let us know
 by sending an email to us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@sophos.com">customerservice@sophos.com</a>.</p>
