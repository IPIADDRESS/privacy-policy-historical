        <p align="left">You can visit Suzuki 's Website to read product information 
          or use our online tools (calculators, configurators, etc.) without telling 
          us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only 
          information we collect and store during normal Website usage is the 
          name of your Internet service provider, the browser and type of machine 
          you are using, the Website that referred you to us, the pages you request 
          and the date and time of those requests. </p>
        <p align="left">We use this information to generate statistics and measure 
          site activity to improve the usefulness of customer visits. During normal 
          Website usage, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information 
          such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number or social 
          security number. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>

          (eg, e-newsletters, promotions, mailed brochures). This information, 
          such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, type of request and possibly 
          additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate 
          to the nature of the data by Suzuki and is used to fulfill your request. 
          Suzuki makes every effort to ensure the secure collection and transmission 
          of sensitive user information using industry-accepted data collection 
          and encryption methodologies such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and 
          PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). </p>

        <p align="left">Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers 
          to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes so that we 
          may track site and user activity. The use of cookies is an industry 
          standard and you will find them at most major Websites. By showing how

          the Finance and Buying Power Calculators - will not function properly 
          if you do so. However, we will not be able to recognize you as a visitor 
          over time. </p>
