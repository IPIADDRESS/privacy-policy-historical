        <p><em>Effective from August 22, 2014</em></p>

<p>At Sumdog, we take your privacy and online safety very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes what personal information we collect from you when you use Sumdog, and what we do with that information. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sumdog.com" class="external-link">privacy@sumdog.com</a>.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of <a href="/en/Terms_of_Use/">Sumdog's Terms of Use</a>. When you use Sumdog, you signify that you accept this Privacy Policy, as well as Sumdog's <a href="/en/Terms_of_Use/">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="PrivacyPolicy-Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>We do not ask children to enter any information that, by itself, is considered personal information.</p>

<p>Children aren't allowed to set up their own Sumdog account: we ask teachers and parents to make Student accounts for them. When they do this, they enter personal information both about themselves and the children.</p>

<p>When the children use Sumdog, we collect information - for example, about their educational performance.&nbsp;When they play writing games, we ask them not to enter any personal information. Sumdog does its best to enforce this rule automatically. To help provide the safest possible environment, we permit teachers and parents to view what each child has written.</p>

<p>We do not sell our users' information to other companies.</p>

<p>Now for the details...</p>

<h3><a name="PrivacyPolicy-StudentUsers"></a>Student Users</h3>

<p>If you are under 18,</p>

<ul>
	<li>you are only permitted to log in to Sumdog as a Student User;</li>
	<li>before you can log in as a Student User, a parent, guardian or teacher must create an account for you. They do this by first creating a parent or teacher account for themselves.</li>
	<li>we will not ask you to enter information that, by itself, is considered personal information.</li>
</ul>


<p>If we discover that we have collected personal information from anyone under 18 without permission from someone with the authority to give permission, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that this has happened, please contact us at privacy@sumdog.com.</p>

<h3><a name="PrivacyPolicy-Informationusersgiveus"></a>Information users give us</h3>

<p><b>All Users</b></p>

<p>All users can choose the gender and visual appearance of their on-screen avatar. They can also specify profile details, such as their favorite Sumdog game.</p>

<p>In order to provide the best possible service, we reserve the right to extend the types of information we ask users to give us. You can choose not to give us your information. However, this will prevent you from using most parts of Sumdog.</p>


<h3><a name="PrivacyPolicy-Informationwecollectautomaticallyfromusers"></a>Information we collect automatically from users</h3>

<p>We also use analytics software to help us understand how Sumdog is used. Information recorded by this software is anonymized, and cannot be related to individuals.&nbsp;To help us optimise our email communication, we may use customised links, or small images called web beacons. These allow us to understand how our messages are received by our users.</p>

<p>We will keep your personal information as long as your Sumdog account exists.  We may also need to keep your information to comply with our legal obligations, or to resolve disputes or enforce our agreements.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to delete your account after a long period of inactivity. We will make reasonable efforts to contact you using either Parent User or Teacher User email addresses before we do so.</p>

We have no control over the practices or privacy policies of any third parties, so you should make sure that you understand and are satisfied with them before allowing this.</p>

<p>As part of the provision of Sumdog, we may contract third parties to provide services which require us to share your information with them. Examples of this include sending you messages by email, storing or processing data, and processing payment. These third parties have no right to use your information except as required to provide these services.</p>

<p>If we permit you to add information to a create profile on Sumdog, this information may be displayed to other users.</p>
