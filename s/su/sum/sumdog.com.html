We use this to personalise your user experience for a particular country and to detect illegal use of our software. This information is not used to develop a personal profile of you.</p>

	<li>to personalise our services for you</li>
	<li>to provide you with your licensing or login information.</li>
	<li>to identify breaches of our licensing terms, so in the worst cases of abuse we may take action against illegal use. This helps maintain free services and lower prices for our law-abiding customers;</li>
	<li>to request feedback from you about our services so that we may improve the service; and</li>
