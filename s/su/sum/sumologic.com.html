<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you log into our service or when you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@sumologic.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support@sumologic.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
<p>Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Sumo Logic and our partners including marketing automation, heat mapping technology, advertising, demand marketing and web analytics partners. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
<p>We use cookies in our order form, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use cookies and similar technologies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> (or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p> <strong>Clear Gifs</strong></p>
<p>Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.</p>
<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>
<p>As is true of most Web sites, we use a third party tracking-utility partner to gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.</p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Local Storage Objects</strong></p>
<p>We use Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. </p>
<h3>Social Media Features</h3>
<p>Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.</p>
<h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>
<p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Sumo Logic. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.</p>
<h3>Public Forums</h3>
<p>Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@sumologic.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support@sumologic.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. We encourage all users to exercise caution when providing personal information in the blog or community forum.</p>
<h3>Surveys</h3>
<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information such as your name, company, and email or telephone number, and demographic information such as your title and the size of company you represent.</p>
<p>We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), to send participants an email newsletter.</p>
<p>We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personal information for any other purpose. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>
<h3>Referrals</h3>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Sumo Logic stores this information for tracking purposes to keep a record of how and when the information was originally obtained.</p>
<p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@sumologic.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support@sumologic.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<h3>Testimonials</h3>
<p>We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name.

<h3>Notification of Privacy Statement Changes</h3>
<p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you or our Client by email (sent to the email address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
