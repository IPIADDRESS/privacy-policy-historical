<li>Information about your transactions with us</li>
<li>Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency</li>
<li>Information we receive from Market Research Companies and websites (including email addresses)</li>
</ul>

<p>We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, as permitted by law.</p>

<p><strong>PARTIES WHO RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM US</strong></p>

<p>We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to the following types of third parties:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Financial service providers, such as insurance companies and mortgage service companies</li>
<li>Non-financial companies, such as consumer reporting agencies, data processors, check/share draft printers, financial statement publishers/printers, plastic card processors, government agencies and mailhouses</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO PARTIES THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO US</strong></p>

<p>In order for us to conduct the business of the credit union, we may disclose all of the 
information we collect, as described above, to other financial institutions with whom we have 
joint marketing agreements, to other companies that perform marketing services on our 
behalf, or to nonaffiliated third parties for the purposes of processing and servicing transactions 
that you request or authorize, so that we may provide members competitive products 
and services.</p>

<p>We may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you under circumstances as permitted or required by law.</p>

Please note that while at this time, we have not established any relationship that this opt-out will apply toward, there may be an opportunity in the future that we feel is beneficial for you.
