                        <ul>
                            <li>To make our Site more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.</li>
                            <li>We also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions, however, please note that certain aspects of the Site or Services may not be available if the Persistent Cookies are removed.</li>
                            <li>We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us measure the performance of our online campaigns or analyze visitor activity on the Site. We may permit these service providers to use cookies and other technologies to perform these services for us. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our PP. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>In general, Personal Data is used either to respond to requests that you make or to aid us in serving you better. We use such Personal Data in the following ways:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>to facilitate the creation of and secure your Account on our network;</li>
                            <li>identify you as a user in our system;</li>
                            <li>provide improved administration of our Site and Services;</li>
                            <li>provide the Services you request;</li>

                            <li>respond to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests;</li>
                            <li>to make telephone calls to you, from time to time, as a part of secondary fraud protection or to solicit your feedback; and</li>
                            <li>to send newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials related to our Services and for other marketing purposes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Unless we have a separate authorization from the data subject, we will not use the Commerce Data we collect for any reason other than to provide the Services the Subscriber requests and improve the quality of experience when the Subscriber interacts with our Site or Services. For illustration purposes only, we may use the name of a customer of Subscriber to help the Subscriber analyze that particular customer’s spending habits as part of our Services, but we will never contact that customer directly for marketing purposes.</p>
                       
                        <h2>4. Anonymous User Data</h2> 
                        <p>We may create Anonymous Data records from Visitor, Subscriber and Commerce Data by subjecting it to de-identification through the removal of all personally identifying data (including, but not limited to, names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses) and through the use of generally accepted statistical de-identification techniques.
                        <br><br>
                        SumAll may use Anonymous Data, for illustration purposes only, to generate benchmarks and indices as part of our Service, to issue a press release as to the total revenue amount of our U.S. customers, to produce analysis of shopping cart abandonment rates, or to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve Site navigation. SumAll reserves the right to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties at its sole discretion.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>5. Advertising</h2> 
                        <p>We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.
