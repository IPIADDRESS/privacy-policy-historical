<p>2. How we will use information we collect about you</p>
<p>Whenever you give us your personal information, legally we have to use it in accordance with the terms of various privacy laws, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (we refer to these laws in this privacy policy as the 'privacy laws').</p>
<p><br> 2a) When you use our websites</p>
<p>When you give us information while using our websites, we will use it for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, on the data entry forms, in any relevant terms or conditions and on pages or emails which link to the data entry forms.</p>
<p><br> This information does not allow us to identify you. We collect it from lots of visitors to our websites and analyse it. This lets us build up a picture of how people use our websites. This helps us improve the services we offer.</p>
<p><br> We may also give anonymous statistics about users to other, reputable organisations, but the information we provide will not include details that would allow these organisations to identify you.</p>

<p>We may use the information you give us about yourself when you register on or for our online services, or the information we collect via cookies when you use our online services to build up a picture of your interests. We may then use this information to try to make sure that when you visit our websites or use our online services, you don't miss offers and information that might interest you. This is called advert targeting or interest based advertising.</p>
<p><br> 2c) Tracking how our online services are used</p>

<li>target the adverts or offers, such as banners, on our online services and on the websites and other online services of other organisations; and</li>
<li>track the use of our internet banner adverts and other links from our marketing partners' websites to our websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For these purposes, we and the other organisations we use keep information on the path you take to get to our online services and on some of the pages you visit or use through our online services, using cookies, web beacons and other on-device storage. You cannot be personally identified from the information that we or these other organisations collect. For information about web beacons, or the organisation we use (including how to decline their cookies), please read our Cookie Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2d) Commercial use of data</p>
<p>From time to time the company may ask you for permission to use your data commercially. If you give us this right then we will use your data and share it with carefully selected third parties who will be bound by certain restraints imposed on them by the company at the time of the transaction.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>2e) Testimonials</p>
<p>If you give us feedback, we may use it to improve our products and services and we may publish it online or offline to promote our business, products and services. We will ask for your permission before we publish it.</p>
<p><br> 2f) Comments submitted to our online blogs and articles</p>
<p>If you wish to submit a comment or feedback on a blog or article featured on our website, we may (but are not obliged to) publish your comment online or offline to promote our business, products and services. We will collect your name which will be displayed next to your comment, and e-mail address, which will not be published, but which we may use to contact you in relation to your comment.</p>

<p>For information on how we may market to you, please read section 4 -&nbsp;Direct marketing and how you can change your marketing preferences.</p>
<p><br> 2h) User surveys</p>
<p>Every now and again, we may ask you for your opinion on our products and services. When we do surveys we may use cookies or other on-device storage and may combine the information collected by those cookies or other on-device storage with your answers. We will make sure that the survey results do not identify you, or anyone else who fills in our surveys.</p>
<p><br> 3. When we contact you</p>
<p>We may contact you:</p>
<ul>
<li>about information you have asked for, in order to answer your request;</li>
<li>if you have given us feedback, to discuss that feedback or ask your permission to publish it;</li>
<li>if you have chosen to receive further information from us;</li>
<li>to invite you to take part in surveys about our products and services (it is always up to you whether you want to take part);</li>
<li>for marketing purposes, unless you tell us to stop</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Direct marketing and how you can manage your marketing preferences</p>
<p>From time to time we may offer you the chance to receive important news from our group and information about our products and services, such as changes to the way you can use our online services or new services and special offers you might be interested in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will ask you if you want to receive direct marketing if you</p>
<p>register for one of our services; or</p>
<p>enter a competition or register for a promotion with any company in our group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless you tell us otherwise, we may contact you by phone, post, email, text message or any other way (electronic or otherwise). We will normally send you direct marketing by email if we have your email address.</p>
<p><br> If you would like us to stop sending direct marketing to you, we offer simple ways for you to tell us to stop. Whenever you receive direct marketing from us, we will tell you how to unsubscribe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you tell us that you do not want to receive direct marketing, we will still contact you in order to provide you with services you request and for administration purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Who we may share your personal information with</p>

<li>data processing companies, mailing houses and other third party suppliers working on our behalf;</li>
<li>government and enforcement agencies, such as Trading Standards and the police.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every now and again, we receive requests for information from government departments, the police and other enforcement agencies. If this happens, and there is a proper legal basis for providing your personal information, we will provide it to the organisation asking for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Where we process your personal information</p>
<p>When we use your information as described in section 2 -&nbsp;How we will use information we collect about you, this may occasionally involve sending your information outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
