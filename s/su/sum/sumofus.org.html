												<h1><b>SumOfUs Privacy Policy &amp; Terms of Use</b></h1>
<p>SumOfUs has created this privacy policy to explain how SumOf Us (or “we”) use information that we collect from you while you visit the SumOf Us website, currently located at <a href="http://www.sumofus.org">www.sumofus.org</a> (the “Site”). SumOfUs may modify this policy from time to time so we encourage you to check this page when revisiting the Site.&nbsp; The date of the most recent revision is listed below.</p>
<h2><b>How We Use Your Information</b></h2>
<p>When you register, contribute, sign up to volunteer, or take any other action on our Site, we may ask you to give us contact information, including your name, address, telephone number and/or e-mail address. We may also obtain information about you from outside sources and combine it with the information we collect through this Site. We use this information to operate this Site, send you news and information about the SumOfUs movement, solicit your participation in programs, events and activities, and obtain and confirm RSVP’s to events and programs. You may opt-out of receiving messages from SumOfUs by sending any email to <a href="mailto:info@sumofus.org">info@sumofus.org</a> and asking that you not receive future email messages.&nbsp; You may also opt-out by following the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email.</p>
<p>Other than as stated in the following section, we will never provide any of your personal information to any other person or organization, except for vendors providing services to SumOfUs who have agreed to keep your information confidential, or if you specifically authorize us to share your information.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may provide information to third parties in the aggregate.</p>
<h2><b>Signing Petitions and Sending E-Mails</b></h2>
<p>When you sign a petition or complete a survey on our Site, we consider your name, city, state/province and comments as public information.&nbsp; For example, we may provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to the public official, company or person to whom the petition is addressed, and/or to the press and/or public online.We will not, however, make your street address publicly available, although we may transmit it to the recipient of the petition. In addition, we may disclose your e-mail address to the recipient of a petition. As a result, you may receive an e-mail response directly from the recipient of the petition. SumOfUs is not responsible for further use of your e-mail address by the recipient of a petition.</p>
<p>We will also use your first name to indicate on the Site that you have taken action.</p>
<h2><b>Donations and Credit Card Information</b></h2>
<p>When you contribute to SumOfUs online, we collect credit card information from you. That information is used solely for processing your contribution; it is not maintained by SumOfUs; and is never disclosed to anyone, for any other purpose other than for processing your contribution.</p>
<h2><b>Security</b></h2>
<p>SumOfUs uses industry standard security measures to protect the information collected by this Site, but we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
<h2><b>Children</b></h2>
<p>SumOfUs does not knowingly solicit personally identifying information from children under 13 years of age.&nbsp; We will promptly remove any personal information from children under 13 upon notice to us.</p>
<h2><b>Advertising</b></h2>
<p>We may place online advertising with third-party vendors, including Google, which will be shown on other sites on the internet. In some cases, those third-party vendors may decide which ads to show you based on your prior visits to the Site. At no time will you be personally identified to those third-party vendors, nor will any of the personal information you share with us be shared with those third-party vendors. If you prefer to opt out of the use of these third-party cookies on the Site, you can do so by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.</p>
<h2><b>Cookies and Data Tracking</b></h2>
<p>In order to better serve our supporters, we use cookies and periodically analyze web logs.&nbsp; Some cookies are used to prepopulate forms for you so that on repeat visits to the Site you don’t need to reenter certain information.&nbsp; You can set your browser to disable cookies, but then you would not have the advantage of having certain sections of forms being prepopulated for you, and you may not be able to access certain parts of the Site.&nbsp; We may also use third-party services such as Google Analytics. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our Site. We may also use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our mailings, so that we can tell which mailings appeal most to SumOfUs supporters.</p>
<p>The information generated by a cookie about your use of our Site (including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where Google is legally required, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google can combine your IP address with any other data held by Google. By using this Site, you consent to the processing of data by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>
<p>URLs contained in emails may contain an ID that enables us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page. We use these URLs to simplify the process of signing petitions and filling out surveys. We may occasionally present a shortened URL that references a longer URL which you can see in the browser’s address bar when you access the page.</p>
<h2><b>Links to Other Sites</b></h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to ANY external links or any website not owned and operated by SumOfUs. Third party sites will have their own policies which may be different from ours and we recommend that you check the privacy policy of each site that you visit.</p>
<h2><b>Disclosure of Information</b></h2>
<p>SumOfUs will challenge any attempt to gain access to the information you give us by government agencies or private organizations. In the unlikely event that we are required by law to disclose any of your information we will do our best to contact you first so that you may have the opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will also independently object to any requests for access to information about users of our Site that we believe to be improper.</p>
