Everyone working for SumOfUs.org is also signed up as a member and we treat your privacy as we do our own.</p><p>SumOfUs.org has created this privacy notice to explain how we use information that you may provide while visiting our website and to demonstrate our firm commitment to Internet privacy. SumOfUs.org may modify this policy from time to time so we encourage you to check this page when revisiting this website.</p><h2>How We Use Your Information</h2><p>SumOfUs.org will use the information you provide to build a global movement to hold multinational corporations accountable for their actions and inaction.</p><p>When you register, contribute, sign up to volunteer, or take any other action on our site, we may ask you to give us contact information, including your name, address, telephone number and/or e-mail address. We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add it to or combine it with the information we collect through this site. We use this information to operate this site, send you news and information to you about SumOfUs.org movement, solicit your participation in programs, events and activities, and obtain and confirm RSVP’s to events and programs. We use your e-mail address to send such information by e-mail and may use your telephone number to call you for these purposes.</p><p>Submitting your personal information including e-mail address on this page will sign you up to receive e-mails from SumOfUs.org.</p><p>We will never provide your e-mail address or any of your personal information to any other person or organization, for any purpose except for vendors providing services to SumOfUs.org in relation to our website or database, but only if those vendors are also bound to maintain this information in confidence.</p><h2>Signing Petitions and Sending E-Mails</h2><p>For petitions and surveys you’ve signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state/province and comments as public information – for example, we may provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to the public official, company or person to whom the petition is addressed, and/or to the press and/or public online.</p><p>We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to recipient of the petition. In addition, we may disclose your e-mail address to the recipient of a petition. As a result, you may receive an e-mail response directly from the recipient of the petition. SumOfUs.org is not responsible for further use of your e-mail address by the recipient of a petition.</p><p>We will also use your first name to indicate the latest actions taken on this site.</p><h2>Donations and Credit Card Information</h2><p>When you contribute to SumOfUs.org online, we collect credit card information from you. That information is used solely for processing your contribution; is not maintained by SumOfUs.org; and is never disclosed to anyone, for any other purpose other than for processing your contribution, under any circumstances.</p><p>SumOfUs.org uses industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. Our server is located in a locked, secure environment. Permission to access your information is granted only to you and SumOfUs.org employees or contractors who need to know that information to provide services to you. Although we make good faith efforts to store information collected by this website in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee complete security.</p><h2>Children</h2><p>SumOfUs.org does not solicit personally identifying information from children. Visitors who are under 13 years of age should ask their parent or legal guardian for assistance when using the Site and should not submit any personally identifying information to the site. For example, visitors under 13 years of age should not make donations or take any actions on or through this site.</p><h2>Cookies</h2><p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. If you wish to disable these cookies, the help portion of the tool bar on most browsers will tell you how do that. If you set your browser to disable cookies, however, you may not be able to access certain parts of this site.</p><h2>Advertising</h2><p>We may place online advertising with third-party vendors, including Google, which will be shown on other sites on the internet. In some cases, those third-party vendors may decide which ads to show you based on your prior visits to the site. At no time will you be personally identified to those third-party vendors, nor will any of the information you share with us be shared with those third-party vendors. If you prefer to opt out of the use of these third-party cookies on the site, you can do so by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.</p><h2>Data Tracking</h2><p>In order to better serve our supporters, we use cookies and periodically analyze web logs. We may also use third-party services such as Google Analytics. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our website. We may also use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our mailings, so that we can tell which mailings appeal most to SumOfUs.org supporters.</p><p>The information generated by a cookie about your use of our website (including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where Google is legally required, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google can combine your IP address with any other data held by Google. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p><p>URLs contained in emails may contain an ID that enables us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page. We use these URLs to simplify the process of signing petitions and filling out surveys. We may occasionally present a shortened URL that references a longer URL which contains an id—we do this to simplify the display, to prevent links from becoming broken when copied, and to ensure compatibility with email programs which do not handle long URLs. When a shortened URL is displayed in an email, you will see the full URL in the browser’s address bar when you access the page.</p><h2>Links to Other Sites</h2><p>The privacy policies and practices contained in this Privacy Statement do not apply to ANY external links.
